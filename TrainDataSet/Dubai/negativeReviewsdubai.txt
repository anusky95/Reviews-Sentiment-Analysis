N =>   Disappointed but perhaps things will improve     
N =>  Impressive find  
Not   star We stayed in a   bedroom suite  apartment   These suits are not in the main building  but in a separate building with its own reception etc  Getting to the hotel building and swimming pool etc is only possible via the street Size of apartments are OK  Nothing special  They are furnished in a very traditional hotel style  No dishwasher in the kitchen  Washing machine available Maintenance is in the hotel is very poor  We needed   times a maintenance guy during our   days stay  The hotel pool is missing tiles etc  I am wondering what this place will look like in   years   Cleaning staff is very friendly  The reception staff  only speaking about the Suites reception  is absolutely not on   star level  You don t feel really as an appreciated guest  Some with the Bell boys  Never during our stay they opened the front door for us  Even not when one of us was struggling to get the baby stroller in Location is great for shopping lovers  Opposite the Dubai Mall  You can walk to there  At the moment you still need to walk through the dirt  but it looked like the pavements will be finished within the next months  Beach is far away  The Murooj complex includes a   HR supermarket with home delivery service Be aware  at the front site of the Suites Building is a lot of traffic  Partly on bridges  Our first room was on the second floor  After the first night we switched rooms because we could hear the cars clearly in our room  For families the hotel is well equipped  Of course the      bedroom suites a convenient  The swimming pool is good for children  no slides or something   including an area with just a  cm deep water  where babies can play in the water Would I stay here again  Most probably not  There are way better Apartment hotels in Dubai  riott ina or Oasis  which are really   star  Service at the Murooj Rotana is not more than you can expect from a   star hotel  
N =>  don t like it nice location but the construction in the roads make it messy  the staff not well trained  expensive internet  the cleanliness not that good but it s average 
Nice stay at the heart of the city Staying at Al Murooj Rotana was a great experience  with its location at the heart of the city and next to dubai mall  quot world s largest mall quot  its an ideal option if you d like to have a break while still being at the city The room was very luxurios and clean with balcony viewing the pool  the room service is super  they just do things in a record of time The breakfast was very good  u ll find a variety of tasty and delecious food till       am  in addition the have a variety of restaurants what I didnt like about it was just the long time vallet took to get my car  quot  that happened for   or   times quot  and the  quot relatively long quot  time they took to finalize our check out and the small lobby which get crowded with russian girls at night  
N =>  Great Choice if you want a  Resort  feel     This was a quick  quot Girls quot  weekend getaway  While the Rotana family has over    hotels in Dubai  I chose this one as from the reviews  it seemed to have a nice  quot resort quot  feel  Glad I DID   Just as others have stated  you were welcomed with smiles and never a bother  I always book  quot Club Rooms quot  as I think it s definitely worth the extra cost  ie free internet  afternoon snacks and most importantly  quot unlimited alcoholic drinks quot  in the evenings  On one nite  they had a display of Sushi that was just scrumptious  and I don t eat just anyone s Sushi   One morning we decided to try the breakfast in the main lobby         uh        no  It was like a circus and had to find someone to just to pour us some coffee  As far as the rooms  they are really nice but SMALL  If you need space  upgrade to a suite   Unfortunately  for us they were all booked and tried to accomodate us by putting us in an two bedroom apartment  We told them we d like to  quot see it quot  first and then decide  Well     it s HUGE  but is not as updated in style and decor in its interior as the rest of the hotel  Thanks for trying   It s better suited for longer stays  Had a wonderful massage for half price  quot summer special quot  and the Club lounge also gave us two free alcoholic drink coupons upon check in at the  quot Double ker quot  Pub  Had a scumptious lunch at  quot Zaika quot  Indian restaurant  Would I stay there again  You BET   
N =>  Resot like ambience The approach to the hotel was marred by the construction activity around  However  inside the hotel everything was good  The staff was helpful when I was looking at excursion options  Room service was prompt and within the time limit they mentioned while placing the order I tried two restaurants and both exceeded my expectations  
N =>   Mixed feelings  My partner and I arrived in Dubai on a midnight flight  We had a four night stay booked on the Club Floor which included limousine pickup  We were looking forward to being welcomed by our limousine pick up however one never arrived  We were told by reception that we never organised a pick up although they could tell me of the flight we were to arrive in on  only mentioned in the email requesting pick up   We were told to catch a cab     minute wait in    degree heat at  am  and they would reimburse us which they did  We then arrived at reception to be told yet again that we had not organised a car pick up but mentioned my email   Contradictions were rife   My partner and I were then placed in a non smoking room that wreaked of smoke  We were told no other rooms available until the following day  The shower then lost pressure about seven times so needless to say I was at my wits end and ready to find another hotel the following day  We made our way to breakfast on the Club Floor to be greeted by an extremely friendly yet professional young lady  She kindly advised that they had another room for us and that concierge would organise the luggage  We had breakfast and found the young gentleman especially Vyksh  apologise if incorrect spelling  to be wonderful  The service supplied to us by the staff on the   th floor were outstandng and turned our stay around  The concierge were also all extremely polite and willing to assist with any enquiries we had which made our stay more pleasurable  I can not however say the same about the staff on the main reception in the foyer  We found them rude  non willing to help and did not follow up on issues we had encountered We were given a complimentary dinner in the Pergolas restaurant for the inconvenience on the first night which we were advised included drinks however our we were billed woth these drinks on our check out   They hesitantly removed these in the end   We are still awaiting for the refund of the deposit taken from our credit card however if we only dealt with the fantastic staff on the   th floor we would stay again otherwise definitely not  
Nice hotel friendly staff  Pity about the construction around the hotel though    Stayed at the Al Murooj Rotana for   nights on business in Dubai  It s a nice   star hotel  a    dirham taxi ride from the airport  Reception is quite impressive   lots of marble  fountains  chrome etc  and incredibly efficient and friendly staff I arrived at       on a Saturday morning  and the downstairs disco was pumping very loud music out  with several people spilling out of the club and onto the driveway up to reception  Not the greatest first impression  but I was put in a room on the  th floor  so it really didn t bother me in the least My room was average sized for Dubai  in the UK  it would be huge  but hotels in Dubai all seem to be much larger than their European counterparts   and well appointed  with the usual minibar   plasma TV   phone  amp  TV volume in the bathroom   air con   dressing gown  amp  slippers  and a nice separate desk and comfortable working chair by the window  I overlooked the rear of the hotel  so could see the   or   separate swimming pools  outside bar  and patio area below The food was excellent   there are   or   different restaurants on site  and I ate in the buffet restaurant on a couple of occasions  Lots of choice  vast selections of salads  breads  and desserts  and a central area with a couple of chefs who will happily cook the fresh chicken  steak  and fish available  Lots of kiddie friendly options too   although I was away on business  I spotted plenty of food that my   year old would have happily eaten The only time I found the bar at the hotel was on my first night   after an   hour flight  I fancied a quick beer before hitting the sack  so found the Bus Stop English Pub     yep  after flying halfway across the world from England  I found that the hotel had an Olde Worlde English pub in the basement  It seemed quite a trendy place to drink  so had very loud music and plasma TVs everywhere showing MTV  but the beer was cold and hit the spot The only downside to the hotel  and this is a problem with much of Dubai at the moment  is the scale of construction going on all around the hotel  For example  the Dubai Mall is only about     metres from the hotel  but standing in between is an   lane dual carriageway  plus a construction site  which means that you have to take a    minute taxi ride round the oneway system  only to end up a stones throw from where you began  It s also worth noting that construction is worked on    hours a day  and although it didn t affect me  I suspect that this was due to my room being on a high floor  A few other reviewers have reported quite a lot of noise on lower floors  so make sure you ask for a high floor when you book All in all  a good business hotel  and one that I d stay at again  Only downer was the very expensive internet access  about    GBP per day   
Nice place good location Stayed on business   nights  excellent rooms  attentive service  Breakfast buffet was alright  lunch quite good  Free shuttle service to from airport worked flawless  A lot of roadwork and construction around the premises makes it feel dusty and secluded  The pool is nice but not outstanding  Gym is OK  Very nice rooms and bathrooms  only thing missing was free WIFI on the rooms  
Nice suites for families My family and I  husband    kids of    and    yeards old  stayed there for   nights while we were arranging our last things before moving from Dubai  We had a   bedroom suite  it was very good because it came fully equipped and that helped us a lot The bathroom could be updated and there was no a c in them  which was not a problem for us because it was winter but during summer it can be very annoying  The room was ok  comfortable bed and enough space The service is not the best  they take ages to bring something when you ask  I waited nearly   hour  after calling   times  for tea towels  before that they brought bathrobes and some towels   but that is common in Dubai because people there hardly speak any English  The location was very good before  but with all the construction taking place around the Hotel it can get very difficult to move around  We went to the Dubai Mall  which is opposite the street  and it took us more than    minutes to drive back to the Hotel because of the bad signals and the confusion of the streets Also because of the construction of a main highway in front of the Hotel try to get a room in the highest floors or pool view  because of the noise We highly recommend More Cafe   we loved it  A good option if you are looking for a family suite but if you want something else there are better and nicer hotels in Dubai  
N =>   Disaster I had been on a business meeting at Al Murooj my stay at the hotel was disaster firstly when I reached airport there was no airport representative I was asked to go to the airport desk at United car rental at airport where I was provided a car after a long wait when I reached hotel the Doorman was unfriendly he did not greet me there was no bellman to take luggage at reception I found that room was not ready I had to wait for   hours to get my room I was very hungry but I was not offered any complimentary juice or cookies The reception staff was unfriendly the staff was not professional I went to concierge for car booking where baabasaab the concierge gave me car to abu dhabi for AED     where same car costs AED     Anyways in the room the room menu was too small no options Housekeeping was good the room was clean I was upset with my stay bcoz of unfriendly staff specially front desk I would not advise you to visit this hotel as it is good but no good  
N =>  I am in love with Al Murooj My wifead I have stayed to the Al Murooj several times between      and       Everytime it was an excellent experience  I really miss the hotel now that we work in the States and don t have anymore business to go to Dubai  
N =>   Good hotel but expensive Business hotel  well connected by roads  etc    Good gym and pool  however be prepared to pay through the nose here  
N =>   Would not stay again We stayed in this hotel for three days on our way out to Mauritius for our honeymoon  the hotel was aware this was our honeymoon but made no effort to make it feel special  unlike the Hilton in Mauritius We had booked a non smoking room but there were none available at the time of check in and as we had just had a   hour overnight flight  we didn t want to wait around for another to become available  all we wanted to do was sleep  This is a business hotel I would not recommend it for families or for a romantic getaway  I suppose we were disappointed as it was part of our honeymoon and there was no atmosphere in the hotel  mainly business men There was also a scent in the lobby when you came through the doors which I think was supposed to smell nice   It was very overpowering and sickly I love Dubai as I worked over there for a while there is so much to do  I should have gone with the hotels I know  we just wanted to try somewhere different  
Not for a holiday  I stayed here shortly after it s opening in ch      It is the only hotel from which I have demanded to be relocated  It was booked late from the UK and it seemed like a good holiday choice but beware    Avoid if you are going to Dubai for a beach type holiday  The location is between a motorway intersection  apartment complexes and some urban scrub land looking strangely like a camel farm  It is at least    minutes  drive to the beach due to a combination of heavy traffic and roadworks  and there is a substantial cost for access to a very indifferent beach when you get there   Forget about walking  pavements don t exist  You are totally stranded in this bizarre pseudo luxury bubble which is only good if you are here on business and going everywhere by car  The rooms are fine with nice facilities  Only a small pool was available and the grounds were the public areas of some apartment blocks nearby  The bar nightclub is a dreadful mock London pub with no atmosphere and surly door staff despite being totally empty  The reception staff became grumpy at the suggestion that all was not as had been advertised  I got on the phone to get us relocated to the nearest Hilton on Jumeirah beach which was a great improvement  Having said that  Dubai is dreadfully overrated and this is what happens when you ask someone to book a holiday for you  If you have been to   star hotels before  the shiny lobby won t be enough to impress  
N =>   enjoyable stay Being a first time visitor to Dubai we did a fair bit of research on a hotel to stay  We wasnt disappointed with this hotel  a lot of our friends stayed in the beach area  as we wasnt worried due to not being able to sit in the sun for long hours  this hotel was a great location  A high standard service  room was very clean  A lot of building going on but we found this amazing to see and glad we didnt miss the city views  We were given our room an hour after arriving sleepy at  am following a night flight  which was appreciated as check in isnt until late afternoon  We had pool view  Nice buffet breakfast  excellent choice of food  soya milk was provided which was welcome as I have a dairy intolerance  Good choice of resturants  double decker was a good pub atmosphere  the seafood resturant was our treat  We enjoyed being away from the tourist side of things  as the hotel really was occupied by lot of business clients  which made it pleasant and pool area quiet  Good access to shopping by taxis which were always available  Supermarket to rear of complex open    hrs and starbucks  Good hotel for couples My only moan was reception staff didnt always give you full attention  eg answering the phones when we were being dealt with as a customer  
N =>   Fabulous stay at the Al Murooj I stayed at the Al Murooj Rotana in Dubai in il of this year with my sister and daughter  We were delighted on arrival to be upgraded to a Club room free of charge  The hotel itself was extremely clean and the rooms very comfortable  We found the staff to be very attentive  Nothing was too much trouble from arranging taxis to booking trips  Others have complained that the hotel caters mainly for business guests but we found quite the opposite in that they had a good knowledge of places to visit  eat and trips to take  We cannot fault the staff in any way  We dined in the hotel on a couple of occasions and found the food to be of a very good standard  We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in Dubai and felt this was enhanced by our choice of hotel  I would have no hesitation in recommending the Al Murooj Rotana to anyone wanting to see the sights of Dubai  If it is a beach holiday you are looking for  then you may be better advised to stay at one of the beachfront hotels  but if you are looking to see the sights of Dubai then I don t think you could do better than the Al Murooj for location and price  
N =>  Very clean and friendly Just returned from a   night stay in Dubai  Our travel agent found us this hotel as we wanted a room where our   year old daughter could stay with us  This is classed as a   star but I would give it a  star       It is in the city area just off the main highway a short taxi ride from everywhere  The food in the restraunts was fab  As was the service at the pool  If you can try to upgrade to a club suite  extra benefits are well worth it  
N =>   Average We had booked a club room having done so in other hotels  including the Grand Hyatt in Dubai  but found the Club Rotana rooms to be below our expectations After a superb overnight flight with BA we arrived at the hotel early and were taken to the club lounge for check in  as expected the room was not ready but after a leisurely breakfast we were told it had been cleaned  We were a little suprised that our room was on the  rd floor bearing in mind that the lounge was on the   th and we expected club rooms to be in a similar vacinity and when we arrived at the room we were convinced that it was only a standard room  It was very small with a small bathroom where the shower was over the bath not in a separate cubicle as we would have expected  After falling asleep we woke later to find our suitcases had not arrived at which point we went back to the lounge to complain  We were told the room was a standard but with club privaledges and infact club rooms were identical but just on a higher floor  We spent the night in a room on the  th floor and the following day they transferred us to a suite on the  rd  which was nicer but in reality only the same size and spec as we were expecting a club room to be On the whole I would say that for the size of the complex everything to do with the hotel itself is small  the rooms  the lobby  the club lounge  the pool  In essence an average stay at an averge hotel although the canapes in the lounge were very nice  Eat at the Latino restaurant and the Indian restaurant   food ok both very expensive Not a terrible stay but the next time we go to Dubai we will not be staying here 
N =>  Could do better Whilst we d read mixed reviews we were not put off by local construction work  after all  Dubai is undergoing an amazing transformation  and were delighted to have a view overlooking the Burj Towers site  how wonderful to see what a difference a year makes in this great city      Our room was lovely  we d upgraded to a club floor to enjoy the benefits this afforded us but in all honesty  unless you re a business traveller  in which case it s a great investment  the only benefit was the room  we had to wait for tables in the lounge and the breakfast offering was only ok  However  the room was very spacious  spotless  big bathroom featuring elemis products  always a bonus   Little things count though in a   star hotel  and we were constantly comparing this hotel to the Hilton Dubai Creek in which we d stayed last year  and  it has to be said  we were blown away by the place    Our morning paper didn t arrive and yet although we d told our concierge this  we were still charged for it  The concierge team really had very little local knowledge  in fact several members of the staff directed us to Crystal C bar in the hotel on the night it was closed  a wasted half an hour traipsing round the complex     This hotel has tremendous potential to rival some of the other   star hotels in Dubai  the views alone are astounding  But let s not forget  Dubai does   stars exceptionally well and so the Al Murooj has to raise its game  I feel that the hotel is a sideline for the whole complex  guests are not treated in any way special and that for me was the disappointment  after all  in Dubai that s what we expected following our previous visit When checking out  we were treated appallingly by the front desk who wrangled over a tub of cashew nuts we hadn t had and adopted a very effective shoulder shrugging technique which did not go down well with my husband at  am  A fellow guest waiting to check in was left to stand unattended at the front desk for    minutes before anyone even acknowledged his presence It s also worth mentioning that we visited to attend the Dubai World Cup and although many guests there were also attending  the hotel had decided not to offer a courtesy shuttle bus  something many other hotels had provided for their guests So  in summary  a great hotel for business travellers located midway on the Sheikh Zayed Road  Leisure travellers  well  I believe you can find a hotel that would better suit your needs  
N =>  Everything I expected from a   star hotel  
N => Highly recommended  
N =>  I m Back  
N => Truly superb location   service comfort This was not our first visit to Dubai and we have stayed in several hotels including the sister Jumeirah Beach hotel which we loved  However the Al Qasr at Madinat Jumeirah has a more traditional Arabic d cor and ambience  From the minute we arrived the staff could not do enough for us and considering the hotel was full because of the half term school holidays we still had prompt attentive service  A welcome drink and face towels were supplied with a smile as we sat on a couch to check in  We arrived early morning after an overnight flight and as our bedroom would not be ready until the afternoon we were shown to a comfy lounge with shower facilities and changing rooms  Once changed we went down to breakfast with an amazing choice of good high quality food on offer  The waitress service was prompt in offering you tea or coffee then you could help yourself to the endless array of fresh fruit  yoghurts  breads  porridge  or any variation of cooked breakfast with the eggs cooked freshly to your choice  By       I had a message on my mobile phone to say the room was now in fact ready and our luggage would be taken up for us  The bedroom was spacious very comfortable well decorated and spotlessly clean  The bath room was large with separate shower and bath and  His and Hers  toiletries  A veranda with chairs had a view over the front entrance were all the Rolls Royce  Ferrari s  Bentleys and other expensive cars were parked  The hotel has numerous restaurants too many to mention but I would recommend you book a table early in your stay to avoid disappointment as many were full during our stay  There is a nice safe beach adjoining the hotel and the Wild Wadi Water Adventure Park  where hotels guest get free admission  is minuets away by the courtesy golf cart A great way to see the hotel grounds and to get to some of the restaurants is to use the Abra s the small  taxi  boats that sail around the hotels waterways All in all this is a fabulous hotel with charming friendly staff and great facilities we cant wait to return on our next visit to Dubai 
N => Nice hotel minor points to get it to true    My husband and I stayed at the Al Qasr during the second leg of our honeymoon  first being in the Maldives   true luxury   Overall  we had a lovely stay in this hotel however in our opinion  it did not quite live up to the expectation of luxury that it sells itself on  I did a lot of research prior to booking this hotel and do not regret it  perhaps i would have stayed at the Mina instead as the Al Qasr was full of Russian families as it must have accepted a number of package holiday bookings  On the plus side  it is huge  part of the Madinat resort which is great in terms of location and things to do  It has plenty of restaurant choices  souks for shopping  a great bar  try to get the table on the balcony which looks on to the Burj  and a great afternoon tea place which appeared to be favoured more by locals than tourists Downsides were breaksfast  great choice but given full occupancy of the hotel  felt like a cattle farm   the size of the place  this place is vast  you need buggys and little boats to transport you around so you need to plan things like going to the beach as it could take up to   mins to get there from your room   service was not quite on par with true     we had a problem with our shower  this was reported on the first night  the next day and then again the following day to the duty manager before an engineer came to have a look  all the time we had to have a bath and were not adequately compensated   The other disappointment was the room  we had an Arabian Deluxe which was relatively small and the shower was opposite the toilet with only a shower curtain partition  not quite what I expect from a    hotel Overall  it was a good hotel but in my experience  not quite what I would have expected given the amount they charge per room  We went to a few of the other hotels in Dubai and they are all luxurious  all huge and all have similar facilities  The Madinat is a great location and for that I would choose to stay here again  but would probably stay at the Mina instead  
N =>   Perfect  We stayed for three nights while travelling back to Australia at the start of tember The only way to describe the resort complex is magnificent  We hired a ior Suite which included transfers and executive lounge access  The lounge had one of the most extravagant breakfasts I have come across  everything from quail eggs to camel milk porridge  The complementary evening drinks and afternoon tea was wonderful  The room was magnificent  the service perfect This was a bit of a treat for us following   weeks of independent travel around Europe  We had never really stayed in a resort before  it just hasn t been our thing to do  this hotel lived up to all it promised and more I would highly recommend staying here as an excellent way of winding down after weeks of travel or just to spoil yourself  Thankfully we were warned not make too many plans while in Dubai as you wont want to leave the resort Also if you get a chance you must try Pierchic for a first class dinning experience  
N =>   Anniversary Besides living in Dubai  we decided to stay at Al Qasr to celebrate our Anniversary    and it was just lovely  The standards of Jumeirah Hotels is great  we had a great view from our room   overlooking the hotel s water channels  the beach  the BURJ     
N =>   Absolutely fabulous Hotel  We stayed last weekend in the Al Quasr for   days on a stop over to Mauritius with our two children    mth   yrs   We arrived in the morning and were met by the friendly reception staff and were offered an upgrade to the Summer House which we can only recommend for its tranquility and privacy  Mahesh our personal butler  and I would have hired him   was the most helpful hotel staff i met in years  We stayed in Villa    which has also access to its own private pool which was useful in case u didn t want to go to the big pool with your little ones which is great too  The food in the Arboretum was delicious and the variety was impressive  We will visit the Mina Al Salam on our return for   Days and we can t wait to take our children on the Arba trips  
N =>  Some disappointing points I stayed there in tember   not the best season for swimming in the sea  Though the air temperature was quite pleasant  the sea was over    degrees and very salty   in the water you feel like having a salt wrapping treatment in a hospital  The swimming pool water was fine  but pools are all very shallow   seems like around   m in depth I didn t like the sevice   it s not the appropriate level for the hotel charging      bucks for   night stay  The welcome service for our group was wonderful   champain and beautiful appetizers on a lovely terrace  but later every time I had questions or problems  it was hard to find someone from the staff who was ready to help me  I didn t like the buffet food for breakfast and lunch  Once we had lunch at Mina A Salam in the same Medinah Jumeira  it was much better   stay there instead The worst experience I had in spa  Massage was so so and it was always cold in the room  Besides  you can get to the spa center only by boat  Prepare to wait for the boat back to the hotel for a long time sitting on the bench under the sun  Once I was waiting for    minutes  Twice I went back to the spa center to confirm they had called the taxi boat  They were answering quite coldly  quot yes quot  and that was all  No apologies  no comments  When I tried to complaint at the reception   no comments again  Summarizing my experience  I had to admit the property itself is very luxuary  I stayed several times in famous   star hotels  but this is one of the best  
N =>   Great hotel too bad their Sirius reward program is seriously lacking Lovely hotel  We were well taken care of  However  the food at their Atrium restaurant was so so  Other than that  our experience was great  For people who are not interested in accumulating Sirius rewards points then I recommend staying here  However  if your decision to choose this hotel in lieu of another equvalent hotel in order to accumulate rewards points     well  think twice  I checked out on ust  th and today is tember   rd and my points are still not credited to my account   It s very frustrating because I am seriously trying to accumulate points prior to my next Dubai visit  I was really disappointed that their rewards program is not up to the standards of Jumeirah hotels I would recommend this hotel as long as the traveler is not interested in Sirius points  It has been an excersize in patience and I am fed up with sending emails asking that my account be credited  
N => Totally Magical I travelled to Dar al maysaf which is located within the Al qasr hotel wiyh my son  We had a great time and could not recomend the place enough it has all that one could need  The service was unbelieveable I met Rahoul and Milan Who manage the resort to tell them on the magnificient stay that i had  Anyone looking at this hotel as a place to stay just book it you will not be dissapointed  
N =>  excellent place for families We stayed at Al Qasr for   nights in ust  We had stayed in the Mina Salaam   yrs ago and liked it so much we decided to stay for   nights of our Honeymoon while travelling through Dubai  We were very impressed with the reception we received at the airport  the bottles of water and flannels in the very comfortable cab were a lovely touch  We found the service mostly good  the check in was very efficient and pleasant and the strawberries and chocolate with date sparkling drink very thoughtful  though champagne would have been even better    We really liked our room which must have been a suite  it was massive  We had upgraded to the club executive to avail of the lounge which we hadn t had on our first visit   For such a short visit I don t think it was worth the extra money as we ended up trying to fit it in to avail of it  The service in the lounge and the drinks and food were all excellent  The breakfast was amazing  everything possible available  I just wished I was hungrier to eat more  The service was not very good here  it appeared quite short staffed  We ate at Pier chic which was good but expensive  Pad Thai was again excellent  really good service  also expensive  Unfortunately we didn t have time to get to some of the other restaurants we would love to have gone to  The pool is lovely and the pool side bar really good also with very good service  We had been in tember before and didn t expect the amount of families that were staying at Al Qasr  It is an excellent place for families but not the best for couples seeking relaxation and a quiet time this time of year  This was our main problem with the hotel but that s not the hotel s fault  We were also a bit disappointed with our room service  while the rooms were very clean  little things like rubbish not being removed and not stocking up on used toiletries were unsatisfactory  The toiletries are one of the best things about the hotel but maybe they are getting a bit stingy with them   Or maybe it was just an oversight Overall despite having a lovely time  we weren t as impressed with Al Qasr as we expected  Our previous experience had  in our memory anyway  been flawless so it was always going to be difficult to live up the expectations  We would probably try someplace without so many families next time if travelling during school holiday time  I also hope the standards aren t beginning to slip a bit  
N =>   second to none service and hotel a hotel second to none  service began at the airport and finished their you cold not get any better from the meeting party to the hotle manager  money could nt buy any better service all were outstanding through our stay  the hotel restraunts pier chic  zen he and mj s were outstanding and nothing was to much trouble   st time in dubai and it wont be the last i wont look at any other hotel this was perfect  highly recomended 
N =>   Terrible Hotel     Star     Not a chance I stayed here in ust with my daughter on the way back from Thailand for   nights  I was really looking forward to it   How dissappointed we both were  Don t get me wrong  the pool is great and it s got good access to Jumeirah beach  Apart from that I would not rate it at all   and it certainly isn t a   star hotel  It looks very impressive  but the service was rubbish   Room not ready  room not cleaned on time  no fresh fruit in room  no ice in room and it was incredibly expensive   I would definitely not recommend it and I certainly would not go back   We heard that the hotel had sacked half it s staff since Xmas   it really showed  
N =>   Great hotel but shop around I loved this hotel  but when i was speaking to fellow guests i found out that by just booking on their website i was paying twice the price of others  Top quality hotel but check out prices before you book  
N =>   Soon to return We stayed at the Al Qasr Christmas       We had decided to get away and escape the cold of England for our  st Christmas away with our young family     year old son and daughter who had her  st birthday on the day we travelled home   Although we had been away with the children before we were still slightly apprehensive as to what Christmas in Dubai would be like  The Al Qasr did not disapoint  Check in was excellent  we had arrived on an early flight and where at the hotel by      and in our room by  am  This was very helpful as although our children has sleeped on the flight it was great to get them washed and changed and un packed  The facilities in the room for the children  toys  cot  and baby products was a really nice touch and appreciated  Much has been mentioned on Trip Advisor regarding the rooms  We found them to be spacious  clean and well equipped  We unfortunatly did not have a seaview room but the balcony looked over the lagoons and waterways at the rear of the hotel  These are fanatastic with the hotels abras making interesting viewing throughout the day as they glide past  The TV S are not flat screens but we did not find that this affected our holiday to any degree     The hotel grounds  gardens  pool areas  are far more important to us as a family than sitting in a room watching television  The pool areas are fantastic  The childrens club pool with its large sun shade over the water is great  and the quality and quantity of the life guards is exceptional  My only slight gripe regarding the pool area is the service at he pool bar  You could wait too long for a waiter to come around to the sun loungers to take a drinks order  In other hotels we have stayed at we find the staff can sometimes be too obtrusive  chasing a drinks order whilst your trying to relax and this can also be a negative  however the Al Qasr seem to have gone to far in the other direction  Regular  sweeps  of the pool area by discreet yet approachable waiters would be a bonus rather than waiting  or wandering to the bar to find somebody to take an order Holidaying with a young famiy we had booked the Half Board option and decided to eat in the main buffet restaurant   We found the choices available very good with enough variety to try something different each evening  Our children enjoyed their meals and the staff in the restaurant where  st class  very attentive and extremely polite  However be careful  we did not realise and where not informed untill checking out that our half board option  that we had pre booked in the UK  did not cover the evening buffets on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day  This was chargeable at and additional cost of nearly       We did manage through are travel agent to have this amount reimbursed  but felt that on a   night break to pay half board and then have to pay again for   of those nights was unjustified  However  we have booked again for this Christmas        and our staying longer  so it cannot have been that bad    We know that our half board will not apply to Christmas Eve Day and we accept that  now that we are forwarned  We are looking forward to another wonderful family holiday  Our children being older will be able to enjoy more of the facilities  especially the excellent Wild Wadi water park  and appreciate the Abras journeys around the hotel  We note that the Al Qasr is no longer No  on TA in Dubai  I do hope that we will not be disappointed  
N =>  Great Location Excellent Service  Location       Really impressive resort  Great beach  nice pools  cool water park and unbeatable view  given BaA  Rooms       Good layout  Very good AC  Super flat screen  with DVD   High speed internet  Great bed  Water  amp  fruits provided  Nothing to complain about Service       Impressed by staff  only check in and check out were not perfect    friendly  knowledgable and responsive Did not eat there  besides some snacks at the pool   So cannot judge food Overall       Was really impressed by hotel  Right now room rates are very fair  as it is very hot in Dubai   However  room rates seem to go up to     Euro per night during peak season  I do not know whether I would pay these rates  
N =>   Hit By the Financial Crisis Very Bad Experience  I used to agree with all the positive reviews here  Al Qasr was one of best choices in Dubai if I m travelling for leisure  It was a very disappointing visit  It doesn t reflect anymore the   stars standards of Jumeirah  Some of staff needs more training in Customer Care  some will not even smile at you if you asked them for anything  Rooms needs renovation  amp  maintenance  The Beautiful furniture was VERY Dusty so was the curtains    Bed linens needs to be changed as their colour turned to yellow    Room service cutlery full of scratches  amp  stains  I ordered once from the room service  amp  my dinner arrived on a stained table cloth     Air Conditioning was very very hot  amp  it was fixed only after calling Service one for the  th time in the second day       Although it has been reported from the first day  Walls definitely needs repainting  When I checked in the bathroom floor was not moped after the previous guest  amp  it was full of hair    which was really disgusting Restaurants Staff needs training in personal hygiene  amp  etiquette as I observe one of the staff was picking his nose  amp  directly after that touching the cutlery  amp  dishes on the table  amp  serving the tea                    Which kept me away from the restaurants I wrote this review for Al Qasr managment to see  amp  review their standards as it s getting lower than expected  
N =>  As good as ever Just returned from our annual half term trip to dubai  We have stayed at all the jumeirah properties and find them superb but the last   visits have stayed at the al qasr  I travelled with my   teenage sons and we all agree the hotel caters for all our needs  We always use the premium leisure facility which adds that extra bit of luxury  A wonderful property with excellent facilities and friendly staff giving first class service we can not wait to return  
N =>   Luxury personified Had a wonderful stay at al qasir got upgraded to the villas and what a pleasant surprise that was  felt like you had your own private pool  would recommend this hotel to everyone  having been on a virgin cruise in ch supposed to be to Dubai  but we were   hours outside  this hotel was so central for everything would go back there in a minute  great choice of restaurants too Chinese being our favourite There is so much staff there  they couldn t do enough for us  well done  
N =>  Honeymoon Stay   Mixed Experience Rooms Excellent Inconsistant Service I hope Stephan Schupbach reads this review as I d be keen for him to speak to him about our stay as we weren t given an opportunity on honeymoon This is a mixed review by all accounts  We stayed for   nights in a ior Suite at Al Qasr as part of our honeymoon We were met at the airport and within    mins were on our way to the hotel  fabulous Service and a super driver who told us all about Dubai We were met at the hotel entrance and taken straight up to the exec floor to check in  very good first impression It was only      am and we were told that our room wasn t available  which was understandable  but they would do everything they could to get us in a room asap as we d been travelling since  am the previous day We enjoyed a lovely breakfast on the terrace and sat back and relaxed At      am we were told that the room wouldn t be ready until lunchtime now as they were waiting for people to vacate the room  it was suggested that we go to the pool and they would ring us At this time I mentioned that when I booked the room it was stated to us that as it was our honeymoon we would be upgraded to an Ocean ior Suite or a better room for no charge  They said ok and they would get back to us We then arranged for our luggage to be brought up  got changed and went to the pool We relaxed by the pool and at       am we received a call to say a room was ready  We were delighted as we were so tired  keen to unpack and rest  We also had afternoon tea booked at the Burj and we needed to freshen up Our delight was short lived when we were told that If we wanted this room we would have to pay an additional     AED a night extra  I was really shocked and again reiterated that when I booked the room it was stated to us that as it was our honeymoon we would be upgraded for no charge  I was told rather bluntly this wasn t the case and I had to pay or I had to wait until an other room was available We decided to wait and was told to contact the executive floor after lunch We went up to the Executive floor at       and was told that they couldn t guarantee when the room would be ready but still offered us the better room for the extra     AED per night  I said I was disappointed that this had been offered to us  but was told that was it  not a great start to the honeymoon At       another person took over at the desk and came to tell us that the room would be free soon as the cleaners were in there preparing it  We sat back until       and then went to see the front desk to which another person had taken over  I told her what I had been told  which she looked very confused and said this wasn t the case  I asked her to ring housekeeping to check  She said she would     mins later she came back to us and said they were cleaning the room but that takes   hours and we would have to wait We waited in the Exec floor and at       we asked if our room was ready  the girl said it was and I asked why we hadn t been told she said it had just come free which I thought was odd That said the room was beautiful and was very luxurious having   large flat screen TV s and a Bose sound system We quickly unpacked  freshened up and went out On returning to the room  we found it to be overly hot  with an indicated   c on the air conditioning despite us setting it at   c  I rang the club floor and was told it would be sorted Nobody came out and we endured a very restless sticky night and on going for breakfast we mentioned the problem again  to which we were told it might or indeed has been sorted  I said it hadn t and they said it would be sorted today We went off to the Wild Wadi to enjoy the water park  which was complimentary  We entered the park and gave our room number and was told that we were not on their computer so clearly weren t Al Qasr guests and had to pay  I said we were guests and asked them to ring the hotel to confirm  they refused to do so and asked for us to pay the admission costs  I showed them our room keys and the supervisor came over and finally let us in  another example of poor service When we returned to the room it was lovely and cool and clearly the air con had been sorted I went back to the Executive club floor to thank them for sorting this out and also mentioned the problems at Wild Wadi which they didn t seem interested in but would mention the Wild Wadi people This was where I think there was a problem  there seemed to be a large number of people on the front desk of the Exec floor with different people changing every hour or so  There seemed only   person who I thought was befitting of an Exec floor  Kathryn I think her name was  she greeted us by name and came to chat to us and took a genuine interest in what we had done  she was very professional and offered to sort out reservations in the Burj for us The day before we were due to leave we booked our airport transfer for  am on the Tuesday morning  The girl on the Exec floor said it was all sorted and someone would be at our room at          am to collect our luggage and we could check out at     am in good time for our car On the Tuesday morning our luggage was not collected so at     am we headed with our bags to the Executive Floor which to our surprise was closed  we then headed off with our suitcases all the way to reception where we asked if we could check out  which we did  We then inquired as to what had happened with the Executive floor and why our baggage wasn t picked up to which he said I don t know it looked like nothing was booked We then asked him about our car  he looked very puzzled  then took us outside to speak with the concierge guys who told us that our car hadn t been booked Obviously this was a concern as we needed to check in before     am  The guys downstairs in reception seemed very embarrassed by this and apologised for it not been sorted  they then got us a car and finally we were on our way home This is where I ve found it difficult to sum up the hotel  we paid over       for   nights at the hotel  The room was luxurious  air con good when working and general staff  waiters and waitresses were very helpful and constantly chatted to us  However the hotel is charging prices and positioning itself at Four Seasons Level and in some areas its meeting this  mainly housekeeping  public areas  some staff  But where it matters in the public face of the hotel  i e  Club Executive Floor staff its far from meeting these standards  On our flight back we thought long and hard about whether to put these comments on trip advisor and we came to the conclusion that for the money we paid the Service was not up the required standard  We thought Dubai was magnificent and do plan to return but at the moment we won t be considering the Al Qasr  
N =>  Fantastic place Absolutely perfectfirst class in every way We arrived early and was met by very professional staff who showed us to the early arrival room where we were able to have a shower and change into pool wear and then we went off and enjoyed the facilities  The staff called us to our mobile as soon as the room was ready and when we went up to the room our cases had been delivered  We went with two other couples who had stayed in the hotel before and had told us how great the place is and we had read all of the reviews on trip advisor  Even so we could not believe how fantastic the whole place is  Food  staff  hotel facilities spa treatments  location ambience in fact everything about the whole place is top class  Its not cheap but its not expensive in comparison to other   star hotels in Dubai  we have stayed in dubai before and enjoyed it but would not have been in a big rush back had it not been for our friends had chosen the destination but I have to say already i am planning to return around the Christmas time with the family  Although we had no kids with us this time there was plenty for kids there and one of the things that impressed me the fact that there was ten lifegaurds at the pool and there was lifejackets available free of charge at the pool side  if you are thinking of going to Dubai in my opinion you will not find anywhere better  
N =>   Always delivers I can only agree with all the positive remarks already posted about this stunning hotel  I can t really add any further pluses  it s all been said This was our second stay at Al Qasr and was the second leg our honeymoon  having spent a few blissful days in Oman  This is my husband s favouite hotel in the world  having traveled extensively I just feel I should mention one thing however  despite the majority of the staff being fantastic and always willing to do anything for you  our only negative experience was at check in  with a female member of staff  can t remember her name  started with a  P    We arrived from Oman at  pm and were seated in the beautiful waiting area and offered drinks etc  But then  we were forgotten about  We were eventually told  whilst finally checking in  by this woman   rather rudely   almost an hour later  that our room was not ready  it was   pm by now and we were on our honeymoon   and were told to  wait   No offer of an apology  nothing really   we had to push her to give us a free  buffet  lunch  and she didn t even include drinks  Also  when we inquired about our  sirius  account  which is Jumeirah s loyalty system  we were told that there was no record of our account and despite having accrued a LOT of points during our previous stay  she made no effort no rectify the situation  She just wasn t interested   didn t even congratulate us on our recent nuptuals Anyway  this was the only negative of our otherwise lovely stay  but not expected for a couple arriving for their honeymoon  be I d been spoilt by the perfect service we received at Six Senses Hideaway Zighy Bay  Oman  which was truly  truly amazing in each and every way  
N =>  Everything about it blew me away    My husband and I stayed here for   nights in       as part of our honeymoonl  Dubai being my husbands choice for a destination  I tend to appreciate hotels that are built on a more intimate scale  however I was truly amazed by this place from start to finish  Everything about the hotel is out of this world and seems worthy of a photograph  You will never walk past a member of staff  no matter their job  who will not stop what they re doing to smile and give a polite  quot hello  quot  We were upgraded to business class due to staying for the   nights  which meant we had access to the business lounge  We wished we had made more use  especially for the lunch and the evening drinks inc cocktails  but as our time was limited we only managed a couple of visits  The grounds are truly awesome although I d say they ve gone a little overboard on the lifeguards  there must be one every   meters apart  which leaves you feeling a little too watched  We found the beach a better option and you are so looked after with free ice lollys  evian face spray  cold towels   they even offer to clean your sunglasses  The water s a gorgeous blue colour and with so much salt it s impossible to sink in  but it can be a bit stingy on the eyes  Dubai is an expensive place so be prepared to spend money and there seems to be no in between when it comes to shops  they are either luxury boutiques or cheap markets  That being said  the shopping centres are well worth a visit  I was a bit dissapointed with the hotel souk market as everything was very expensive and I love nothing more than wandering around markets in search of a bargain  I d recommend the bus tour  excellent for getting around and seeing all the sights  and you can jump on and off as you like  We also had free tickets for the Wadi Water park which was great fun  If you are due to stay at this hotel you will not be dissappointed    
N =>  Amazing hotelterrible restaurants in the complexnot impressed by Dubai We spent a couple of nights at this hotel after   nights at the Ritz Carlton  In terms of service and ambiance the Ritz Carlton is like an overpriced Motel   compared to this place We should have stayed here in first place  No matter how big disneyzed vegasized sanityzed the place is this hotel offers an impeccable service  Of course for     Euro per night it better be  Everyone was courteous and ready to help except for the bell people wich were just hustling for tips  Check in was a breeze and we were escorted to our room by a very smiley hostess  Rooms are a bit on the arabic style but you get used to it Just one thing was bad in the Madinat Jumeriah complex   restaurants  We hate in several of them even before we stayed here and each one of them has been a total disappointment  Lousy food at best sort of pricey too All in all a great hotel experience and it is worth to fly all the way down here just to stay at this hotel  I did nt really feel the  quot Dubai thing quot  everyone talks about nowday  Beside shopping and chillin  at your hotel pool there s not that much to do or to be wowed about in this place  
N =>   Splendid Splendour Where do we start  We had four nights at Al Qasr in ust    and what a fabulous experience  We booked a private transfer from the airport through the hotel   they met us as soon as we got off the plane  guided us through passport control and customs and waited patiently for our bags to arrive  before driving us to the hotel in a beautiful Lexus  with complimentary chilled face towels and iced water  We arrived around     am  very tired  and were whisked straight to our amazing room for in room check in  while the porter dealt with our bags  We had ordered a king bed but there were two singles in the room  although they were almost as big as doubles    The delightful lady who was checking us in offered to move us but advised that we had would not have as nice a view if we did  We decided to stay and within a couple of minutes two staff had appeared and proceeded to push the beds together and remake them  Even pushed together they were still one of the most comfortable beds we ve ever experienced  The outlook from the Ocean View rooms is break taking  with the Burj al Arab peeking around the corner  The rooms are beautifully appointed and the toiletries in the luxurious bathrooms are heavenly  I have to confess to still be using the lovely body lotion  The hotel itself is stunning and the staff can not do enough for you  We spent days by the huge pool  afternoons in the Al Fayrooz lounge  and evenings in Koubba bar enjoying some delicious cocktails  The complimentary golf carts that run up and down the private beach are wonderful   they go all the way from Al Qasr to the Burj al Arab and Wild Wadi and save too much walking in the Dubai heat  entry to Wild Wadi was free to guests of Jumeriah properties   The only thing we would do differently would be to get breakfast included in our room tariff if possible   like all hotel breakfasts it is very expensive  but the food is really lovely and there is plenty of variety  We have since been told that the room service breakfast is excellent as well  You really are spoilt for choice with restaurants in the Al Qasr Souk Mina a Salam complex  Most can be on the pricey side  but with the free shuttle bus running backwards and forwards between the Mall of the Emirates you can find cheaper food options quite easily  Our whole experience at Al Qasr was nothing short of magical  Sure we paid for it  and its not cheap  but we really believe it was worth every penny  We can t wait to go back  
N =>   Amazing service   Just got back from   nights at Al Qsar  We were recommended by friends to book an Executive room   well worth the extra  We had    hour access to the Executive Club Lounge where the service was impeccable  Breakfast  afternoon tea and Happy Hour gave us all the food and drink we needed and was included in the room price  The Executive Lounge staff were incredibly efficient and effective  they booked all our tours for us  consistently had a  can do   and did  attitude  nothing was too much trouble for them There was nothing to fault in this hotel throughout  It s a big resort but if we needed to ask directions  whoever we asked took us to where we wanted to be All the staff seem to be given a good deal of autonomy so they can make decisions on the spot  We were there in Ramadan but it caused us little disruption  The West could learn a lot from this hotel and its staff  
N =>   Just impeccable   My husband and I stayed at the Al Qasr for   nights just a few days ago  I don t want to say many things because words are unnecessary when you have to do with a hotel of this status  Impeccable surroundings and location  impeccable service  you had everything without even having to ask for it   Everything was magical   If you plan to go to Dubai and you can afford this hotel  don t even bother to look elsewhere   you ll just feel like arabian royalty   DO NOT MISS IT    
N =>  out of this world      loved it loved it loved it     We stayed at the Al Qasr for   weeks for our honeymoon  When our transfer pulled up outside the gates they were big gold horse statues leading up to the building  I was in ore  It was ike something out of a fairy tale book  it was very posh and the heat outside was hot  bearing in mind it was midnight Which was a bit worrying to what heat it would be during the day With it being our honeymon they left some very posh chocolates and some strawberries dipped in chocolate  in our room along side a bottle of champagne  The day after we got a vase full of roses left on the table with a personalised card to congratulate us on our marriage Every night whilst we were there they left an animal on our bed that was made up of towels  along with some freebies  Each night we got either coconut lip balms or walnut body scrubs  lavender massage oil  foot sprays  hand foot lotions  or a posh choc each on our pillow The food is wonderful no matter where you eat in the jumeriah resort  we tried loads of restaurants and they were all lovely  But our favorite being the  Meat Company   This was beacause it was more layed back and the best steak we ve ever eaten  The heat whilst we were there was in between         degrees C  The hotel is lovely and cool due to the air con Whilst on the beach or by the pool waiters try to make you feel comfy in the strong heat by coming round with cold towels  free ice lollies  fruit  and offer to spray your face with evian water  You literally dont have to move if you dont want because they come round and offer to clean your sun glasses as well  We felt like royalty on our stay there  This hotel is absolutely amazing and did not disappoint us once  not even slightly If you want to go somewhere special  or you are considering booking this hotel then do so without a moments thought  We will be returning sometime soon I wanna go back now       
N =>   Terrible Experience My husband and I arrived at Al Qasr on  th e and were to check out and depart on   e from Al Qasr at Madinat Jumeirah  Dubai on an Emirates flight to Paris scheduled for      hrs  In order to save time in the early morning before our scheduled departure from the hotel  we completed check out formalities and settled our hotel bill just before midnight on   e       We also requested a wake up call at      am the following morning as we had an Emirates limousine scheduled to pick us up from Al Qasr at      am for our      am flight  as we had already completed the online check in procedure  we were required to arrive at the airport    mins before departure   We promptly received our wake up call from the hotel staff at      am as requested and waited patiently in our room till      am for a call from the hotel staff to announce the arrival of our pick up and finally called Emirates to find out why the car had not yet arrived  We waited another   mins on the phone till the Emirates representative made inquiries about our scheduled pick up and came back on the line to inform us that the limousine had in fact arrived at the hotel as scheduled at      am and that the driver had also requested the concierge on duty to inform us of the arrival of our Emirates pick up  Unfortunately  the concierge a gentleman by the name of Mr  Rauf refused to inform us about the arrival of the car and told the driver that he was not allowed to disturb his guests at that hour and therefore sent the driver away  The driver left the premises and reported the incident to Emirates airline  making sure to mention the name of Mr  Rauf for the record We immediately called Service One from our room to inform them of the incident and asked for Mr  Rauf to ask him why he had done such a ridiculous thing  As we were already late for our flight  I told Mr  Rauf to meet me downstairs  Upon meeting Mr  Rauf at the entrance of the hotel and demanding an explanation for his actions  we were treated with complete indifference and not even given an apology  We also asked how he could do such a thing when we had asked for a wake up call from the hotel at      am  to which he shrugged and mumbled something about not being able to trace the wake up call  To make things worse  he did not even have the courtesy to arrange for a complementary airport transfer for us considering it was clearly his fault that the limousine had left without us  He asked the doorman to get us a taxi for the airport for which we ended up paying Dhs    upon reaching the airport Needless to say  the experience has been shocking and pathetic coming from a hotel of it s repute and will prevent us from ever returning at any of the Jumeirah properties  The unprofessional behavior of Mr  Rauf indicates a serious deficiency in the training of the hotel personnel and even a lack of common sense amongst it s employees  I believe that if a prestigious hotel like Al Qasr is unable to meet such basic expectations of it s guests  that even a   star property would definitely see to  it is simply not worthy of it s reputation and definitely not worth paying big buck for  
N =>   Fantastic  We stayed at Al Qasr in       for our   th wedding anniversary It was fantastic We arrived after a   hour flight at approx  am we were taken to a private check in area and given cool towels and arabian coffee  an aquired taste  We were lucky our room was ready to check and was amazing Huge bed  fab furniture loads of space Bathroom was great sep shower large bath and plenty of luxurious toiletries  replenished daily  Housekeeping and turndown service every day Chocolates on pillows bottled mineral water and towels in the shape of animals Tea fresh filter coffee making facilities We stayed half board and would definately recommend this although book your tables well in advance Some restaurants were excluded but you could eat at lunchtime in lieu of this Breakfast is amazing  every food imaginable Egg station  smoothie bar sushi cooked breakfasts waffles cereals fresh yoghurt bar fruit cheeses cooked meats and much much more   One of our favourite restaurant was pierchic at the end of the wooden pier jambase great funky atmosphere chinese restaurant very good our least favourite was Pisces in the souk area A bit stuck up to be honest ordered   different bottles of wine non of which were available think this may have been deliberate to get the expensive ones sold Great food but atmosphere lacking Pools great  towels laid out fresh fruit lollipops and ices free of charge Took a golf buggy ride to the Burj Al Arab but best to go after   pm free to residents of AQ Went to the     bar which was great golf buggy will take you there also A good selection of shops in the Souk The staff throughout are amazing very attentative  but not too much so Apparently they have a ratio of   members of staff to every guest which certainly seemed accurate Going back again later this year it is worth every penny my favourite place on earth  
N =>   our amazing honeymoon  we spent the last   days of our honeymoon at al qasr in dubai after an absolutely brilliant time spent in the maldives  we arrived in dubai to be taken by chauffeur to al qasr which was so handy and a great experience  on arrival at al qasr we were breathtaken by the sheer expanse of the hotel and the opulence of it all  the hotel is so grand  and the decor very much in keeping with the arabian theme  we were upgraded to a summer house   dar al masjaf which was absolutely fantastic as we were supposed to be staying in the main hotel  our villa was wonderful  with our own butler service  the abra boats picking us up right outside our villa and the buggys coming right to our front door  the pool which we were sharing with   other villas was mostly empty so we had it to ourselves  the lifeguards on duty here all day long must get very bored  we were impressed with every aspect of this hotel  the souk was wonderufl with    restaurants to choose from  we were not disappointed and found the food to be affordable  the breakfasts were very impressive  with sooo much choice  you can see the burj al arab from al qasr  tho be warned you cant get inside without wearing smart clothing  flowery shorts arent allowed as we discovered to our dismay  we went to the mall of the emirates  a bus picks u up from the hotel  and we did the sundowner desert safari which was a gr  experience  they take you to an arabic camp in the middle of the desert and give a gr  buffet  free henna tatoos and a bellydancer  it was a lovely night out  the jeep lets down the tyres and flies through the sand dunes  its great fun  we loved this hotel  we however found dubai creek and downtown dubai to be a little daunting and found ourselves lost and not able to find our way  the gold souks they talk about were most disappointing to us and appeared more like a jumble sale than anything else  al qasr is a most distinguished  opulent and relaxing hotel  the like of which we will probably never stay in again  we would highly recommend the summer vialls as they are so private and the bathrooms are massive  the beds are so comfy and theres   different types of pillow to choose from  the rooms are very clean  we would definitely recommend al qasr  
N =>   Wow Wow Wow    We stayed at the Al Qasr for our honeymoon last ust  The whole experience was out of this world from the moment we were picked up in our own car from the airport  little tip  when the driver offers you his hand he s not just being friendly   he wants a tip   It is hard to describe just how amazing the complex is  Everything is so big and luxrious we couldn t complain about anything  except maybe having to wait a few hours for our room after a tiring flight  but even then we were given free food and drink and use of a room we could change in so that we could get to the pool The service at Al Qasr was superb  we were treated like royalty by everyone from security to pool attendants  Everybody says hello and has a smile even if they are working outside in the     degree heat We looked forward to returning to our room every night to see what treats had been left by housekeeping   anything from chocolates to an Elephant made out of towels  fantastic   There are so many restaurants and bars in the complex that we only ate elsewhere twice and that was with local friends  They also joined us for brunch at Mina A Salam and said it was the best in Dubai    P   brasserie in Pisces  in the souk was one of our favourite restaurants Had tea at the Burj  which was a great way to get in and see such an amazing hotel without breaking the bank  And there was a really relaxed atmosphere which suprised us Without a doubt the most luxurious  perfect holiday  Can t wait to return  
N =>   Simply Wonderful This trip was a   th Birthday treat for my husband and myself and wow what a wonderful hotel to spend it in  What can I say that has not already been said  Grounds   beautiful  Staff   nothing is too much trouble  Food   delicious    Just perfect  We were totally impressed by the personal touch considering the sheer size of the operation  We upgraded to Premium Leisure which was well worth the additional cost  Must mention Naleem from PLC who was absolutely charming  Also Ella who was just wonderful with my   year old  I have never felt so relaxed and safe in a foreign country  Would return in a heart beat  Thank you to all members of staff from top to bottom who were just so polite and welcoming  
N =>   Perfection Been going to this resort for over six years  working our way down from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  now full of  quot football shirts unfortunately  So dont go there  unless you like footbal  quot  The Al Qasr  amp  where we stayed in the Dal a Masyaf villas are simply perfect  been there four times this year alone Staff retention is excellent as they all sign a two year contact  so going back everytime is like going home  amp  being amongst friends  Who take the genuienly personal pride  From the house keeper maid to the beach  amp  pool side staff to the guys attending to the gardens  They are actually stop work as you walk by so as not to inconvience you  amp  greet you again genuienly  Not an  quot American smile quot   amp  courtesy but a want to please  They are programmed never to say No to a guests query but to seek an alternative  how refreshing If you got kids then you will never been feel so comfortable  amp  reassured the baby sitting services are outstanding and very reasonably priced  Safety is paramount  a Lifeguard every   yards around the pool  amp  not a spotty teenager a real trained lifeguard we have at times ventured away from Dubai  to  star in Portugal  amp  the Forte in Sardinia  amp  the Caribbean  but always regretted it  Pound for Pound there is nowhere else in the world that for the money you can experience true   star living We have at times had problems of course but so so small in any other resort you would not dare to complain   amp  if there is a difficulty it is resolved immediatly  I mean immediatly  You need extra pillows    minutes from the call to house keeping they were delivered  need extra towels or room made up at        again   minutes  Nothing is to small a request  they run out of baby chairs on Xmas day due to the number of babies  the manager came over to personally to apoligise  the next day they had purchased   brand new top of the range chairs  amp  would not release them until we came to breakfast to demonstate their care You can tell how much we think of this resort  amp  above all there whole ethos   very English orientated  amp  educated We have seen the same people holidaying year after year who like us return for all the reasons and always find the quality exceptional I would add that from the months of june through to ust it is exceptionally hot and would not reccomend taking very young children babies Please go it is an experience out of this world not to be missed and you will never want to go anywhere else its truly amazing  
N =>   Gorgeous upscale resort   didn t want to leave  We absolutely loved this hotel to death  We booked the premium club package with Mina Al Salam first  but received an upgrade by surprise  and it was such a good surprise  too Breakfast was very well done   lots to choose from at the buffet  from fruits  to pastries  to hot food and juices  As was afternoon tea and pre dinner canapes  which were enough to fill you up for dinner  The staff were very attentive  and even took note that it was our anniversary  That even filtered through to the restaurant  Pierchic  who provided us a chocolate mousse cake to celebrate The resort is just so lovely  You have unlimited access to the golf buggies  canal boats  private beach  resort pool  etc  And plenty of entertainment around to keep anyone amused  Our room was very spacious   I loved the   x queen size beds next to each other  And the bathroom had lots of room  Interior wasn t tacky at all  It s actually quite tasteful  something I would love for my own bedroom  We had an issue after we checked out  as technically we were still considered guests for that day  But one of the guards by the boat stations wouldn t let us on  as our name was not on the list that was provided in the morning  As soon as we complained  the day manager apologised and provided us a Bentley on our transfer back to the airport  Otherwise  we had such a great time  and would have loved to stay there for at least an extra week  
N =>   al Quasr we stayed at the al qasr in july i think and had a wonderful time after staying at la royal meridian the previous year which was also excellent We booked the hotel with the premium club etc but to be honest we just had a bad time  the limo never arrived so we had to pay for a taxi ourselves which was refunded at the end of our stay the hotel blamed our travel agent which we don t believe after all if you book premium then it is normal for free limo transfers from the airportalso the staff turnover in this hotel is unbelievable hardly any body from   months before  the russian lady in the premium lounge was rude and ignorant  she only seem to care about our german russian fellow guests the other staff in the premium lounge could nt do enough and they said they had other guests complaining about her  Anyway dubai is great but never go back to this hotel move on try some where different For Us the THE MAGIC HAD GONE VERY SAD TO REPORT   
N =>  A very special hotel on Jumeira beach  We booked our   night holiday with Trailfinders  which offered us the best price compared to everyone else including the hotel itself  we also got much higher quotes from Kuoni  Thomas Cook and Premiere   We were a bit concerned before travelling as we were going to Dubai over the Ramadan period  but we needn t have worried  The only differences were lack of live music and no alcoholic drinks before  pm We chose to upgrade to Premium Leisure  which included airport pickups in a nice limo and access to the Premium Leisure and Executive Lounges  Our room was very spacious and nicely decorated  The bed consisted of two double beds pushed together  but there wasn t a gap between them  so it felt like one huge bed  The bathroom had two sinks  a deep bath  a large shower area and a separate toilet   bidet room  The shower pressure was the best I have ever tried  but we did notice slight temperate fluctuations  The room included every amenity you could possibly want  except Wi Fi and CD DVD player  Internet access was available in the room  but not free  They even provided beach bags I would recommend an upgrade to Premium Leisure as it gives free access to a happy hour between    pm        pm during Ramadan   We spent almost every night there drinking champagne  Pommery  and eating very nice canap s The beach was great and lounges were very comfortable  Beach staff went around offering sorbet  fruit and cold towels every couple of hours  Service everywhere was fantastic  Staff didn t hang around waiting for tips  which can be quite annoying in some resorts  especially in the Caribbean   However  they all work very hard and definitely deserve them Food and drink Alcoholic drinks are quite expensive  the cheapest bottle of wine about      Breakfast at the Exec Lounge   great  good choice and service Trader s Vic   cocktails were pretty good but food was extremely disappointing Japengo   probably the worst plate of sashimi that I have ever had  but other dishes looked nice Meat Company   highly recommend  but book in advance The Wharf   disappointing food and service was very slow The Mall of Emirates is huge and only about   minutes away  The hotel provides free shuttles that leave every hour  but a taxi ride cost us only     The Mall is open until  am  Tip   ask at the Club Lounge whether you are entitled to free tickets to Wild Wadi  I think it s about     each otherwise   
N =>   fab fab fab love this hotel agree with all other positive reviews staff and service excellent  rooms lovely  anything from housekeeping delivered before replacing phone  special mention to hard working boys first floor premium club could not have looked after us any better  recommend MJ restaurant  only complaint weather in tember to hot think if Al Qasr had a direct line to God this would have been sorted also  
N =>   Another brilliant stay at Al Qasr Our second visit to Al Qasr was just as good as the first  I much prefer it to other hotels which are ranked higher  It has a large pool  good beach access and helpful  friendly staff  As return visitors we were given an upgraded room  We paid for the club executive option which is excellent value for money  
N =>  Awesome  Met in airport and driven in limo to hotel  a good start  A warm welcome and excellent check in  Wonderful incense aroma as you walk in to the palatial entrance  Everyone working in the hotel would acknowledge you whenever they walked past  all very friendly and wanting to help  We stayed at the Jumeirah Beach last year but preferred Al Qasr Trying to book up again as I d like longer than a week this time  Shuttle bus to the shopping mall every hour  and also to the Gold Souk a couple of times a week  We went to the beach every day and had complimentary ice lollies  fruit  cold towels  evian water spray  Complete and utter luxury  
N =>   Al Qasr for the win  My wife and I headed to Al Qasr after staying at the Burj for two nights  To follow my other review s format  I ll give my brief opinion review  For the money  it s worth it  It felt very comfortable and the staff was excellent  I liked that we could walk to the Madinate Jumeierah  quot souk quot  and shop around or eat  Also  the pool was cozy and the beach was right in back  All in all  very good  I know that other reviewers have stated opinions about the staff  but we found them to be just like anywhere else  No scared looks  no unprofessionalism  Good stuff The full review The ride up the road to Al Qasr is interesting  There are about    bronze    horses in various poses up the center median to the front door  Also  in the center of the courtyard there is a nice horse head fountain  One of our taxi drivers made fun of the bronze horses in his broken English which my wife and I found very entertaining   We arrived and were taken to the lobby to try some dates and Arabic coffee  I didn t want any coffee  but Mohommed  the host  talked my wife into it  He was very kind and had a great big smile  really made us feel welcome We paid for the hotel  I was given the choice to upgrade  which seemed appropriate because it included breakfasts and a ride to the airport as well as executive lounge access  never used the exec lounge  though  and were taken to our rooms by Mohammed  My only negative opinion was that our rooms for so far  It was kind of annoying if we forgot anything in our room because it was so far The room was elegant  but certainly looked a lot less spectacular than the Burj  but we expected that feeling  The tv was small  which I found odd  but other than that nothing too awful  The bathroom was large and had a nice tub and shower  There was a camel cookie waiting for us when we arrived and it looked like a  rd grader baked and decorated it  a little tacky  but a cute gesture  I suppose There was a shuttle bus to the Mall of the Emirates that left every    minutes that was very convenient  Also  if we needed a taxi  the entourage outside the front door were very accomodating The price was so much less expensive than the Burj  so I may have liked it more because of that  but I m not sure  It was a good experience and I d recommend it  
N =>  Just Superb  An absolutely beautiful hotel that defies words  We had the basic Arabian room and it was fantastic and would have been more like an upgrade room anywhere else  Our balcony looked over the sea to the left  the waterways and abras in front and the Burj al Arab to the right Spectacular My only gripe is that I feel you are graded into the have and have nots by what you want to spend on things and whether you refuse to pay for an upgrade on arrival  Also I booked direct with Jumeirah and had to only give a credit card number to hold the booking till our departure  I wanted to pay the bill in cash debit card but on arrival was told that not only would the full room rate be held straight away from my debit account but also a daily allowance as we had no breakfast included in the room rate or any other meals  So not only did they put a stop on my account fot the   night stay but also   days daily allowance irrespective of the fact that I had no intention of eating morning noon and night in the hotel  This was held on my account until checkout when I settled my bill just for the   night stay  Ican understand them being cautious that you may leave the hotel without the means to pay but we all don t have unlimited bank accounts and stay at their hotels as a treat All in all a wonderful stay  the only problem being that when you then move on to another hotel  as we did to the Jebel Ali   the Al Qasr is in a different league  
N =>   paradise just returned from the al qsar we will never forget the experience we had staying in this hotel the staff treat you as if you are royalty nothing is to much trouble the food was fantastic and plenty of choice there are a range of restaurants around the resort which cater for all the hotel is exceptionally clean the rooms are to die for the bed is fantastic we went there for our   th wedding anniversary and we feel as if we have had a holiday of a lifetime one which will be very hard to beat if you are thinking of booking this hotel think no more just do it you will not regret it we find it hard to believe that anyone could give this hotel a bad review  hopefully we will return to dubai and when we do we will be returning to the al qsar 
N =>   Awesome Hotel Everywhere I go  I always use trip advisor to find out useful facts on the destination I am heading to  Usually even the most stunning hotels in the world have poor reviews witten about them which can be really worrying when you have spent a lot of money on somewhere  Al Qasr Madinat is no different The Al Qasr is a hotel in the Madinat Jumeirah complex which is made up of   hotels all styled slightly differently  Next to the complex is the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  the Burj Al Arab and the Wild Wadi water park  All of the above can be reached by the excellent buggy service that operates round the whole place  The Madinat complex is also circled by a beautiful moat which you can be taken around by boat to restaurants or just to take a tour round Huge tip If you book a club level room  you get a transfer in a luxury car included in the cost of your stay  We didnt book the club level room but I paid for us to be collected by their transfer  It was AED      about    quid  for this service  It isnt just the car you are paying for  as you get off the plane and head towards passport control you are met by a Jumeirah host  whisked through a seperate passport control so you dont have to queue  we were even prioritised ahead of First class passenegers   The drive is about         minutes  Basically well worth     as it made a great start to our holiday as we were treated like royalty from that moment  Also because its a hotel transfer  they are expecting you when the car arrives and we were called by name from the moment we stepped out of the car Another VERY important tip  You need to book your restaurants the day before to make sure you get in  Make sure you email them to book your first evenings restaurant before you go  maybe even the second night too  The only one you can get away with turning up at without a booking is the main buffet restaurant but even there you could have to wait We arrived about midnight and the check in process was totally painless and the guy who took us to our room gave us all sorts of useful info on the way Our room was stunning  We had an Ocean view De luxe room  Well worth the bit extra over an Arabian De luxe for the view Havinng spent time in various fantastic hotels around the world  Europe  USA  Australia  Mauritius  Singapore etc  this hotel is probably my new favourite ever hotel I can understand the disney type comments  in fact i found that the grand oppulence of the place reminded my a little of Las Vegas  and I dont mean that in a bad way I just mean that absolutely everything has been thought of and designed into this place  I cant stress how fantastic it is If you are after a historical representation of Dubai then I guess this hotel wont suit you but if you just want a stunning   star resort to relax and be treated like stars then this is the place We ate in the Pier Chic  Pricey but very nice  The Chinese was probably our nicest meal  We also ate in the Italian and the main Buffet restaurant  which were great too  Wine pushes the cost of the meals up  In Pier Chic  our meal was about      a head but the wine i ordered was close to       for a wine that would have been about     in a UK restaurant   In the Italian our meal was about     a head      in the chinese and probably about     in the buffet restaurant  i didnt have a bottle of wine in the last one  We went to the Gold Souk  you are hassled a lot by people trying to flog you fake watches and bags and although nothing happened  I felt myself cluthing my camera and wallet very tightly there  Unless you intend to actually buy jewellery I would give it a miss Take a trip round the Burj  what a place   Best time to go is around     pm as you can have a look in the   th floor restaurant and the ground floor one with the huge fish tank If you are going with kids I would suggest the Jumeriah Beach hotel  Again a fantastic place but probably more a family hotel  The Al Qasr is more aimed at couples but thats not to say you couldnt take kids there If any other reviews have put you off  Ignore them and go   go  go  We spent half our time there wondering how people could not say anything other than great things about it Our   nights cost about      for the accomodation and our room bill at the end inculding all meals  drinks and whatever else we charged to the room was probably another          k  I had taken      in cash with me aswell but hardly used any I want to go on and on about it but will probably bore you  I think you get the picture I rarely say I will go back somewhere as there are just too many other places to go  but I will deffo be going back here at some point  No question  
N =>  Unfortunatly not that good Now don t get me wrong the place is good allright   it s just not very good or anything like  quot historic quot    Michael Winner would say      To avoid the booking problems some reviewers wrote about we booked all restaurants in advance   and that was very clever  thanks for that advice       because all the places are fully booked all the time      Sum up a few points    Food  Ate at Pierchic   good  by far most upmarket place in  quot town quot   but very   and i mean really expensive     Kids     grown ups  btw they do not allow kids  lt     since we left anyway        bottles of wine  average stuff though      Euros     Steak place  former Napa    lots of chi chi  you can choose your type of knife btw     lots of sauces and stuff      but the actual steak quality below average   on the though side        not done the way ordered     Wharf at Mina Salam       realy bad    food like NHS run hospital     brrrrr      Thai place actually pretty good   nice staff   caring attentative   and wok dishes excellent   but again be prepared for something like    Euros main course      La Peligrina  or something like that    Mexican place at Jumm  Beach hotel   lots of Meat   better then Steak house in Al Qasr but nothing special     cheaper though      great view on the   th floor     So you see overall not bad   but absolutly overpriced at least for Euro Land      do not expect Michelin star food no where     Room   had Superior Sea View Room   good  huge bed   small balcony    good vista      nice bathroom   that was   star Ok   but not stunning     Staff   well they seem to run on  quot full auto quot  if you get my drift     everything done by the book       but do not expect anything out of the routine thing     i did read the reviews prior to our booking and many times came across    quot treated like royalty   quot   i d say if Queens folk would be treated like that i guess   lots of monchars would be sorry for the job       we were in their Premium leasure Club programm   but this made no difference at all       the staff is allright but without beeing negative to our eastern european partner countries at all       of the girls and guys can not speak proper english and you can sense that their whole behaviour is one of  quot fear of doing something wrong quot  and therefore beeing subject of dressing down lecture  or even worse      so the  quot vibes quot  coming across from the people is not making yourself feeling too relaxed        i am struggeling for words here    but it s just missing  quot happy mood quot  i guess     Pool and beach   OK     but as many of the reviewers mentioned allready having    lifeguards covering the main pool is very   very OTT   they just stand around like Bhuddas and actually contribute to the strange feeling one might have allready       Nice beach tents though       and lods of sun loungers so no need to do the  quot german excercise quot  in the morning     Gym at Mina Salam   equipment very good  no technogym treadmills though    but no view on beach sea or anything it s an indoor job     I guess to summerize   the place is OK for a   star operation    t s just a bit Disneyland  does anybody remember the movie  quot futureworld quot    that would fit even better      nothing s real be it food staff Abras type boats     and it s by all means not an  quot unforgetable quot  experience      well maybe the bill is      
N =>  Exceptional hotel but booking facilities a pain As we had our teenage children there were   of us so we booked a Chrysler van pick up from the airport via the hotel which worked well and was reasonably priced  The check in couldn t have been easier  we were taken to our rooms and completed the paperwork there with no delay whatsoever Our   rooms were of very good quality with all of the facilities we needed  We had breakfast every day in the hotel in the Arboretum where there was a huge choice from English breakfast to Sushi We spent most of our days just lounging by the pool area where the staff were very helpful and there was no difficulty finding loungers  Previous reviews have commented on the over supply of lifeguards and it was quite amusing with a lifeguard every    feet around the pool you almost felt that if you took a poor stroke they would dive in to assist We ate at the lebanese restaurant in the Souk which was good  My major criticism is the nightmare of getting a restuarant reservation in the hotel  or booking anything else   We eventualy ate at the Wharf  a little ordinary  and at Pierchic  which was very good   However this was after numerous attempts to book both    and    hours ahead to be told that we should have booked a week ahead when we were still in London  It took a complaint to the head Concierge to get us in to the restaurants  In the case of the Wharf i simply can t understand why we were originally told it was full as there were at least   spare tables all the time we were there  We wanted to go to the Meat Co but the only way of doing it as all tables were booked was to take the risk as a walk in but we preferred the certainty of a reservation and gave up My wife did want to try the spa but again were told that nothing was available at any time   days ahead and that most guests were return bookers who had the foresight to make their reservations some weeks ahead The most amazing thing was the sheer dominance of the Russian guests at least     of those present seemed to be Russian of course i have no objection to that it s just quite noticeable We went to the gold souk  as everyone says the traffic is a nightmare taking almost an hour to get there at  pm  That night we ate at the revolving restauant in the Hyatt Regency which gives some exceptional views of the Creek area and the traffic jams below  It has a fixed price buffet which had a huge choice  One interesting experience whilst my wife shopped in the Mall of the Emirates  prices higher than in London  was to try the attached ski run I think it s     metres long and is a good way to spend an hour and get out of the shopping experience   
N =>  Arabian Paradise I was surprised by my boyfriend with a   day break to Dubai in ust       I had no idea where i was staying  what area and especially what hotel  We pulled up at this striking hotel and it just takes you in  Staff treat you like royalty when you arrive  and check in is like no other hotel ever  Even after that  you never have to look for more than   seconds to find a memeber of staff that is more than willing to help you out  The decor was all Arabian themed  as this is something my boyfriend wanted  and it was breathtaking  completely astounding  Even more amazing when you go outside is your method of transport around the complex   boats  or Abra s  around a man made lagoon that spans the entire hotel with water sucked in and recycled straight from the sea  Add to this the most amazing rooms   bathrooms  private beautiful beach  Service to match no other hotel i have ever been in  An even more magical holiday as i got proposed to and have already decided that i will be going back to Dubai and to the Al Qasr for part of my honeymoon  This was a trip of a lifetime and i will never forget it  Thank you to the staff of the Al Qasr for making this trip amazing  and i know my fiance is very grateful for all their help in arranging the night he proposed  Can t wait to return in       
N =>   Dubai   Too Busy for its own good  We honeymooned at the Al Qasr in ember   we spent   nights at the Al Husn Oman  separate review  and then flew to Dubai for our final   nights We stayed at the Mina Salaam   years ago as the resort first opened and were so impressed that we decided to head back for part of our honeymoon and stay at the slightly more expensive Al Qasr  Our transfer from the airport was amusing to say the least  although I do stress this was nothing to do with the hotel  our driver seemed to think we would be able to pick him out in the car park amongst all the other     white cars that were there   he then took us to the Souk next to the hotel and told us this was were he had been told to drop us   we explained that we were staying at the Al Qasr to which he got a bit irate and made a phonecall complaining to his boss yelling at him that he was told to drop us there and not the Al Qasr   good start The Al Qasr reception was packed and chaotic  nothing like the traquility of the Al Husn    we were shoved in a corned and after about    minutes were told our room wouldn t be ready until at least     pm  it was now      pm  we were told we could freshen up if we so wanted and were asked for a mobile number and told we would be contacted when the room was ready and basically just left  We were not even offered a cool drink or anything after our journey  which we had been in the same situation at the Mina Salaam   years prior and in the Al Husn   We wandered off and went for a bite to eat in which the service was slow   we waited about    minutes for our drinks to arrive   not a good start for a place that rates itself on quality of service  About      we received a call that our room was ready   we wandered up to reception  which takes a little while  only to be met with blank faces and shoved in yet another corner   at which point we were told we had been upgraded to a summer villa in the Dar As Masyaf  Another    minute wait and someone finally came to take us to our room   the room villa itself was lovely but very cut off   can only be accessed really by buggy or Abra  The    hour porters were helpful but they were needed to change money and book restaurants etc as it took a good    minutes to get to the reception area from where we were  The room was a good size but there wasn t realy any privacy   the Abra s were constantly going past the balcony and we also faced a main road although blocked off by shrubbery it was like sitting on the M    as a free upgrade it was OK but if we had of paid full price for the villa I would have been very disappointed  We ate the first night in the Whart restaurant situated at the Mina Salam   the food was excellent but the service was absoutely dire   we were taken to our table where we sat for    minutes at which point I asked a waitress for a menu  We then sat there for a further    minutes before she came back   we tried to order wine and she said she couldn t take the order and she would send someone over  Another    minutes passed at which point I gave her a look and she sent someone over  At this point oils and dips for the bread arrived   but no bread   after    minutes we fianally caught the breadman s eye and he wandered over  The wine turned up as our starters did to which we were told that was good timing   to us it wasn t   it would have been nice to enjoy a glass of wine before eating  Our maincourses arrived fairly quickly but we didn t have any cutlery   to which we had to ask and waited a good   minutes for   we constantly had to ask for our wine to be topped up   it was a nightmare   which was a shame because the food was excellent but so let down by such shoddy service   a real surprise in a country that prides itself on luxury and quality of service Thankfully the service did improve in the other restaurants  Pier Chic is excellent   the food and service spot on  La Parilla in the Jumeriah Beach is excellent   a real carnivores paradise   excellent atmosphere and good service  Zeng He s in the Mina Salam was excellent and very good service The cocktail bar in the Al Qasr is great   a fantastic place to chill out and the souk offers some lively bars   the Band in Zar Bar in the souk on a Tuesday night were brilliant We did a Dhow Cruise one night was was good fun and worth doing We had lunch on the Friday at the ina Seafood attached to the Jumeriah Beach   be warned   there is a dress code   long trousers and shoes   we weren t told of this and my husband turned up in     length trousers and flip flops   they did let us after a bit of a fuss    no one had told us about the dress code for lunch  but the husband was asked to not walk around   Considering that it is a buffet brunch it was a bit silly   the menu was very hard to understand and it wasn t what we expected we wanted to pick of the a la carte menu but instead had one of the weirdest concoctions ever   the place was packed though and it does seem to attract the beautiful people   probably lured by the free sparkling wine on offer  Wouldn t recommend it   also was a bit annoyed to see other men coming in wearing short shorts and the way some of the women were dresses was quite offensive and yet hubby had been told not to walk around in     length trousers   Perhaps we were not of the right set All in all I think this resort has become too popular and too busy and they just can t handle it   perhaps could be described as a victim of its own success  The level of service compared to   years ago had fallen dramatically and the resort itself is only just over   years old  The service for a   star resort is just not up to scratch I think they are pushing Dubai to its limits   you get stuck in traffic everywhere you go and a lot of the building work isn t finished yet   if the roads can t cope now   how will they cope in   years when it is all complete Compared to   years ago this was very disappointing   lets hope they pick up their game soon  
N =>   Pure Opulence We spent a week at the Al Qasr with our   year old son in ember  We were astounded by the extremely high level of service provided from the moment we arrived to our departure Cold towels on arrival with traditional dates and Arabic coffee were served to us  check in was easy  a few forms as usual and then straight to our room   Our room was amazing  immaculately clean and well presented All members of staff were always courteous and nothing was ever too much trouble    in fact quite the opposite  Other members have written about  quot false friendliness quot  and lack of good service  This was certainly not our experience  We were always greeted with a smile and never had to lift a finger all week  By the pool we were treated daily to cold flannels  sliced cucumber for your eyes  fresh fruit on skewers and refreshing home made orange lollies   Life guards were always vigilant and provided a professional service  All restaurants we ate in provided an impeccable level of service and quality of food  The aray and choice of each restaurant menu is fantastic  Our son was treated like royalty everywhere we ate and indeed throughout the whole week We cannot fault this hotel in any way and will definitely be returning next year for more of the same  
N =>  Service not worth top Euros charged the hotel complex  the rooms and the restaurant for half board are all very beautiful  At the beach nice wooden beds with comfortable matresses are offered and there is enough space even when Medinat is full we booked a seaview room  our flight arrived late at night and we had to change rooms   times because the check in agent wanted to give us rooms with obstructed views  I apologized for causing so much work to the luggage porter and he told me that he is used to roaming through the hotel because  quot they always want to get rid of the worst rooms first quot the bad service continued at the beach  where we had to wait for drinks    minutes at breakfast one had to wait for a table in queue because there were not enough tables for all guests this is only very aggravating because a night at Al Quasr is     Euros minimum and for this amount of money I can stay at a Four Seasons hotel where service is impeccable Al Quasr has to decide if they want to continue to charge top euros then they have to offer top service or they lower the prices right now I feel one is overcharged in comparison to all other Asian beach hotels 
N =>   Was not that impressed  We stayed at Al Qasr during the second week of ust and was quite disappointed with it If you are going to Dubai for the first time  it is an ideal location as there is a lot going on in the madinat and the setting and waterways are great However we feel the standards and service are nowhere near as good as some hotels we ve stayed in Dubai in the past We had problems when checking in as we were given the wrong room type  when we explained they had given us the wrong room we were told the hotel was full and there was nothing they could do Eventually a day later after much persistance we were given the right room Our main complaint about the hotel  did not lie with the hotel staff but more the guests that were staying there We are afraid the  chavs  have discovered the madinat complex The pool was heaving and by  am most of the sunbeds were reserved  We went down the pool one morning at  am and saw loads of people  who were all british  reserving sunbeds and not returning until  pm They would leave giant plastic lilos all over the place and kids were running wild The kids were spitting in the pool and loads of people just treat the lifeguards as baby sitters We went to the Mina pool one day which was even worse we also thought our room was looking a bit tatty Don t get us wrong  we went during the six weeks holidays so we expected lots of families to be there  However we have been going to Dubai for the last few summers and we ve never been to a hotel where we struggled to get a sun bed by   am If we wanted all of the above we could have went to Benidorm We were speaking to a few other people who were regular travellers to Dubai and they also thought the same as us and were most probably not likely to return to one of the Jumeirah properties Most of the    hotels in Dubai offer good service and treats etc by the pool and I feel The madinat has a lot to do if it wants to consider itself amongst the best We feel the main problem with this complex is it is too busy  If you are not travelling with kids I would not recommend this hotel during the school holidays  
N => ParadiseMLane Ireland Having been to dubai many times  this has to be my favourite hotel  the al qasr is just unreal with decor to die for  the moment you walk in the lobby  u know that u have come to a special place of class  quality and sheer beauty when i came back to ireland from dubai namely the al qasr i was telling everyone about this hotel and they thought i was in planet zorro but i was not  i was just after coming back from paradise  another planet unknown to many hotels When myself and my lady went there  she also fell in love with the hotel and every single time we go back and even if we dont stay here  we go here for a few drinks and relax outside watching the light show of the burj al arab  wow wow wow Guys and girls you will have to see this place to believe  words cannot decribe the sheer beauty of this resort and yes its a bit more expensive but worth every single penny i can be contacted by email should anyone have questions on dubai  what to do or anything lanemeist gmail com My advice to people would be to get on the net  book this and go  u will not be disappointed i tell you not 
N => Pure Luxury After quite bad confusion with our rooms to start with which resulted in me and my partner being sent to the wrong room  and also our bags being sent to another room and having to spend the night living out of a suitcase before we could be moved to correct room  it was an amazing holiday and staff could not do enough for you  and certainly made up for the room confusion by upgrading our room and sending us a card with snacks and champagne to apologise  the reveiws say it all  absolutly amazing hotel  breakfast in bed very good value too  worth trying the burj but VERY expensive for what the food quality was  Emerites Towers was a good experience and much cheaper  and also for a great Indian try Indigo which is a    minute taxi ride away  well worth trying  Alcohol far to expensive but in that heat all that quenches your thirst is water anyway    chinese was very nice but the best of all even better than the burj was the meat and co  absolutely the best meal ive had  and very busy so you have to book  breakfast average but always is everwhere so didnt bother us as this was expected  and was included so that was a bonus  inside was busy though so we usually had it by the pool  staff were amazing  was talking to one of the men who kindly took us on an abra boat around the  km radius of the hotel  which is well worth doing and he told us there was     members of staff  and could not do enought for you  too much at times though  one night they came to our room  times in    minutes once was because we had asked for a bucket of ice which we did everynite without any problems  but then they came to redo the room another time with fruit etc which did get irritating but we just kept do not disturb on until we went out  newspaper left on your door every morning  the one major thing which bothered me and my partner was the drinking age  as i am only    and him    we were unable to get in most places which was very annoying as when the bars were quiet they would let us in fine and when going on a busy night we were turned away which did spoil our nightimes quite often as we would have to give up and go back to our rooms  Anyone who stays here would be crazy not to think it is anything but perfect  especially the person who gave their reveiw   stars because the staff took too long to present them with cold towels and refreshing drinks  how pathetic  i have stayed in many   stars in different places and this was by far the VERY BEST EVER  you will love every minute of it  one little tip rather than spending more on a villa just get an upgraded room  my sister stayed in villa   which was very nice but the only real benefit of the villas is that they are right on the beach  but even she admitted that the premier suits were much better  the veiw from our room on the  th floor was out of this world  request room number      you can see EVERYTHING from the Burj which was lit up beautifully at night  to the Abras  the pool and the gorgeous clear sea  beware of jellyfish as my sisters boyfriend got stung  the life gaurds were at his side within seconds though   
N =>  What can I say  We arrived at  am to be greeted in such a pleasant manner Drinks and hot canopies in the lounge After getting our bags delivered settled to wake up to a beautiful sight  the waterways weaving in and out like a little Venice  Suberb The polite staff  the beautiful pool area and beach  the sunshine  in uary  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone Plenty of restaurants to chose from and everything superb  
N => Breathtakingly Beautiful We stayed for   Nights in ember at the Al Qasr at Madinat Jumeirah   Then went on to the Burj for   nights   see separate Review of another Superb hotel From the moment our Hotel greeter met us as we disembarked  we knew this was going to be a special trip  we were ushered through customs like VIP s  our baggage was collected and we were transported by limousine to a truly beautiful  Palace  Everything about the hotel was fantastic  The awesome entrance  the opulent lobby  the beautiful lounge we were taken into for check in  no check  in reception here  We were given breakfast in the executive lounge before being shown to our breathtakingly beautiful room  with outstanding views We were pampered for   days by very attentive staff  who gave us special treats of flowers  cake  card and chocolates as we were celebrating our anniversary that week  The resort was fantastic  Lovely little abras  water takis  to take us around to restauraunts  the lovely spa etc  The pool and beach were outstanding  and all the food we had was gorgeous  The souk was well worth a few trips  We are definately going back this year with our sons Thanks for a lovely stay  
N =>  Simply Luxury  Well  where do we begin    We stayed at the Al Qasr for our honeymoon  amp  it was truly amazing  The staff are all extremely polite  amp  courteous  amp  nothing was ever too much trouble  Our room was huge  amp  the bed  oh the bed   every morning we overslept as the bed just engulfed you  amp  the only thing that made you get out of bed was the calling of the sumptuous buffet breakfast of worldly delights   I particularly recommend that when you are seated you request poached eggs  they are cooked to order  amp  are absolute pecfection   The beach loungers must be made by the same people that make the beds  as these are THE MOST COMFORTABLE loungers I have ever had the pleasure of laying on  And at the height of the day when the beach attendants come round to offer you a spritz of water over your face or a cold face towel  I thought I had died  amp  gone to heaven  We would definatley recommend that you take an Abra around the hotel waterways  just stop at one of the many stations  amp  request that the guide take you for a tour  They are more than happy to oblige  amp  indulge their knowledge of the hotel  amp  various eateries  We stayed during Ramadan  amp  although some of the lounges were closed inside  the beach poolside restaurants were open  amp  so you did not feel that you were upsetting any muslim customs during the day  Don t be at all put off by staying in Dubai during Ramadan  It is great to be able to partake in the Iftar celebrations  Breaking of fast   amp  their shopping hours are extended  which in one of the shopping capitals of the world is never a bad thing   The Emirates Mall had just been opened  amp  although not all shops were open  we could see how this was going to be a great shopping experience   well worth a visit  Definatley recommend you visit Wild Wadi  it is not just for the kids   We also went for Friday Brunch at the Burj al Arab   a must just for the views of the Gulf Palm  amp  World projects   amp  the desserts   Enjoy  
N => Very different experience this time    I left a review on the  th e called  quot our best holiday ever quot  the holiday was so good that for the first time in our lives we booked to go back again  my husband always wants to try new places so as a rule however much we enjoy our holiday we dont go back we just try to find somewhere even better    When we arrived i knew immediately that the hotel had changed the guys that greeted us at the airport were as charming and efficient as last time but on arriving at the hotel there was no cold welcoming drink and it was a long wait before anyone appeared with a cold flannel we were just left to wait and then they realised that we had booked premium leisure rooms so they ushered us through to the breakfast area and then after a quick bite to eat up to our rooms  We booked the same as last time   interconnecting premium leisure ocean deluxe rooms but we were shown to a different wing of the hotel and the childrens room was down a corridor some distance from our room this was completely unacceptable so i refused to accept the rooms and after a while they found two more rooms which we accepted but again they were in the opposite wing of the hotel from where we stayed before so a long long way away from the premium leisure lounge and as a result we only bothered to go into the lounge twice having paid a lot of money for the upgrade  you get drinks and food at certain times of the day and on our previous stay we had used the lounge a lot When i did go to the lounge it was heaving with people and lots of children and on one occasion i managed to sit down with a magazine and in an hour no one had even approached me to ask if i would like a drink  last time they were so attentive  Breakfast was a nightmare it was impossible to get a table so we started ordering roomservice which was nice but not the same as getting out and picking what you wanted from a larger selection  We really got no benefit at all from the premium leisure service  the staff were so busy that we didn t even get them to book our restaurants for us we just phoned places direct from our room and as the hotel was so busy we couldn t get tables where and when we wanted them but all the meals we did have were very good  Room service seemed lazy after a few days they didn t bother to put the big decorative bed covers and all the cushions back on the childrens beds and make the room look like new again but all our sheets and duvets were changed everyday The showers in both rooms were beautiful but didn t work properly it drove us mad they were boiling hot one minute and freezing cold the next the fact that they were both like it seemed like too much of a coincidence to me and when i complained they said i needed to be in the room and they would try to get someone to take a look but noone came and i got fed up waiting  Surely at the prices they charge i should be allowed to sit on the beach whilst someone services the shower  i dont have to be in the room when they send someone to clean my room    No i think its a problem in a lot of rooms and they dont actually know what to do about it   Also the doors leading onto the balcony in the childrens room wouldn t lock which was unacceptable but again nothing was done about it during our stay and i put the chairs infront of the doors each night for security  unless spiderman was staying at the resort it was very unlikely that anyone was going to get in Also the big heavy wooden sliding door that leads into the bathroom was quite stiff and not running smoothly the door had a long worn patch on the wood where it was grinding with the door frame so wear and tear on the rooms is starting to show and the carpets had some stains  The pool area was a nightmare it was heaving with people and there was not a spare lounger in sight but we did manage to get some on the beach  The children didn t use the kids club very much this time as it was very busy and full of very young children but as last time i did find the staff in there to be very kind and welcoming  Due to ramadan the souk wasn t open during the day but that was the only real difference everything else was the same you could still order food and drinks around the pool and on the beach  There were lots of russian people staying at the hotel and i was shocked at how rude they are and how they treat the staff i m sure there are good and bad in all nationalities but it seemed without exeption that they were very unpleasant hotel guests  Overall the appearance of the hotel is very impressive and if you can travel out of the school holidays i m sure you will have a lovely time but at full capacity it feels way too busy and i am afraid that they have got greedy and seem to be packing the hotel with guests and then are unable to offer a full    service as it is just too busy and overcrowded  
N =>  It s Heaven  We spent   days at this hotel in y  Couldn t have dreamed of a nicer honeymoon  Amazing views of the resort  We thought it was nicer than the Burj because it was a little bit more relaxed and had fantastic decoration inside  Staff were very helpful  
N =>  Fantastic        The Al Qasr was Fantastic  we stayed between         sept for our Honeymoon and we couldn t have wished for better  We upgraded to Club Ex  and it was well worth it  When we got off the plane in Dubai we had somebody waiting for us they whisked us through passport control and we collected our bags straight away  we were then whisked to the Al Qasr in a very flash BMW  Our room was lovely great views  its would have been nice to be welcome with some champagne  we were on honeymoon  but we did recieve roses and a chocolate cake  The service around the pool was excellent  iced face clothes  fruit kebabs  iced cumcuber and they even offered to clean your sun glasses  The pierchic is a nice place to eat  didn t think much of the meat co  Fusion   La Royal Meriden is also nice  shame about the building work there though  With club ex  we got afternoon tea  with sandwiches and cakes and between       as much drink inc  champagne as you like and they also offered snacks  Overall a great place that has got the service spot on  Would defo go back  
N =>  Beware of over enthusiastic reviews We stayed   x adults  amp   x   y o   from         in an Arabian ior Suite special summer rate    USD The hotel is massively overpriced  and this was low season  compared to service  We got first a suite looking at staff entrance and taxi lane at hotel main entrance  After complaints and one night there we got moved  but only very late on second day  to a nice suite which we thought fitted the description  In an earlier review somebody mentionned Peninsula as similar  Well we just arrived from a Grand Deluxe one Bedroom Suite in Peninsula Bangkok at USD     all inclusive  I disagree that Al Quasr matches the Peninsula  Both from room size  quality and service  Service at Al Quasr is good but   star compared to the Peninsula   star service please stop talking about    amp    stars  the only thing which is    amp    star in Dubai is the price of rooms   It is not enough to be nice and polite  you need to be pro active and anticipate clients request  Al Quasr staff don t really know how to do this Hotel  Beautiful Palace type hotel in Arabian style Hotel room  Arabian ior Suite  Poorly isolated from corridor  you hear all the people passing in front of your door  no second door to isolate you from this noise  Very noisy Air Conditioning  in both suites we got  hard to believe for a   y o  hotel  The Peninsula Air Con is almost totaly silent and was built in       Size OK  But unnaceptable to have such suite with no good view  No flat panel TV  DVD available  Bathroom nice  no TV in bathroom as for Peninsula  Room service  goodService  Average  Polite  smiling but very often heavily repetitive  I got   calls and one letter to ask to confirm departure time and airport transfer which I had given already the day before   Food  we had access to the Leisure lounge  Good food and average drinks  Pommery champagne was nice  Pool  Cooled pool which is good  But Prison Guard type Lifeguards every    meters  In a pool which has    m depth max  Please note that all guards in sports shoe  very easy to take off an quickly jump in the water   Sea  very hot but no jellyfish which is a plus compared to Thailand Restaurants  did no try as overpriced  especially after Thailand Water  this is ufortunately the really shocking thing at this hotel  despite the heat  no free ice water is available at the pool or at the beach  Both Peninsula and Hyatt we stayed at in Thailand offered this  I think this is a small profit policy Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information  
N =>    STAR The best hotel we have ever stayed service first class Kids club excellent breakfast has to be seen to be believed Everything previous reviewers have said is True Will be returning in ruary     
N => Fab place as other reviews state it is actually   different  hotels  within the overall resort which translates as the city of jumeirah  you have access to it all   via abras  boats   buggies or walking  plus you can walk or ride along the promenade to burj al arab  jumeirah beach and the water park  to see it  esp at night  has to be believed  you will love this place   it is stunning  spotlessly clean  luxurious  unique and very stylish  although huge  c km end to end and c     guests  it never feels busy or crowded and the c     staff provide an exceptional service   the views at burj al arab at night are incredible as are the views of the resort itself   esp from the many roof top and upper level bars e g  kouba bar in the al qasr hotel we  couple   male    s  female    s  flew in from the uk for a six day break first week in may  landed at the airport  met by a personal guide who fast tracked us thru customs  collected luggage and escorted us to our chaufeur driven beemer  pre booked for c    each way   bargain  for the    mins trip to hotel  we flew overnight landing at     am local time so this great service really helps at the resort itself we were staying in the summer houses  dar al masyaf  so we had a private check in area and our room was available immediately so we were able to shower and have a quick sleep  i had requested an early check in and i don t know if this was typical but they said even if the room had not been available they would have given us a temporary room to change   sleep etc but being able to get straight to our room really helped  
N => Not for everyone Great service and lovely hotel  but atmosphere very  quot empty quot  feeling  Happy hour in Club Executive not very happy considering all the champagne being consumed  Good time  but wouldn t go back  
N => Excellent resort hotel  Much better than Mina A  Salam  
N => Just Superb   
N =>  Disney meets Arabia but slow service  
N =>   Al Qasr mit das beste was ich gesehen habe   
N =>  Terrible Stay I returned to the Angsana for a weekend with my family as my first stay was stay on a buisness trip in uary was very pleasant  however on the return trip the room was not clean  stains on bed  dust everywhere and the room attendant seemed annoyed that he had to redo the room  Breakfast buffet was downgraded from my last visit and deffinetly not up to any   star standards  Service was below average and not even the restaurant manager seemed to know what was on the menu I asked to speak to senior management regarding this issues but was told that noone was on duty Spend your money somewhere else as they dont seem to care at all about their guests  
N => We had a wonderful stay My wife and I had a wonderful and enjoyable stay at the Angsana Hotel in Dubai  Our suite was excellent  with two big plasma screens  DVD player  free internet connection  kitchen with fridge  microwave  coffee machine  toaster  electric cooker  washing machine  etc  We will definitely book this hotel next time we fly to Dubai and do not hesitate to recommend Angsana hotel to anyone who plans to travel to Dubai on vacation or on business  It is ideal for families with children Thanks to all the staff at Angsana Hotel who made our stay so pleasant Mr   amp  Mrs  DissanayakeFrankfurtGermany 
N => Excellent service I went to Dubai for the first time with my parents  and we stayed in Angsana  Our stay was wonderful  we had a Two Bedrooms Suite  and it was fabulous  The view was beatiful From the bellman to the spa therapist  everybody was very nice and the service was more excellent at all times  They went the extra mile to satisfy our demands  specially the concierge  In room dining was great  the staff were always friendly and smiling on the phone and then in the room We would definitely visit Angsana Dubai again    
New hotel but dirty and location not great Way too much dirt for this new hotel  I dont think they know how to clean the hotel  The pool bathrooms had water on the floor all day long and nobody attended to them  The food by the pool was awesome  loved the Fatoosh salad  Since the hotel is new  not too many things wrong with it  Starbucks was one block away  which was great  but can drivers had no idea where it was located  Great for a family that needs a   bedroom  Very very slow internet connection  but it was free  
N =>   Enjoyed my stay John MichaelGaskins Rd  Wembley  UKI had a very enjoyable stay together with my wife at the Angsana Hotel and Suites Dubai during the first week of tember    and was happy to have one of the best hotel experience especially with the very friendly front office and restaurant staff  The remarkable service along with the cheerful faces were major contributor to our happiness My wife and I had a wonderful and relaxing Spa treatment and we are looking forward to enjoy it when we have our first chance to go back  many thanks to the very professional Spa staff The only thing that was not up to our expectation was the heat and humidity which did not allow us to enjoy the open air pool on the rooftop I really enjoyed the personalized service throughout my stay  and praise the staff on their good service  John Michael 
N =>  what a nightmare The worst hotel I have ever stayed in There is very little here that can be regarded as   star either in terms of facilities  attitude or service  save the trouble and anguish and go somewhere else  there are truly brilliant hotels in Dubai Being a fan of Banyan tree and Angsana  I booked on a promotion which was an introductory offer  This did not point out that I would be a guinea pig  that it would take    minutes to check in because the staff could not operate the system  that the spa was not running  the hotel was a building site  the room stank of sewerage  the aircon didnt work  the lifts were faulty  corridors full of litter  and that this is NO WAY anywhere near a   star hotel related in any way to Banayan tree  The managers had no idea as to what being a   star hotel meant at all or as to what customers service meantThe lowlight of the experience was that I was awoken at  am by screaming children  banging doors and banging on the walls  The phones didnt work     and when the children refused to keep quiet  I had to get dressed and go to reception  via a    minute wait for a lift in an empty hotel  where the duty manager asked me if I wanted to move rooms    A sleepy eyed guest  half dressed in a five star hotel iI was told that they couldn t control their guests and that to reach reception one needed to dial     with no phone directory  the obvious choice after trying              etc  I was exhausted and went back to bed Night   was the same  The hotel chose not to move the noisy guests and the duty manager told me  the quiet guest trying to get a nights sleep  that I could move elsewhere to another hotel There are such outstanding hotels in Dubai  Banyan tree and Angsana are great hospiltality brands in themselves  but stay here at your peril Writing this down leaves me stunned  the staff and managers were so incompetent what does one do except warn others  
N =>  fantastic hotel in a great location i travelled to arabian hotel with my   year old mum and it was a fantastic choice  it was  mins walk to the shops in Mina bazar  It had great breakfast and service overall was very good  i would definately come back and stay in this hotel  the spa was worth the price paid    there is also a free ride to and from the jumeriah beach 
N =>   Excellent  Fantastic location for doing Indian shopping   can get all suits  sarees and indian jewellery on the doorstep  No need to travel to India   its more that conveneint to do wedding shopping here  
N =>  In transit Overall I enjoyed my stay  I was in transit from Afghanistan to the US and wanted a place to decompress  The room was comfortable  bed so so but huge    great to have free in room internet  TV channel choices were not so good but definitely something very every culture language  Was at first concerned about being on  nd flr but the view was straight out on the Dubai Museum and it was noise free  For a     day fee I did a  p check out since I had a late flight  Cost of room service was higher than other hotels  Location is great for shopping and seeing things  if I d wanted to    hotel will also help with tour arrangements  Grocery store down the street  Gym was good  Very friendly service from all staff  Would stay here again easily  especially if I wanted to be more touristy  
N => Good position good value Really convenient position opposite Duabi Museum and on the Big Bus route  The hotel has easy access to the Creek and it was very easy to catch an Abra to the other side to the Gold Souk  Driving there was also easier than I anticipated althougth I did get caught in a couple of traffic jams  Once you are there you don t need a car as there is lots to see in walking distance Service was friendly  sitting in the Asian Restaurant overlooking the shops and the night lights eating good food was very pleasant  
N =>  Arabian by night Arabian by stay    We loved our stay  The hotel was typical arabian  Not like a bland hotel in any city in the world  The staff were very pleasant and extremely attentative to all our needs Booking extra activities was done by hotel staff with much grace Sherlock Holmes Bar was friendly and the breakfast buffet menu was absolutely delicious  The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfortable You will most definitely enjoy your stay Peter and Cherie from Sydney Australia 
N =>   This hotel was excellent service was always efficient and friendly We arrived early in the morning we were greeted with warm and friendly service they made an effort to try and get us a room as we had travelled overnight from Mauritius  we were given coffee and while we were drinking this we were given a room which was a blessing as we were very tired  The service in all the restuarants and bar were excellent any question on the city or hotel were answered with no problem could not fault this hotel at all well done to all staff they made our holiday a pleasure  
N =>   Excellent hotel for price Arrived at the hotel at  am to be told check in wasnt until  pm which we actually knew  We was told that they would do there best to give us the room as soon as possible  We went for breakfast in the hotel which cost    dir per person which was good value as there was no limits to the amount or what you wanted At    am we was given our room with no extra charge  The rooms are of a good size and were clean  The only problem with this hotel was although there was a resturant extra in the hotel there wasnt many other places in the area to get a meal unless you like kfc everynight However everything else you need was there dont let kfc put you off 
N =>   Superb and friendly service I arrived for the weekend of    ust with my young son to meet up with relatives travelling from Australia and accompanied by a friend  Upon arrival we were greeted in a friendly way and our keys to rooms allocated swiftly  Room service was fast and internet service efficient  Reception staff were absolutely excellent as were everyone else  My friend then went to stay at another hotel  already booked  but after only two days returned to the Arabian Courtyard as it was so much better  especially the service  
N =>   lovely traditional hotel   already booked again  This was my first time in Dubai and I loved it immensely  This hotel was fantastic   we arrived early but instead of making us wait for our room we got a free upgrade to an executive room  We even got a free massage in the gorgeous and clean spa  The pool was great but beware the shallow end is very   shallow  The concierges were extremely helpful and informative and I loved the man out the front in the traditional costume  Endured extremely hot conditions but always had a smile on his face  Breakfast was delicious  American  amp  local with a gorgeous view  Can t wait to try the terrace bar and the convenient English pub this time round  
N =>  Excellent   Will be back  Great location  great hotel and great staff  We had a fantastic time here at this hotel  We booked it due to it being a lot more traditional hotel rather than all the new builds I have to stay in with my job  Right in the heart of old Dubai  about   mins walk to creek and the water buses that run from there  It s opposite the museum  which was surprisingly good   The museum is also on the  quot Big Bus Company quot  tour  if you re into that  so you can hop on   off there  It also has a free courtsey shuttle to the airport  which we didn t realise and was a nice extra  We got taxi to the hotel and the shuttle back  My wife  amp  I were the only ones booked into the shuttle  so when we arrived ten mins later two of the attentive staff whisked our cases into the boot and we were off We found staff helpful  We had booked an early check in which cost somewhere around    GBP for us both  I arrived at  am and we were given a non smoking room instantly with no hassle  Our early check in fee included free breakfast for us both  The breakfast was really good   pleantiful buffet  with choice of full English  contintial or traditional I used their website to book directly and didn t experience any of the below problems in prior reviews   maybe this has been resolved  or I got lucky  Anyway  I hope to return to Dubai and plan to stay here next time too  
N =>  Just gorgeous  Will definitely be back  Stayed in this hotel with my wife  for our first trip to Dubai  The hotel could not have done any more to make us feel welcome  We got checked in earlier at no extra cost due to our flight arriving very early in the morning  Shortly after we got to our room  there was a knock at the door  and there was a hotel porter with a cake for us  as I had told them previously that our stay coincided with our wedding anniversary  How nice The room was great  overlooking the museum  Very clean  and the housekeeping staff were always really friendly and very courteous  and also EXTREMELY honest  We came back one day to find a    dirham note on our bedside cabinet that had obviously fallen out of a pocket or purse onto the floor  The housekeeper had found it and left it for us The pool is great  We went every day and there were always other travellers there  and we all shared stories of what we d done that day  or what we were going to do the next day  and got loads of ideas from each other  Very sociable  and never overcrowded  The bars in the hotel were also very nice  and teh staff  as with everywhere else in the hotel  were really friendly  The english bar  Sherlock Holmes was a nightly haunt for us  and we were surprised at just how good the english food they served was Overall  this hotel contributed massively to making our first trip to Dubai such a special one  We ve travelled around the world a fair bit over the last few years  but can t remember many other places where we ve been made to feel so welcome  It was like we were guests in their house  rather than just paying customers  We can t wait to go back Darren  amp  Rani Greaves 
N =>  Definitely Bed Bugs in the room My partner and I read some reviews and decided to stay there in   On my first night I had a severe skin irritation  I let it go on this night but on the second night I could not stand it anymore  I was itching all over my body and the manager offered me the hotel taxi to get antihistamine from a chemist  He also moved us to another room but stated that there were no bed bugs  The rest of my stay was comfortable but I would not recommend the hotel to anyone  My room with bed bugs was on the fourth floor  
N =>   Bad checkin experience We booked this hotel because it offered a guaranteed checkin   hours before the usual check in   at a price which we happily paid  This was useful because we arrived in Dubai after a    hour flight  Also  prior to booking  we contacted the hotel because we d heard stories about the smoking rooms  Many hotels offered non smoking rooms but would not gaurantee it  We contacted the hotel before confirming the booking to advise them that I suffer from asthma so it was important that we have a smoke free room as the stench of smoke could cause irritation and make things a little difficult for me  They were nice enough to confirm a non smoking room due to my circumstances and I have the email to prove it The problems started on arrival as they said that a room was not available even though we d paid for the early checkin  We arrived at  am so I understand that we were early for the early checkin which I understand is from  am  So this wasn t really a problem for me  I understood that I had to wait until  am During th checkin process  they advised that the room would be ready in a lttile while and I asked to confirm the non smoking room   they said that it was a smoking room  I advised them that we d contacted the hotel before making the booking to confirm that we could be gauranteed a non smoking room  They advised that no rooms were available at this time and offered me a smoking room which was immediately available  We walked to the run to see if we could get by but weren t able to take a step into the room because the stench of cigar   cigarette smoke was incredible  We retruned to reception area where I asked for a refund as they weren t able to provide me a non smoking room  Amazingly  within    minutes  we were in a non smoking room which was quite nice and roomy  I don t understand why this room wasn t made available to us when we first arrived at the hotel  Nobody had checked out in the time that we were in reception so this room must have been available when we arrived Apart from the above experience  we had to ask that the towels be replaced because they were dirty  It looked like they d dropped off the cleaners cart and were run over by the wheels The room itself was quite big and clean and the hotel location was fine  Apart from the checkin experience  staff were courteous and helpful  The pub attached to the hotel is quite good and offers pub style meals I d recommend this hotel to smokers   others should be weary   I just don t understand why they lied to us on checkin  
N =>   A nice and pleasant hotel with good resteraunts We booked in to have a look at Dubai before flying on to Australia  We were made welcome and the check in was smooth  The staff at the hotel could not do enough for us  even insisting on walking to the museum to buy tickets for us  it is only     meters away    The Chinese resteraunt was excellent and Nurit  our waiter was very helpful and funny The air con is also a Godsend  
N =>   Good Hotel but dont book thru their website Hotel is good and they have some great offers in these lean times But beware   DO NOT BOOK thru their website I had a similar experience as  Happybumbum  who had written earlier I had booked the prepayment special two weeks in advance thru their website for a   nite stay They billed my credit card immediately and they blocked a similar amount as well  This is akin to charging double I wrote to them immediately and they said it was a mistake and it will be cancelled We had a wonderful stay at the hotel except for this  When i asked at the desk  they said it has already been cancelled Well  it has been two weeks now  and it is not yet reflected in my credit card details So  wonderful hotel  but dont use their website for booking  
N =>   THE PLACE TO STAY  When somebody on holiday they expect every thing perfect with value for money This hotel fills the bill Cheerful well trained staff Period setting through out the hotel Cleansyness in room and restaurants Starbuck coffee bar in lobby Directly oposite the musume  In heart of well known Mina Bazar Walking distance to most aminities including little boat crossing a must I WILL NOT HESITATE TO RECOMEND TO ANYBODY Internet is not included in most roomIts bit expensive at    AED a day Family suit do have free internet  Masum Karolia York s U K  
N =>  good hotel to start with but ended in dissapointment great hotel to start with fast easy check in room clean and tidy  until i found out my acc was almost charged double on what i booked upon  when i asked the reception staff about this the following day they advised me its like a bond that they hold and return once i check out  well its been over   days and nothing returned to me yetBE AWARE about this as i sighted NO paper work describing that they charge this extra amount or signed any paper work confirming they can do this  very dissapointing as like any visa or debit credit card gets charged an internetional admin fee to use overseas because they withdrew a larger amount i was charged double in admin fee   very dissapointing and im still waiting for an explination from then about this situationall my family have stayed at the arabian courtyard and spa and none had this charge so its either a mistake or a change for the worse in managementat the checkout the same reception staff assured me this extra amount will be refunded back to my acc ASAP its been   days and NOTHING   BEWARE TRAVELLERS  P S  DIAL UP INTERNET not good it took   minutes to load   pages very slack   and you have to pay   DHR to use their steam room very sad 
N =>   Better than expected Overall I was very pleased with this hotel  I thought it was fantastic value for money  Easy check in and no problems with our stay or bill  After having   star hotels keep us waiting on the trip this place did well  
N =>  Pretty comfortable stay I stayed at this hotel for   nights during one of my training programs  It was a rather comfortable experience where I found the service very much attentive  The only problem was that I could not get the no  smoking floor during  st night as the other guest in adjoining room were smoking heavily causing me problem  But then on my request  I was given another room on no smoking floor  amp  the problem was resolved  The food ofered was of high quality  amp  the breakfast was hot  amp  well served I prefer to stay there during next visits 
N =>  This hotel is a gem I had to come to Dubai on business and I brought my wife along with me  We found the hotel on Expedia  From the minute we drew up in the taxi till the day we left I could not fault anything in the hotel  We came off the flight at       in the morning and arrived by taxi  to be met at the hotel door by the porters  As we signee in we were given a welcome drink and really made to feel comfortable The hotel was spotlessly clean  the service was second to none  indeed the staff pre empted our needs by remembering what we took to eat or drink We used the Chinese  Sherlock Holmes pub and the foyer to eat in the food was reasonably priced and very tasty  The pool was smallish but fine for our needs  and like the other staff the pool attendants were very attentive and looked after us from day   The hotel is located in the older part of Dubai  but very near to some really old shopping areas  where you can barter a really good bargain The creek is only   minutes walk and well worth a trip across  the boat drivers can be as aggressive on the water as the drivers on the roads  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel    
N =>   No Frills Hotel     Positives     Location  Beach ShuttleImprovements needed     Swimming pool way too small  Bathrooms way too crammed  Not enough English TV channels    out of       Why do you charge   dhms everytime to use the Sauna Steam    No WiFi  Daily newspapers to the rooms  Overall  if you plan to spend most of your time away from the hotel and only need somewhere to sleep  book the Arabian Courtyard     
N =>  an oasis of luxury and excellent service We spend   days in the hotel  Staff could not do enough for you  nothing was a bother  There was even a  quot turn down your bed service quot  at night with wee chocolates left for you  The food was fab  alcohol was reasonably priced and we loved the location  just facing the dubai museum and a mosque which gave as a cultural experience  The wellbeing spa was fantastic  packages of all sorts of treatments  I opted for a full body massage and facial which was heavenly and very very reasonably priced  There was well establised local shops nearby and we were near the tradional souks  markets  refreshingly traders were not to pushy and let you walk on by without to much pressure  But not to be missed is the water taxi  a couple of pennys and it is like going back in time We will be retunring to our oasis of luxury  
N =>  Don t go or if you do keep your expectations low  We booked at the Arabian Courtyard on the recommendation of a good friend that travels alot  We also booked  quot early check in quot  online  as advised by the confirmation email  only to not have a room after we had flown all night from our prior destination  That was the beginning of a serious of relatively minor irritations    we did get a room after waiting in the lounge for about   hour and buying two cups of coffee and two pastries to the tune of      We were told we got an  quot upgrade quot   but in fact we were in the exact type of room that I booked originally  Have no idea what the upgrade was  When we finally were able to check in  I asked  three times   if breakfast was included with the early check in price        and the front desk staff    different people    different times  said YES  it s included  It was not and I had to argue over the course of my   day stay with a number of incompetent front desk staff about removing the charges for breakfast  We had another snafu trying to sign up for the shuttle to the beach  Not worth going into all the detail    but they kept saying the shuttle was full  the shuttle was full    and it turned out that there were      EMPTY seats on the shuttle  Then the concierge that put us into a private taxi  when a regular meter taxi was right IN FRONT of the hotel  We paid     times what we should have to go to Madanat Jumeriah  UGH  Did not like staying there     
N =>   Bug Bugs and Stolen Credit Card We had bed bugs  Got bitten all over  Hotel staff didn t seem to believe it could be true  despite the bites all over our body and pictures we took of the little critters on the mattress in the morning  They didn t give a discount or apology We checked out but our flight wasn t until the night  so we left our bags in storage  When we came back in the evening to collect our bags and go to the airport  one of the suitcases was totally bashed in A week after we returned home  I got a call from the credit card company  The back up credit card I had stashed inside my suitcase had been stolen and used throughout Dubai  
No way a   star hotel with only   star service Having just returned from a   night stay at the Arabian Courtyard we were very disappointed  Have been visiting the UAE for a number of years and this was the worst hotel we have every stayed at  We paid the additional supplement for the Exec Club Room  which gave us access to the Exec lounge  the staff there along with the rest of the hotel were very disinterested and had absolutely no idea about customer service  The breakfast relied on the customers asking for buffet to be replenished resulting in a long wait for the basics such as eggs  On the first night we asked for a Gin and Tonic but they had run out of Gin as they could only order once a week  They would not check any of the other bars in the hotel so there was no gin for the first   nights  as an alternative they offered Tequila  Avoid the wine   we observied them mixing   different white wines into the Chardonnay  The Sherlock Holmes bar was no diffenrent  one person on the bar who was also the waitress waiting on the tables and collecting the food from the kitchen   resulting in long waiting times to be served  The food in the bar was awful unless you like reconstituted chicken  however described at a succulent and home made  Avoid the peanuts and popcorn  these were recycled when collected from the tables and bar  The iron in the room was dangerous with exposed live wires   we did ask for a replacement iron from receiption by day   it had still not been replaced     sunbeds round a pool approximately   x    metres and in desperate need of maintenance  On the last day half way through checking out the receptionist walked away from us and then dealt with   phone calls The best part was the room attendant who did a good job of cleaning the room  The rest was a major disapointment in what was described to us as an award winning hotel  I know what award I would give it                    
N =>  Poor value for money Booked this hotel for   female friends for a week in Dubai at the begining of      Should have listened to the previous reviews as the customer service in this hotel was poor  Reception could not provide an answers in regards to Tourist things  This was my second trip to Dubai and as I had previously stayed in Jumeirah i decided a hotel away from the beach would be different  Finally the decor in the rooms could do with an update  Value for money   you could do a lot better Service   need to provide more training to staff Location   OK  however trying to reach other parts of town is expensive from this Hotel   average taxi to Malls  Beach would cost        each way  Would not chose this hotel or recommend to anyone who is looking for a relaxing trip  Only plus point of hotel was the Mumtaz Indian restaurant which provided in house entertainment  
N =>   Excellent hotel My wife   amp  I stayed at the Arabian courtyard hotel for   nights during the Mens  Tennis Tournament and had an excellent stay The room was clean  spacious  amp  comfortable with all the amenities that we required All the staff were courteous  friendly  efficient and helpful  Newspaper was provided every day as was fruit Breakfast was substantial with a variety of choice and all in all we would thoroughly recommend the hotel  amp  hope to return next year to see the Ladies  Tennis in ruary  
N =>   definitely recommended   nice room friendly staff this hotel is definitely value for money and adequate for a nice stay in dubai  we arrived early in morning but our room was not ready so we waited in lobby  we had booked executive room on  th floor for our anniversary  when we were taken upto our room we were pleasantly surprised to have the bed decorated with rose petals in a heart shape and bath filled with bubbles and roses  it was a nice touch which started our holiday in dubai  the room was cleaned everyday  the sheets changed etc  dont think they brushed up though as room was quite dusty  when i dropped some socks on the floor  they were covered in dust balls but apart from that room looked clean  the bed was sooo comfortable we slept better there than we do at home  all the staff were always smiling and friendly  the doorman traffic controller bakhsish was the best  he always put a smile on our faces  just seeing him made us smile  we definitely noticed his absence on his day off  the reservations team was very helpful too in helping us confirm our booking as we had problems with our travel agent  but faisal in reservations was a gem and sorted everything out for us so we could relax checkin and checkout was fast  the only downside being that we had to wait a few hours to checkin after a long flight  we also decided to enquire about booking a dhow cruise dinner through hotel  but we were given reciept and charged    dirhams for   people when we knew from our research that it would be much cheaper had we booked it ourselves as we did with desert safari  moreover  the cruise was disorganised and the worst part of our holiday as it dragged on forever and food was bland and tasteless too  in contrast thesafari which we bookd our selves was brilliant  well organised and the highlight of our holiday  so we were very disappointed with the cruise and annoyed that we paid over the top for something of such a low standard  anothercouple from the hotel who booked the same way felt the same said they could have had much better entertainment and food for the price we paid  we have emailed our comments to the hotel who are looking into this but despite this we cannot fault the hotel itself  as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we felt very welcome and would not hesitate to stay there again  the free   minute massage was a delight too and if we had more time we would definitely have used spa facilities more although we did feel they were quite expensive   massages were dearer than in uk  and they always seemed to be booked up whenever we rang to enquire  when we did find a slot on our last day  we were told full body massage didnt include feet which is strange as usually this is not the case  so we just decided to cancel as was overpriced anyway  the pool area was clean although water was cold so we didnt use it  the hotel is in bustling area of bur dubai which you either hate or love  there was lots to do all around  whereas in the beach hotels there is nothing surrounding so you have to stay inside the hotels  but here we went for nice walks in evenings when the area litup the salon was closed whilst we were there which was a disappointment as i had to go out to get blowdry but if the spa prices are anything to go by then it probably would have been overpriced anyway  so in conclusion  this hotel itself and the staff are excellent and recommended but we would not use hotel to book tours etc as highly overcharged we would love to stay at this hotel again  infact we miss the hotel and dubai very much    
Nice location Great on Executive Floor I stayed for several days at this hotel  I can t speak to the other room types  but the exec floor including internet and breakfast was a good deal  It is across from the Dubai Museum  be sure to go downstairs at the museum  some people miss the entrance  and near the old markets and the river  There aren t many restaurants in the vicinity but there are a few  There are several supermarkets within a few minutes walk  The staff was very friendly and accommodating  
N =>  Good Clean Hotel I have just read a review of this hotel where it was given a poor rating and I felt i had to write a reply  I am a well seasoned traveller and have stayed everywhere from sleeping in a tent in Namibia through to luxery cruises and I felt that the review was unfair  One thing you have to remember about this hotel is that it is in old Dubai not the new part  For this you must travel by taxi  trust me dont walk as i found out much to my cost as this is heat that you have never experienced before  Taxis are very cheap and called to the door by the porter while you wait inside  On arrival at the airport we were picked up by the hotel  which although more expensive than a taxi I felt it was well worth well as the flight is long and it was great not having to ask taxi drivers rates etc On arrival our rooms were ready and bags taken up for us Excellent check in  polite and professional  Yes a credit card is needed but arent alot of hotels asking for these now a days  The rooms are large and the bed is huge  Im     quot  and i thought all my dreams had come true  The bathroom was large and the shower was very powerful  The view was different  not of white sands and blue seas but of old Dubai with all of its buildings  Be prepared to be woken by the call to prayer because there are at least three large mosques in proximity to the Hotel The food was good we ate lunch twice here over the five days and breakfast ever day  Breakfast was a large buffet with everything from cold meats  fruit to a full cooked breakfast  Lunch was off of a menu and very reasonable although not the best cuisine I have tasted  The pool was of a good size and the sunbeds were readily avaliable  but as a female prepare to be looked at as my wife found out  The spa is very good and well worth a visit  The hotel was very clean and rooms well looked after It certainly isnt the Burj Al Arab but then you arent paying       a room  If you want good  clean accomdation and a reasonably priced hotel this is it  If you want   star treatment then new dubai is for you with the Western attitude  We couldnt fault it  but as I said from the start this hotel is in Old Dubai  new Dubai is a    min taxi drive away that wont cost you more than    I cant comment about the bars here as we went during Ramadam so there was no alcohol  
N =>   Great Deal  well worth it Already booked the hotel with the travel agents before i saw some of these reviews so initially i was a bit worried  But the hotel seemed to be well worth it for the price  my stay was enjoyable  i was there with my husband and daughter  Ofcourse visiting Dubai   the last place you spend yor time is in the hotel Its located in the Old City so its quite busy  but you dont hear the noise in your rooms    very friendly staff  we only ate in the hotel and not immeadiate surroundings  spent most of the time in the malls and site seeing and always ended up eating there  Easy access to taxi  right outside    room cleaned everyday   food was ok   buffet breakfast free with room  Im a bit suprised people were trying to walk in their immeadiate surrondings   i thought the whole holiday idea was to see the sites  Went to the beach as well  Overall great fun   and th ehotel was value for money              hence i had more money to spend in the shops Aimee  UK 
N =>   I m a honeymooner get me out of here  We booked our honeymoon with Hayes and Jarvis to the Maldives and on our return back to the UK we were told there would be a significant delay in catching our flight back to the UK from Dubai  We were offered a nights stay at this hotel and jumped at the chance to visit Dubai  After having ten glorious nights in Maldives we landed in Dubai and were greeted pretty promptly by the taxi service  laid on by H amp J  to transport us to our hotel  be naively I was expecting to stay closer to the  new Dubai  but when I got out of the taxi and looked at the hotel my heart sank  The hotel was dumped in the middle of dirty  dusty back streets full of drab  brown buildings  I thought I d landed in Baghdad  Inside the hotel was hardly   star  Gaudy and tatty  The reception desk staff were aloof and unfriendly and after finding our reservation which we d paid for with H amp J  asked us to hand over our credit card for any further purchases we would make at the hotel  I refused to hand my card over and told them I d pay cash if I wanted anything  We got changed and decided to take a walk around the hotel to find something to eat  Big mistake  There was nothing but fabric shops around the hotel and not one place to eat  I was looked at by men in the street as though I was an alien  despite being completely covered up and there really was nothing around this hotel to see  We ended up returning two hours later back to the hotel hungry  having not eaten since the plane journey  We found the Sherlock Holmes Bar situated in the hotel  where we had two drinks and decided to go to bed  Inside the bar were Arab men ordering jugs of beer and chatting up the prostitutes  Americans on the next table told me the food was just okay  but by this time I just wanted to go to my room and for morning to come  The room itself was bare  stark  cold  dark and smelled musty  We scoffed at the  view  from our room  endless flat rooftops of the same drab  brown buildings covered in satellite dishes  Thoroughly depressing  We d pre paid to have breakfast the following morning  but as we were leaving fairly early to catch our flight they said the kitchen wouldn t be open  We finally ate at Dubai airport just before departure  I couldn t wait to get on the plane and leave Dubai  It was a disappoinment  full of building cranes and massively spread out  As the plane took off for the UK  me and my new husband happily waved Dubai goodbye  Perhaps the new part of Dubai is better  but please don t waste your money at this hotel  
N =>   Seriously messed stay    Star at best   Star Service I don t know where to begin   For starters  this is a good location  Like everyone says  right across from the museum  amp  a short distance to the abras and the creek  but that s about it  The room is large  However  there is something funky fishy in the air about this place  and I couldn t wait to leave this hotel or Dubai  for that matter  The sourness started at another destination when I kept getting e mails saying that my reservation would be cancelled  quot without my knowledge quot  if I did not provide a  quot valid credit card number  quot  I kept e mailing back and forth saying that my credit card  quot was valid  quot  that I use it practically everyday  including for this trip  in fact  I e mailed that I used it for the hotel which I was currently staying at  They kept e mailing back to send a  quot valid credit card  quot  which I thought they must have punched in the numbers wrong  Thus  I responded by saying that I was unable to do that as I was traveling and had no way of providing the numbers in a secure fashion  I e  I did not want to give the numbers over my international cell phone  or through an e mail  I finally requested that my reservation be cancelled  and I made a new one through their own website  which was secure  I tried calling to cancel on the phone  and this seemed third rate  as I was told the reservation desk was not open until the morning  and it was       pm UAE time        hours later than where I was at  I was further surprised after viewing their cancellation policy that it was a   day cancellation period  To their credit  they received my e mail and cancelled my original reservation  To my benefit  my original reservation was     dh and the new one was      I guess the world economy  and I was told upon arriving to Dubai  that many tourists cancelled tours  etc  recently  is why the price went down  Anyway  this was a nice surprise  the difference in the room cost was about      to      USD  Fast forward to an approximate     hour overnight plane rides  I arrive at the hotel and the check in staff person was very rude  amp  hostile  Not friendly or welcoming at all  He seemed put out that I showed up with a reservation  which he could not find in his computer  The whole thing seemed very  rd world  not technologically advanced at all  One tired computer at his desk and some papers somewhere  Anyway  he kept getting on the phone to  quot someone quot  and asking me where I made the reservation  I said   quot On your website  quot  which I showed him the print out  I think he was not happy about the low rate which I showed up with  After a long time  with no smiles  not being welcomed or anything  he finally had me fill out some paperwork   amp  ran my credit card  During this time I explained about the back  amp  forth e mails that said my cc did no work  when in reality it did  which seemed to make him even more angry  After two attempts to run my credit card  he said in an angry tone of voice that it did not work  By this time I was getting really angry  amp  told him that it did work  I just used it for dinner prior to getting on the plane  amp  there was nothing wrong with it  I then proceded to use my international cell phone  amp  call ed the US to the cc company  who assured me that there was nothing wrong with it  that they showed no attempts of it being swiped by the hotel   amp  maybe he was swiping it too fast  or it got demagnitized being next to a cell phone  hotel key card or something  I relayed this information to him  further relaying what my cc company told me was that if he punched in the   s manually  then it should work  I told him to run it again  which he angrily refused  saying   quot No  I already ran it twice  I m not going to run it again  quot  I insisted  amp  told him that I did not believe him that it did not work  which he angrily  and reluctantly ran it again  not punching in the numbers  just swiping it  then asking for another cc card  or telling me to go to an ATM machine  At this point  I was very suspicious  as it seems they just wanted cash  I don t know  However  this person was adament that other guests cc s work ed  amp  it was just mine that didn t  What kind of screwed up service is this    It supposed to be a    hotel  Ha  During all of this  a girl came with a cup of juice with a straw in it   amp  placed it on what looked like a used paper doily with a stain on it  By this time  I was so angry  I wanted to catch a cab back to the airport   amp  change my ticket  get on the next flight out of Dubai   amp  return to my onward destination  all of which I told this desk clerk  which seemed to infuriate him more  I then asked if there was an internet cafe around  amp  he reluctantly said they have a  quot business quot  center in their lobby  which was    dh for one hour  I gave him the    amp  made a reservation with the cc that he insisted did not work on orbitz  pre paid  at the same rate of      night       with tax  When I return with this printed reservation  he did not seem happy about it  Again with the phone calls to someone far off  He finally said that  quot they quot  had not received the reservation confirmation and to  quot wait quot  until they received it  He  amp  the person on the phone did not offer to call orbitz or e mail them  or just to look at my reservation and see that it was pre paid  Nor did they offer for me to sit by the pool  have a drink or anything  They did not give any sort of timeline or offer to look into it  or check me in  until they got the reservation confirmation  etc  All in all  it was a very strange thing  No hospitality at all  In fact the exact opposite  Very rude  amp  hostile  After flying all night  needing a shower   amp  very tired  I called Orbitz in the US on my int cell phone  Orbitz got on the ball  amp  called this hotel  with a lot of long holds  with Orbitz having to call them back  That did the trick   amp  the angry front desk attendant finally got back to me that that received the confirmation reservation  To his credit  knowing I flew all night  he offered me a room  albeit a smoking room  although  quot check in time wasn t until   pm  quot  And to his credit  he said that I could check out the room  as it  quot didn t smell that bad  quot  and there would be a non smoking one available at    The room smelled bad  so back downstairs I went with the porter  Miraculously two other rooms were available  which I might have gotten upgraded to  There were ashtrays  amp  the porter said it was a smoking room  It smelled a little stale at first  amp  he offered to  quot spray it  quot  but it was okay  Fast forward  the room itself was pretty nice  It was just the way I was treated  like a criminal  who they think didn t have a valid cc is what soured it for me  Oh yeah  after saying the confirmation was there  he said he still needed a valid cc  amp  asked if I got my cc  quot sorted out  quot  I reiterated that it was valid   amp  I just pre paid that Orbitz with the same card  He said he needed a card in case I wanted to make phone calls or charge things to the room  He seemed very angry that I gave him that same card  which he quickly swiped again   amp  it did not work  Very fishy  Well  after getting to my room  I hopped in the shower  During my shower  I heard someone pounding loudly on my door  on   separate occasions  then phoning my room  After my shower  being so tired  I unplugged the phone   amp  crawled into bed  This seemed to be the norm of this hotel  however  very poor harrassing service  One night  after laying in bed with ear plugs in  the AC going   amp  the bathroom fan until      AM  I called the front desk to see if there was music left on in the pool area  I got a rude reception  where at first he said   quot hello  quot  then hung up  then took the info  amp  said he would look into it  No follow up  so I got dressed to see where the music was coming from  Approximately    minutes after my call  security was headed to my room to come inside  amp  check out the noise  Also very strange  I think they should have found the problem and not have some strange man come to my room  I was told there was a disco below my room  amp  that was where the noise was coming from  Thus  I got about   hours of sleep before getting up at      AM for an early morning tour  Right after returning to my room after my tour to take a nap  I received a phone a      PM  the day before I was to check out  by a male voice  front desk staff  demanding that he come up right then and there to  quot check quot  my mini bar  I was infuriated  amp  aghast  amp  said loudly  amp  firnly   quot No  I am taking a nap right now  I haven t used anything out of the mini bar  quot  The male voice kept insisting as we went back  amp  forth  amp  he said that he would  quot be right up  quot  Again  I yelled   quot NO    I M TAKING A NAP RIGHT NOW    YOU RE NOT COMING UP  quot  And  I hung up the phone  This was about the most messed up stay that I have ever had  I felt harrassed by this front desk clerk  When I saw him briefly once during my stay  he gave me an angry  hostile look  Seriously  with the world economy the way it is  travel will probably be down  and this hotel touting itself as a     what a joke  They have no concept of how to treat guests  Nobody ever did open up a map and show me where I was or how to get to anything  When I asked one of the Asian front desk clerks where the gold souk was at  she did not speak English very well  and made gestures with her hands  The whole cc debaucle seemed like a ploy to hold me hostage and get me to spend   only on their restaurants  The angry desk clerk made a big deal of telling me that he would put  quot pay cash only  quot  if I wanted anything from the hotel  The whole thing was just very fishy and unprofessional to me  As far as Dubai  it s the  quot Emperor where s no clothes quot  as far as I m concerned  Ugly buildings  People seemed depressed  amp  unhappy  Like going to a milltown where people are just working to send   home  Since     are Indians  Shri Lankins  Phillopenos  there was no local scene  I have nothing against immigrants   amp  I would like to go to some of those places  but I just found Dubai very depressing  The museum was hokey  amp  people just seemed angry to me  The hop on bus  the guide just walked away while I was trying to get info from her  Plus  they seemed like aggressive  Almost every stop there was someone getting on the bus asking to see our tickets  amp  making a big deal about  quot no ticket  no ride  quot  Dubai just seemed like a black hole where   was dumped in  with no transit system  everything was far away   amp  it had none of the glitz which I thought   amp  virtually no history  Sorry  but I couldn t wait to leave Dubai or this hotel  
N =>   Over Rated We choose this hotel by it s reviews and also because it had availabilty over eid  the hotel looked lovely and a great location to see all the sights but this was not the case  when asking the reception what the area had to offer she couldn t offer any information and failed to give us a map of the area  eventhough the Dubai Museum was across the road      as to the complimentary fruit and dates on arrival we didn t get any  the room was nice view wasn t  pool very small more than   people in it would feel crowded  jacuzzi you had to pay extra to use it  all in all i wouldn t recommend this hotel  The four star rating is over rated for this hotel  
N =>  great location  We had a brief stopover in Dubai on our way to Egypt and we were excited to see how Dubai had changed in the years since we had left after living there          We wanted to stay near some of the older historic areas and we picked the Arabian Courtyard for its location  We were very happy with the hotel  We booked an upgrade room on their website which gave us breakfast included  access to the business center  which was nice for free internet and drinks and canapes  which substituted for dinner after a large  late lunch  We liked the proximity to the water taxis to cross the creek to the markets  I loved walking around the bastakia area  just down the street from the hotel  Beautiful architecture    and it was so nice to see a little bit of the old Dubai character still around  It was nice to have the museum and things to do within walking distance of the hotel  so we didn t have to take a taxi everywhere  though taxis are very cheap  We thought the room was fine  though the roll away bed for my son was quite hard and uncomfortable  We really enjoyed the breakfast and thought there was plenty of variety  
N =>  Excellent hotel We stayed at the arabian Courtyard and have to say we had a fantastic time  This hotel is situated in the old part of Dubai  You can get to the creek within a   min walk  You can take a small boat across the creek where you will find the Gold Souk  I cannot fault the hotel  Everything eceptionally clean  amp  all staff were very helpful  Nothing was too much trouble  I throroughly recommend you eat in this hotel as the food is exceptional whether it be the breakfast  chinese or at the Sherlock Holmes pub  Beware the meals are huge  If you dont fancy anything there you can find a Kentucky   mins walk away  This place is fantastic as you get to see all the culture but the doorman will call you a taxi and take you to the state of the art places such as The Burg  amp  the great shopping centres  amp  Atlantic Hotel  People are so friendly  amp  its so safe  I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone  I also recommend going on desert safari  Absloute delight  I really want to go back in two years time  Also you can book a free bus from the hotel to take you to the beach  It costs   dirham to get in but well worth it  The bus will then pick you back up  amp  back to hotel  The spa in hotel will supply you with a towel  amp  beach pack free of charge  
N =>   Business Dinner I hosted a business dinner here for    executives in ober  Must admit  I was a bit nervous given that it was  only  a four star hotel  This group is used to    rated hotels restaurants  The reason I went with this venue is location  We wanted to incorporate the Dubai Museum into our trip and since it was directly across the street  it made it an ideal choice  Our dinner was a great success  We used the courtyard by the pool for our cocktail reception  The staff did a wonderful job in transforming this poolside area into a charming environment for the guests to enjoy drinks and appetizers before dinner  And although it was hot  I was surprised how many people chose to linger out there  The food was good  not incredible  but given the cost  it was fine  Everyone seemed to enjoy it  Of all the restaurants we visited in Dubai  the staff at the Arabian Courtyard were the most hospitable and efficient  They really rolled out the red carpet for us  
N =>   LOVED THIS HOTEL my hubby and i stayed here for   nights   from the moment we checked in to checking out everything went brillwe had a lovely room at above the pool area   you could hear the call for prayers from the nearby mosque here which we lovedthe room was very spacious and clean   the aircon was brill and the bed was sooooo comfy   very high thread count beddingthe breakfast was lovely with everything you could want and more it was ramadan when we were there so the indian restaurant was closed but we tried the thai chinese and it was lovely and well priced and the sherlock holmes bar was good for a light bite and a drink or two  again well pricedthe pool area was quite small   but we couldn t complain we had the whole area to ourselves every afternoon   it was like having a private pool in a villa   we had coffee in the ahlan lounge everyday   they do lovely cakes as well   not good for the waist line though  so be warned   the staff were all polite and willing to help but not intrusive we booked a couple of trips including a desert safari and we did the big bus tour which stops over the road   good value for money although the beach tour seemed over longwe also walked to the abra station grom the hotel and went to the gold souks in deira   we walked back through the tunnel and walked round past the heritage centre then back up to the hotel  we felt completly safe although very very hot   take some water out with you we shopped nearby to hotel and got some fantastic silk bedding   worth having a look locally instead of just doing the mallsi thought dubai was fantastic and would stay at the arabian courtyard again  in fact i ve been looking to book for     happy holidays to you all    
N =>  very good This is an ideally situated hotel in the old town off Dubai  The rooms are large with all amenities  our air con was not working and we had to move rooms which was a bit of hasle  It was ramadan while we where there and this was a bit strange but that is there religion  The breakfast was fine loads of choice  They put on a courtesy bus to the beach which was perfect  it did t seem long but was fine has it was hot  There was always taxi s outside and this would be only a few pounds to get back to the hotel  We used Taxi s alot you go for miles and it s only      pound  there meter stops when they stop so bargin  we walked to the creek and went to the museum which was interesting  We also took the boat over the creek which was an experience  we booked a table at the Burj hotel but we did this indepedantly and this is a must in Dubai  We also ate at the Renassaince Hotel spice island and would recomment this also  The pub in the hotel was good  Shopping was dissapponting but enjoyed the whole exoeraince of Dubai and would go back for no more tha   days  
N =>  A Little Over Priced For   Star Just got back from AC  was there for   week during ramadan which i was fully aware off  on arrival at  am  had previously requested early check in due to overnight flight and this was on all documentation  had to wait in cafe area no room ready  not a good start and not even a welcome drink or coffee Room wasa standard room big enough and clean  as i was half board the breakfast was buffet with a good selection  dinner was also buffet but a bit repetitive  complimentary bus to beach only once a day with return at lunch time  Every body has stated pool was small and i have to agree  also it gets shaded early afternoon  starbucks coffee shop with hiked up prices  i thought the benefit of going  star instead of  star would be in the drinks etc but no pub prices for soft drinks and alcohol i thought were overpriced given that you wer ent exactly in luxurious surrounding  Positives though was a good location  most expensive taxis were to the atlantis and mall of emirates about     and      Staff were very nice and for the bargain price i paid i think i got value for money  
N =>   Just about meets   star rating  The hotel is quite old but reasonably maintained  There was no  welcome  drink  which was a disappointment  Room cleanliness varies with each housekeeper  Kingsize bed was very comfortable  Drinks in their pub are overpriced  Buffet breakfast is good  My only complaint is the stale damp air smell when you enter room      
N =>   Good Hotel in nice location We booked to go to the Arabian Courtyard after reading good reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed  The hotel is located in a busy part of Dubai about    m away from Dubai creek and within easy reach of most of Dubais tourist attractions  We arrived at the hotel early in the morning and check in was not until      so we had to pay to check in early which disappointed me a little after a night flight but the room was fine once we had got in Staff and facilities were great and the air conditioning saved us from the     temps outside  Great alternative to some of the more expensive Dubai hotels  
N =>   Great location executive room not worth the extra money We loved the setting of the room  very exotic  We stayed in an executive room on the top floor  but unfortunately we were given a room right under the ventilation compressors which made it extremely noisy  Also  we were looking forward to the executive breakfast  but it was closed during our stay so we had to eat the regular breakfast  Furthermore  evening canapees and drinks were only available during late afternoon  so we never got to take advantage of them  All in all  the executive room upgrade was not worth the money during this stay The check in receptionist was also very rude  however the rest of the staff was really nice and attentative All that being said  we enjoyed our stay in the hotel  but mainly because of the location  It s such a cozy neighbourhood and I am sure that other hotels of the same standard are much more expensive  
N =>   Do not stay here if you arrive before check in time  Having stayed at this hotel a few years ago and encountering a positive experience i decided to stay at this hotel again  However within minutes of arriving at this hotel i knew i had made the wrong choice Our transfer from the hotel arrived on time  We arrived at the hotel at  am and check in time was not until  pm  We were not given any indication of how long it would be until a room would be available In addition a welcome drink was not provided neither was any other facility  We sat in reception for the next few hours just waiting until a room would be ready  We were finally given   room out of the   booked   hours later  Despite our non smoking room request  we were given a smoking room with an absolutely putrid smell  However after a long flight  having a room seemed better than not having anything at all We were told a second room would be available on the same floor as our first if we waited a few hours longer  After agreeing to this wait  we were later disappointed  Despite having waited until  pm for our second room  we were not given rooms on the same floor The service in the hotel has all deteriorated compared to what was experienced a few years ago  The staff  especially the reception staff were rude and unhelpful  The quality of the food offered at breakfast was good  however the service from the staff at the restaurant left a lot to be desired The sauna and steam room is no longer free  Despite it being a    spa hotel  these facilities come at an extra charge All in all a bad experience at the Arabian Courtyard and I would not stay here again when coming to Dubai  
N =>   Not what I expected Booked through expedia and got a great rate after reading other reviews  I then booked a transfer to the hotel directly with the hotel  After numerous emailsto the info email  I receieved no response when booking and later confirming my airport transfer  It was only after trying to contact the Asst  Hotel manager  that i indeed received a response  After a reconfirmation on time and flight details  i was disappointed to find the hotel transfer vehcle or rep nowhere in sight after landing late  After checking with airport info to try and locate him  I decided to take a taxi almost an hour later On arrival to the hotel  we were welcomed warmly no assistance with our baggage was ofered till after check in  Welcome drinks while checking in were a nice touch and staff were realtively friendly  The situation about the transfer was explained  but no apology offered  We were then shown to our room  nicely upgraded to one with a view of the Dubai Museum  Staff helped to take up luggage and pointed out various features of the room Once in he room  we recieved a phonecall  saying that the hotel rep was at the airport to pick us up  asking how we got to the hotel  after explaining the situation to the receptionsist on check in  after    minutes  a fruit basket was brought up to the room despite one already placed in the room earlier  Rooms are relatively large  good ammenities and nice bathrooms  Rooms were spotless and tidy Wakeup calls were prompt and breakfast was adequate  No member of the breakfast staff made any attempt to explain the buffet and offer orders for eggs not on buffet  They did seem a it irritated when i asked for an apple juice not on the buffet and they had to walk to get it  A passing manager greeted us with a simple morning  All in all it was OK Next night  rooms werent turned down with chocolates etc  but we never had the energy to complain  Very early check out was swift although besides taking room number  no other communication was made  I asked are we done and they said yes  That was my goodbye  A local taxi was called and that was the end of my stay at the Arabian Courtyard  The hotel has huge potential  but I would think twice about staying there on my next trip   Dubai  
N =>   Great Hotel   Great Staff   Great Holiday I cannot speak highly enough of the staff at the Arabian Courtyard  From the very welcome mango juice at check in through to the speedy checkout  Nothing was too much trouble  The hotel itself was immaculate   the rooms cleaned  towels and sheets changed daily and all done without any interruption to your time thanks to the electronic  do not disturb  console by the bed  We ate at the Mumtaz Indian restaurant twice the food was fantastic  best Lamb biryani I ve ever had     and they treated us like royalty even giving the pretty lady  ha  me    a rose as we left  The Tex Mex diner again served up excellent Burritos and the Boys and Girls who worked in the Sherlock Holmes Pub made us feel so welcome that we partook most nights before going back to our  free upgrade  room Our   night stay went without incident or upset and I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone  My husband and I will definitely stay there again when we return to Dubai  
N =>  Mixed response I ve said it before in one of my reviews that I believe in the gospel of Tripadvisor  The reviews are a great tool to make sure you get what you expect based on the feedback from others   positive and negative  My wife and I traveled on Emirates from South Africa to New York City and was offered a great stopover package  Based on the reviews of this hotel we decided to stay at the Arabian Courtyard  We arrived from New York City just after   in the morning and after all the normal administative processes  were in the hotel just after        The hotel keeps a policy of checking out at    and check in is at   in the afternoon  A number of people mentioned on Tripadvisor how they were allowed to check in earlier and even how they were upgraded  We were told to hang around until our designated room becomes available  We decided to visit the Dubai Museum across the road in the meantime and upon our return after    was informed that our room has still not been vacated   after the lady at reception could not remember me  So we sat in the Ahlan Lounge  At around        in my jet lagged state  I inquired again about my room and was told by the same lady  who again could not remember me  that  quot You must remember that check in time is after   in the afternoon quot   Yes I knew  but my problem was that I thought she knew I was sitting and waiting  I would have expected her to use her initiative and arrange for prompt cleaning of the room and not make me feel insignificant and having me wait longer than really necessary  Then I learned that I was booked into a smoking room despite my specific indication for a non smoking room  I did not take this offer up after she proposed that the room be  quot sprayed quot  whereafter I was offered a twin room  I asked to speak to the General Manager  a Mr Habib who declined my request  Eventually at the official check in time I was given my room   this time a double non smoking room  The rest of the stay was okay for the calibre of hotel the Arabian Courtyard is  by my standards definitely not four star as they claim to be    The rooms are good and clean and the bed was comfortable  The resident restaurants are fine with the exception of the Sherlock Holmes Pub  This restaurant had the honor of serving me with the worst steak I have ever had and my wife almost broke a tooth on the pizza crust The hotel staff are not friendly at all and my greetings were never acknowledged  except for the doormen   My check in receptionist could hardly speak English and so did most of the other staff  Don t try the concierge either  Apart from us being given the wrong directions to the Abra station  I was told to make a phone call from my room to confirm my airport transfer when I approached the concierge desk to arrange this   That was after he finished his private conversation on his cellphone  I assume the reason for the indifferent treatment I received was because my accommodation was part of the stopover package from Emirates Airlines which offered me this hotel at a discounted rate  I say this  as I witnessed while checking out on the   th of e  how another couple was accommodated to check in just after       in the morning  They were obviously paying the full rate and not the Emirates stopover rate   The lady also mentioned like me that they ve spent the whole previous night on a plane   It should be mentioned that I never got the impression that the hotel was very full during our stay  based on the number of people at breakfast and in the restaurants in the evenings  I stand to be corrected    Apart from the fact that this hotel is actually quite decent  I would not recommend it to my worst enemy due to the way I was treated by the hotel staff and the hotel General Manager who completely ignored my request to see him  Really not worth it at all  In a city that prides itself on being a premier tourist destination  you can certainly find a better four star hotel at the same rate  
N =>   Amazing place I am disappointed to see this hotel had slipped down the rankings as it really was an excellent place to stay  Fantastic location  great Arabic rooms  friendly staff  efficient  clean and great restaurants  I went to Dubai  to spend quality time with my mum and it was the ideal place to stay  We went to the in house Spa and had wonderful treatments at reasonable prices  The hotel itself was also fantastic value  the best thing to do is book directly from the hotel website  I especially loved the way you could see the old buildings from the hotel wondow  which made it even better  Really I have nothing bad to say and hope you have a good trip  
N =>   Would highly recommend Wonderful hotel which due to its proximity to the Dubai Museum means taxis always know where to drop you off which is a big bonus in ever changing Dubai   Staff are always friendly without needing to be tipped all the time On arrival we were upgraded to an executive room       on the non smoking eighth floor without charge and with a stunning view of the Dubai museum   On my wifes birthday and again on our wedding anniversary a complimentary cake and bottle of wine was delivered with the compliments of the house  Breakfast was taken on the executive floor and was reasonable  The choice was excellent but beef bacon and veal sausages are not the same as the real thing  this is not a criticism of the hotel as it could be said for all hotels in Dubai All in all I would go back tomorrow and would thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone not requiring a  beach  holiday  
N =>   very clean comfortable hotel i have just returned from a week long stay at the arabian court hotel and spa  We did not arrive until      am and the hotel staff were quick to induct us and show us to our room  on arrival we were upgraded to our surprise with no hidden extras  The staff were helpful and if you are staying in dubai on a budget this hotel offers everything you could need  A bar  restaurant  chinese and indian restaurants which served reasonable priced food  The hotel rooms are cleaned daily and towels and a linen change were undertaken every day  which also included refills on water  shampoos etc  There was no noise from surrounding rooms or the bar  I really couldnt have asked for a nicer hotel at the price  we opted to stay for a further night due to airport flights and all was accommodated  I would def stay in this hotel again  
N =>   Smells like a wet dog Ugh  thank God we stayed in this hotel for only one night  Thanks to other people s positive comments  travel brochure s praises and categorization of four stars I had a high hopes for Arabian Courtyard At first I noticed nice location near Dubai Creek  yeah  But the first disappoiment came immediately in the reception  We had just stay few nights in Fujairah  hotel Le Meridien Al Aqah  and falled in love with the amazingly friendly staff  So we thought that most arabians are helpful and nice  But this hotel changed our views  Woman at the reception was rude  at first she said that there was a quiet weekend in the hotel  so most of the rooms were empty  But when we asked can we keep our room for four extra hours because of our flight  she looked at us very surprised and said that we must pay     dirham extra  quot This is a popular hotel and we can t say  no  we don t have any rooms  because of you quot    That was a quite weird but finally we promised to pay     dirham  And then she started to claim that the total sum was     dirham  So we gave up and went to our room Room was an arabian stylished which was okay  but the bathroom was sooooo small  And the view from our window was depressing  The worst thing was the awful smell  like a mix of cigarette  mould and wet dog  Horrible  Our room was somehow exclusive   And I don t want even know what the standard room was like We didn t want to eat in any of the hotel s restaurants after our visit in the cafe bar or something on the seventh floor  We read in some information paper that there would have been served cookies  We waited for those biscuits for about half an hour and what we got  three ridiculous tiny cookies  And when we went to the same bar in the evening  there was still something more terrible  Bar was full of people who were tired and impatient and the bartender was   Can t find words to describe him  For example  he made one drink for fifteen minutes  Still today I can t understand why the hotel took him to work here   I think it would suit him better to work in an old people s home I don t recommed this hotel to anyone and I think it s overrated  
N =>  Just OK We stayed here only one night and for that we are grateful  On arrival we discovered our room not ready  After a long drive in the heat this was more than disappointing as we only had    hours in Dubai and wanted to make the most of it  The chap on reception was not at all apologetic and in fact smirked as we asked why it was not ready for the  pm check in we requested  He just kept telling us to sit down  Never at any stage were we offered a coffee or snack while we waited  We then observed we were not the only ones waiting as several others were in the same boat  Eventually our room was ready and again  no apology for delay  The rooms are average and as ours faced the front  very noisy  Ours smelt of stale smoke  We couldn t use the bar as children are not allowed in  the restaurant staff were very polite but did forget the childrens meal which mean we were well finished before they could start so it was a long long meal  The pool was tiny   we never set foot in it but just took a look  In short  its an ok hotel but not great by any means  The staff generally are very pleasant and the girl on reception when we checked out was lovely but the check in was a bad memory  Would I stay there again  No  The chap outside hailing taxis  etc  was very helpful and polite also  
N =>  Good first impression   but not top score because of staff The hotel was great   friendly and helpful  The disappointment was that a pair of new boots that I bought in Dubai were missing at the day we were leaving  Upgraded room because we arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready   we got the upgraded room after   hours waiting in the coffeebar The spa was top with very good service  Very  very good breakfast buffet  Recommend the hotel   but keep valuable things in locked suitcase or in safe Eileen 
N =>  Superb service great location This hotel is in a superb location  minutes from the creek   amp  water taxi s   amp  old town  done the beach before   Hop on hop off tour bus picks up opposite hotel next to museum  Good choice of restaurants  amp  bar  food  amp  service very good   Room large  clean  amp  airy with all extras  view from rooms at rear of hotel rather naff  Would recommend for city stay  unable to find fault Phil Harris  Maesteg  UK  
N =>   we loved it We spent a few nights at the Arabian Courtyard over the New Year period We loved it  Our room was not ready when we arrived at the hotel in the morning so we were offered a complimentary upgrade to a room on the Executive Floor with access to the Executive Lounge offering unlimited free drinks and snacks in the evening  Could we have asked for more  Oh  yes  on my friend s birthday we were surprised with a gorgeous birthday cake and a bottle of wine  Brilliant The room was nice  large and bright  with wooden floor and teak furniture  commanding a sweeping view over downtown Dubai and the Creek  Double glazed windows reduce street noise to a minimum  The bathroom was somewhat small but very well appointed  Virtually everything of interest in Bur Dubai is a short hop away  the Museum  right opposite the hotel   the Old Souk  the Bastakiya Quarter  and the Creek  Even the BurJuman shopping mall is within reasonable walking distance  Those after a beach holiday should betterlook elsewhere though  Jumeirah Beach is a long  long way  it took us about one hour to reach Madinat Jumeirah by taxi   Breakfast was lovely  even if sometimes the small restaurant felt slightly crowded  We were really impressed by the variety and quality of the buffet  definitely something to look forward to first thing in the morning  There was even a non halal section with pork products fornon Muslims  But the best asset of the hotel has to be its staff  From the moment we checked in we felt welcome and looked after  and throughout our stay we got the impression our custom was highly valued  As a result  we would not hesitate to stay at the Arabian Courtyard again  or recommend it to anyone looking for reasonably priced quality accommodation right in downtown Dubai  
N =>   good location but poor service A friend and i spent   days at the Ariabian Courtyard in early uary  Having spent   days at the otel we were really pleased with the location   it was great to be able to walk to the souk and abra station and just see a little of proper Dubai life  The main areas of the hotel seemed a little dated  but our room looked like it had been refurbished and was done out very nicely  The room was a good size and we looked directly out over the Dubai museum  There was a window in the room which we were unable to shut ourselves as it didn t have a fixed handle  On our way out to dinner we asked for the window to be shut to block out some of the street noise  On our return it was still open and it took   more calls before someone came to close it  The problem with service was repeated again and again  After   nights of struggling to sleep due to a strange squeaking noise in the room  I couldn t work out if it was a mouse or the air conditioning  I asked to move rooms  I spoke to a receptionist in the morning before we headed out for the day about this   she told me the hotel was full  but I pointed out that it was   am  and from the pile of prepared bills in front of her i could see that there were plenty of people checking out  We told her that our bags were packed and asked if they could be moved to our new room  On our return that evening  we found that we had not been moved and the new receptionist had no record of our request  She suggested that they send housekeeping to investigate the noise  I explained that as you only heard it in the middle of the night there wasn t much point  and again asked to be moved  We were told a room would be available in an hour  so went to shower in our old room ahead of dinner reservations  After an hour  we had not heard anything and contacted reception   it took speaking to a few people to be told that the bellboy was on our way up with the new room keys and to move our bags     minutes later we were still waiting  and after even more phone calls we were still waiting  I eventually had to go and track the bellboy down before we could move  After all that we returned that evening to find that our new room was directly above the function room  where a party was going on with loud music blaring until the early hours  and that there was still a strange squeaking noise in the room in the middle of the night  On top of this  the wooden floors combined with a connecting door meant we could hear someone in the next room shuffling round half the night and hear very clearly  they may as well have been standing in our room  the conversation they were having early the next morning  If it hadn t been such a complete hassle the previous day  I d have moved rooms again The pool at the hotel was a real disapointment   and you could see why there was only a very limited shot of it on the website  Although there weren t many sunbeds  we found that it wasn t busy so this wasn t an issue  but the pool itself was as hot as a bath  I m all for heated pools  but it would have been nice if it had just been slightly refreshing when you wanted to take a break from the sun  We found that the cold water in the room was also always warm  so maybe it s an issue with the water supply to the hotel  The bar by the pool was mostly unmanned  you had to phone through your order if there was no one there  and service could be quite slow  We were told on Friday afternoon that it would be difficult to serve us food  quot because it s Friday and things are all over the place quot    we were also told that it would be a problem to get us drinks  again because it was Friday  We said we d wait  at which point the barman managed wtih no trouble at all to pour us a couple of drinks   we couldn t even begin to work out why it would have been an issue in the first place  given that he was standing at the bar  We visited the Sherlock Holmes bar one evening  which was a totally unpleasant experience   the thick fog of smoke was unbearable   even for my friend who s a smoker  and the whole bar was just very tired and dated  We ate dinner in the Mexican restaurant one evening   the food was ok with massive portions  although the service was very slow Checking out was another slow process   my bill had not been prepared in advance  and it took the receptionist a while to track down various bits of paper that she needed  I think I was sat at the desk for about   mins in all which is not what you need when you are leaving to catch a flight  I think I would have enjoyed my stay at the Arabian Courtyard and recommended it to others if if hadn t been for the service   it really let the hotel down and meant that the other issues we had were just made worse by how they were handled  
N =>  Arabian Courtyard   somewhat disappointing Arabian Courtyard was sold as a   star hotel however I feel that is somewhat generous The carpets in the hotel have clearly seen better days although much of the other furnishings are nice  The bedrooms are generously enough proportioned however there was holes in the bedding which was not acceptable and the bathrooms are in definite need of refurbishment The pool area was smaller than represented with limited beds available  Service was also much poorer than I have seen at other Dubai hotals Despite booking a non smoking room a smoking room was provided and this was covered up by very generous use of air freshner which only served to give a chemical odour in the room for hours    On checking in the front desk receptionist was less than helpful but this was not the case with all the staff   and our request for an early check in   that had been made on several occasions  went unheeded   I would even have appreciated an email from the hotel confirming this was not possible but that was not received either despite contacting the hotel before departing for Dubai   Overall the quality of the stay was less than the usually high standard we have received in the region and we would choose alternative accommodation next time  
N =>  Good Value for Money I stayed at this hotel on my last day in Dubai due to its proximity to several places I wished to visit  My bags were taken from the taxi upon arrival and I was directed to reception where I was given a seat and a refreshing fruit juice  My room was not ready  check in is    it was     but this was not a problem for me since I wanted to grab lunch and head for the museum Check in was a bit slowish  but to be fair to the hotel  I find that to be the case in the majority of hotels in Dubai  I headed to Sherlock Holmes where I had the place to myself  plenty of newspapers to choose from and ordered lunch which was freshly prepared  plentiful  tasty and good value  When I finished up  I headed down to the lobby and was going to leave when I was stopped and informed that my room was ready  The girl behind the counter apologized for the delay  she had nothing to apologize for since I was the one who was early   and told me that she had upgraded me I popped up to the room which was nice and clean  It was also overlooking the museum  Yes  as others have stated  the bathroom is a bit on the small side  but that is a very powerful shower   so no complaints from me  The TV seems to cater more towards Euro  more French programs than US British   but sufficient for my length of stay  Beds are clean and comfortable  I think the closets are a bit narrow  but since I had little to hang  it was not a bother to me  The electric kettle was another life saver and one which I made good use of The spa  which I used later in the evening  has one of the most extensive opening hours which I have ever encountered  Try out the massage chairs in the waiting room  I had a facial  which while the girl was really lovely  I would not recommend it  Not one of the best facials in the world   but to me   that is more to do with lack of training and technique  All in all  the spa is a nice place  and I believe that it is more geared towards massages The gym is well equipped and the roof deck area is adequate with a good amount of loungers  The pool is small  but seems fine to me as it is in a city location When I got up to leave in the morning  I could clearly hear the call to prayers from the mosque beyond the museum   but that added to the experience to me  I don t know if you would be woken up from it if you were a light sleeper  On check out  this was about      a m    a bill was not ready for me to review  I told the man that I had charged my lunch and the spa to the room  It was not on the bill  I figure I will see that on my statement on Monday All in all  to me  it was a good location  with good value  adequate comfort  helpful staff  
N =>   Astonishingly bad start I ll start with the good The room we ended up with was fine  certainly had an Arabian style  The location was good  right next to the Dubai museum and close to Dubai creek  The free sowing kit was of a very high standard And then the bad We had booked an airport transfer through the hotel  We came through arrivals at about       We d actually booked that night at the Arabian Courtyard as we knew we d need a shower and some sleep  No airport transfer was waiting for us  We phoned the hotel and the response was not very helpful and they told us to get a taxi  Thankfully they didn t charge us for this We arrived at the hotel at      and then attempted to check in  There were a number of people checking out so we were asked to wait a moment and we were given a drink while we waited  We waited about    minutes and then were able to check in  We mentioned the lack of transport from the airport and the staff were a bit indifferent  We spent about    minutes at the reception desk  Once we d finished at reception we were told our luggage would be taken up to the room  Once we got to the room we found it was a smoking room and absolutely stank of smoke  Since we had reserved a non smoking room  I went back to reception see if we could get another room  I think the duty manager realised we had been waiting a while by this time so got us another room which was non smoking  and was possibly an upgrade but I was so tired by this point I hadn t paid too much attention to the first room  I asked if our luggage would be taken to the new room and was told it would be     minutes later the luggage still had not appeared so we phoned the reception and asked where it was  Someone turned up really quickly    wanting to know where our bags were so he could take them away  A further    minutes later our luggage was located and we were reunited with it  Given it was      when we turned up and there were no other people checking in I am at a total loss to explain why it took a full hour to be in our room with our luggage  We might as well have not bothered booking the hotel for the extra night The internet in the room did not work  we had to use the business suite computers instead but after complaining about this we were not charged  
N =>   a great way to celebrate a birthday  My husband and I have just returned from a holiday to Dubai where we stayed at the Arabian Courtyard Hotel and Spa to celebrate my   th birthday  We had a fabulous holiday and I can t thank the hotel enough for making my birthday so special Even though we arrived early in the morning they checked us into our room straight away  We used the hotel transfer both ways from the airport which was cheap and reliable  We couldn t fault the hotel or the staff at all during our weeks stay  The hotel was spotless and in an excellant location making it easy to go out and about  We used the shuttle bus to the beach several occasions and again this was reliable  We ate in three of the onsite restaurants which were all very different but all very good  There were various offers on which also made the hotel a cheap place to eat  We would definatley recommend the hotel and would stay there again if we visit Dubai in the future  
Never Again Never Again  Been there in e this year  I will never go back  The reasons  If you want to see the WHOLE town  not only the old part  location is awful  If you are thinking about renting a car NO WAY this hotel  very complicated and waste of time to reach the hotel and get from there  no parking at the hotel  Even if I advised them  and I booked the previous night   I arrived       AM  our room WAS NOT READY when arriving  but of course they charged that full night  being used the room      hours  We did the checkout at    PM  and they charged us another full night  being used only   hour  but they didnot advise at the moment  they did afterwards  Very small bathrooms and BED CLOTHES WERE DIRTY  and some of them broken  Swiming pool very small  and allmost unusable  Breakfast not that good  and a simple chocolate  is charged apart    Dirhams  Internet very expensive  and we were suggested by OWN HOTEL S PERSONNEL  to go to an Internet Caffe two streets by the hotel  Summing up  NO   STAR HOTEL  unpractical location  horrible client experience   
N =>   Good Hotel We stayed here for   nights before moving on to the Oasis Beach hotel and we are glad we did  It gave us a taste of the real Dubai not just beaches and fancy posh hotels  It is near the Abra station  water taxis  which take you across the creek to the gold and spice souks worth a visit but it gets very hot  The hotel is also accross the road from the museum although we did not go in  Its located on a main road where the car horns never seem to stop honking but i had ear pugs which worked wonders The hotel itself was very functonal and we did not have any problems with service or standard  The only minor fault was we did not request a non smoking room beforehand and we found it very strong smelling on the curtains and cushions etc  We did ask if we could be moved to non smoking but unforunately the hotel was fully booked  We bought some insence from the spice souk to mask the smell  We ate in the Silk route chinese restuarant and sat on the outside terrace overlooking museum which was nice and we also ate in the Sherlock Homes pub which was average  They have a live singer every evening Its worth getting a taxi to the nearby Burjuman Mall for other eating options and to visit all the designer shops Gucci  Prada  Tiffany and Saks Fifth Avenue and everything else you can think of   nothing to do with the fact i was bought a diamond engagement ring here  The swimming pool is small with only a few beds  more of a plunge pool which we didn t use Overall we enjoyed our stay here but   days was enough  
N =>   Lovely Hotel   friendly staff We went to Dubai for our first wedding anniversary for six daysWe were not fussed on a beach hotel as we wanted to see Dubai itself that s why after reading reviews on this hotel on this website we thought to try it out  Got to say the hotel is really nice  The receptionists are friendly  as it was our anniversary we were upgraded to a deluxe room for free with a museum view  Even though the room was facing outside  we couldn t hear any noise from the traffic or even we couldn t hear the Azaan  They are polite and very helpfulThe room was clean and a maid came everyday to make up our room which we were impressed with  Breakfast was included in our package and s served from      to       and it has a large variety   buffet style  The hotel also offers a coach service to Jumeirah beach free  It leaves the hotel at about      and picks you up from there at     pm   which I would recommend as the taxi people charge a lot  a large amount of our cost went on taxi money  I would recommend hiring a car as Dubai isn t that big and you get to know the streets really quicklyOverall  I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again  
N =>   Authentic   of us went to Dubai     to       I am a wheelchair user and found no reviews that were useful for me in choosing a hotel for this purpose so I decided on the Arabian Courtyard  The reviews were pretty good and it was reasonable  It was advertised as wheelchair friendly and it was except for the bathroom  There was no shower just a bath with one  only  grabrail  This complys with the local regulations and they say allows the room to be classed as accessible  It certainly would not meet the European standard  As the bath was not suitable for me it was a week of me having to wash with a sponge etc    on the whole   s  reasonable and flexible as all   of us  girls  shared a room  One of the party left to embark on her Australia trip and they let us stay in the same room   Clean  Great indian restrurant  Breakfast included but room service b fast was good  amp  reasonable   Close to the textile markets  Staff very helpful in securing taxis etc   assisting with the wheelchair  Spa was superb  Lobby coffee shop excellent for a tea coffee pastry  amp  v good  plesant service    Opposite the Museum which was well worth a visit  s noisy   we were over the indian restruant and indian music was audible until  am   The restruant  not Thai or indian   the other one  eventhough was OK at breakfast was not good for dinner  The computer time could have been more flexible  eg a charge per day rather than per hour as we did need to use  and were charged  up to three times a day  Pool not accessible   steps up  and sporadic food service there eventhough there is a menu   Hairdresser  which I had to use due to lack of shower     was expensive and suspiciously quiet             Overall it probably wasn t the best hotel for me as a wheelchair user but I do think it was good for the price  Some of the other hotels we visited felt like we were on a film set whereas there was an authenticity to the Arabian C  
N =>   Nice Hotel Me and my friend returned from this hotel a week ago  The hotel itself was very nice I did nt have any complaints about it  The restaurants were very good especially the indian restaurant called The Mumtaz  it had live classical music and dancers on Saturday nights All the staff were very friendly and helpful  There were tea and coffee facilities in your room and they left you some Oreo biscuits and bottled water each day as well  We found the breakfast buffet was good and catered for everyones tastes  we especially enjoyed the fresh omelettes that were cooked in front of you Our room was on the  nd floor and we had a view of the muesuem  we could hear traffic noise but it was not really loud that we could not sleep  The pool was small but we did not use it we went to the beach instead  The hotel gives you beach packs to take to the beach which was very handy The only thing that I didnt like was probably the location  It was not on the nicer side of Dubai  Also because it was far from the beach or shopping districts we found that if we were trying to get a taxi back to our hotel after around      pm alot of the drivers did not want to do the journey as it was quite far out and has alot of traffic in the area  The taxi drivers are normally finishing their shift and want to get home so one evening we had a real problem trying to get any taxi driver to take us back I would stay at this hotel again if I had to but would probably pick a different hotel because I would like to be in a more central location  
N => nice hotel Nice hotel  the chinese restaurant was really nice   the rooms were tidy as well i would stay in this hotel again  staff were friendly as well  the pool was a bit small and not enough sunbeds there  
N =>   Restaurant review Walking around the souks  we decided we wanted to sample some Lebanese cuisine  A free guidebook we had picked up recommended a restaurant at this hotel and  as it was just across the creek  we thought we d try it  Imagine our disappointment to find that what the guidebook had recommended as a Lebanese restaurant was only small stand in the lobby selling assorted Middle Eastern pastries  We were also amazed to find that the many restaurants in the hotel served Indian or Thai or Chinese or British food  but not Lebanese or any sort of Middle Eastern food  With it getting late  and two small kids in tow  things were not looking good  However  when we confessed our disappointment to the young waiter all on his own in the upstairs  quot coffeeshop quot   with a great view of the Fort   he very kindly suggested that he could arrange for us to order Lebanese food off the room service menu  We did  and it was excellent  The young man made our day  proving that personal initiative is best  We ll certainly stay here on our next visit to Dubai  
N =>   Nice location nice personal bad organisation    Dear all I visited the Arbian Courtyard hotel in Dubai for   nights in ember       Organized and booked the trip in the internet via the hotels com page As I needed a VISA for my wife to enter dubai  I searched for a hotel which helps with the VISA application  Usually something very simple as it is done electronically via the internet by the tour operator or the hotel  On the hotline the Reservation desk promised me to take care of that  The charges would be     Dhs  which is more than the double as stated on the official page at the Arabian Emirates Government page       Dhs   But the pickup at the airport and the way back would be included  Furthermore there were      Dhs  over     Euro  requested as deposit  Also fine  Written permission given by fax with all the necessary details including the credit card numbers So until now nothing was going wrong  Entered the plane from germany and were looking forward for a nice short trip to UAE  a bit shopping and seight seeing When we arrived at the airport  we were looking for the hotel driver to pick us up  all details  flight No  arrival time  etc were given three days in advance and confirmed by the hotel that they would pick us   But after one and a half hours of waiting in the direct sun  we just decided to take a taxi and go there by ourself  Things like that happen  forgetting a date  No big deal  So we arrived there still in good mood  The sun  new exciting city moving  it was still in the morning    Nothing could change our mood  we thought so until this moment   Arriving at the hotel  we were well received  As other visitors experienced and described it in here  they welcomed us with free drinks and offered us to wait in the hotel cafe  as there were many more persons to check in  After the first hour of waiting in the lobby  we decided to have a short lunch in the town and to return after for the  final proceeding for the hotel check in   At round       we arrived back there at the hotel  We filled all the papers as requested and were waiting to receive our hotel room  as we were already really tired due to the overnight flight from germany  But unluckily the guy at the reception informed us that the hotel  which was booked two weeks before  confirmed the day before from their reservation desk  was not availbale  And as the hotel is fully booked  nothing available  But they could upgrate us to the executive suite  which would cost usually      Dhs and we could stay there  if we accept to pay     Dhs more  The executive suits in the Arabian Courtyard hotel are on the  th and  th floor of their building  last ones   If you are spending your night there  you are allowed to use the facilities in this floor  like social room where you can take breakfast in the morning etc But I refused to pay more money as the current rate was already higher than the best offer in the internet  Short discussion  all very friendly  call to the manager  And very unbureocratic  I got the room but with the small exception that I am not allowed to use the extra services in the  th floor  Fine  I was happy  thought now it could start  But unfortunately  the hotel room was not ready to come in  So we were spending another hour in the lobby until we could go upstairs in the room The hotel room itself was in good condition  Nothing to complain  Nice furniture  really clean  Just that there was a real loud noise in the room  I thought first it would be the room airconditioning  But after turning it off manually  the noise was still here  Spending the first night in the room    and you can imagine  the noise did not appear  It wa horrible  A loud noise like of an generator  Next morning  talking to the reception  they told me that the hotel engineer will come upstairs and try to find the reason  He came  took him  sec to tell me  sir this is the main generator of the hote airconditioning which is directly on top of the hotel roof  over your room      I was happy to hear that  He told me  the upper back side of the hotel in the  th floor  their executive suites have this problem  Ok  downstairs again  talking to the manager  really friendly and kind  so got the room changed into the  th floor  Was happy of the kindness some problems as I had to wait until the late evening to get it  But then changed and it was really silent in there  Also clean and nice room  It did not bother me that it was a smoker room and really smelling tought  as the windows cant be opened manually no way of fast changing the air inside   but the noise was away and we were looking forward for another   nights in a quite place to relax   The next nights were really nice  Beside the real too high prices in the hotel for coffee and anything else  everything is fine and in good condition  It is always better to have coffee and breakfast in one of the various places around the hotel  Its nicer cause of the arabian flair  the really cheap prices and the friendly persons The last part of the story started at the night before the check out  By knowing how long it took  a flight early next morning to catch  I began my check out the night before  Some minor problems as the hotel stuff typed wrong numbers in the credit card machine and I paid way to much  all ok  I recognized and they changed it  So  whenever you pay there  check your bills Hotel transfer planned for next morning with the reception  Seems all fine       hotel personel should get the luggage in the room       planned leave to the hotel with the private owned hotel car  Fine  Next morning  all fine  had a good night  the hotel personal did not show up  No problem  for   nights you don t have lots of luggage  Not heavy  Brought it down by myself  But I could alrady wait for it  When comming down there was nothing ready  The hotel driver was not here  the car either   even if we were    min later than planned  fine    Waiting there for the guys to decided who should go to the airport now  They wanted obviously to pick another one at the same time there when going  but the namesign was not ready  So they were showing really hurry to finish and to pay their attention to us  wanting to catch our flight at the airport  Finally we were in the car and they brought us to the airport  As they knew our flight and dates  bringing us directly to terminal   of dubai international airport  But unluckily when being there  the driver away  they told us that we are wrong and have to take a taxi to terminal    That was not funny anymore  as you need to drive with a taxi through the really heavy morning rush hour to come there  But we did it in time  So  ok  All in all you see that they are not the best planners or organizers there  Not for check in nor check out  If you enjoy full service and would like to take care of nothing  I am not recommending you this hotel  There are sure better ones  But it is clean an really has arabian style furniture Which proofed me again the professional skills of the hotel staff  was when checking my credit card statement today  Arabian Courtyard Hotel charged the deposite and took it over      Dhs  Then charged the hotel room with over     Dhs  Charged the visa three times  including once the government   And one funny thing  for which the hotel has no responsibility  the car rental which was organized by the hotel  more expensive but more convenient  should charge     Dhs  but in fact they changed the last   to a   and charged     Dhs  Just watched the original paper  its really a    no way to misinterpret anything  But this it how it got to know them there  if there is an opportunity  well  This is more funny and I am not giving the fault to the hotel So my resum    the hotel is offering a good stay unless you are using the  th floor in the executive suites back side  So I just give you a good advice to persist on other rooms  when paying more for executive rooms   check steadily your credit card bills  the personal is very often not able to make the correct billing   if you plan an early arrival  try to take another flight in order to check in later or just look for another hotel  This can prevent you from many hours waiting in the lobby and asking yourself if they forgot you  By the way  we were not the only ones waitiing  The hotel lobby way every day busy with waiting guests  So there is something wring in the hotel procedures  I dont even think its the hotel personel as they are really trying to be friendly to the guest at any time in the day or the night  And this is not easy when the normal working day lasts   h  So they have my full understanding and I am not complaining about them  But the hotel orginizations itself is all but not efficient nor correct   when you bring time with you  then there is nothing to do wrong I am trying to get my money back  Hope it will not cost me too much negotiations or expensive calls by phone  Just lets hope the best The location of the hotel is ok  There are a lot of shops around  One thing I forgot  I did not use the hotel pool during the days  as we were all day long outside and visiting the town  But in the last night before leaving I tried it out  It has open until      pm  So really something for night owl swimmers    But be aware  The chimney of the hotel owned asian restaurant  which serves really good food  is directly next to the pool  round  m   So at night when there are guest  you can smell while swimming everything they cook      Wishing you nice holidays and hope when you decide to visit this hotel you have more luck  be I am just a real bad example  I am not claiming to give the general picture of the hotel  Just my own experience with my wife there tin 
N =>   Couldn t fault it  Stayed here for   nights in    e this year  It was fab  We arrived early in the morning and were given our room immediately  after enjoying the refreshing drink at check in  The staff were friendly and polite at all times Our room was great  It had that Arabic feel  which is what we wanted  as we had been to Dubai before and our hotels before  although they were nice were too  typical   By this I mean we could have been in NY or London as they were typical hotel rooms Here we had wooden floors  lanterns  chests and nice dark wood furniture  Breakfast was nice  a good choice on offer  The food in the Sherlock Holmes pub was pleasant and good value  Granted the pool was not that big and there was building work going on around the hotel   however  you ll struggle to be more than    metres from a crane or building site in Dubai at the moment  wherever you go We found the the pool was pleasant enough and never that busy   but if it is not for you then book in for the free shuttle bus to the beach   be warned though   it gets a tad on the scorching side at the beach Overall I d recommend this hotel to anybody  
N =>  great service The Arabian Courtyard Hotel Bur Dubai  We have just returned from   nights in this hotel  From the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly and helpful we knew we would enjoy our stay Dubai is wonderful and our hotel helped us in finding any of the attractions we wanted to visit  They also arranged for our desert safari which was thrilling  We used taxis most of the time as it was very humid  these are very cheap and always available The only thing we could fault was that we had upgraded our room and the only difference seemed to be that we had a view of the museum  the bathroom too was dissapointing  very small and the first morning our shower didn t work however we reported it to reception and it was repaired instantly We would reccomend this hotel as it is very central  and as we have said the staff were so friendly  
N => fantastic Stayed here with my hubby for   nights in the executive room  Our stay was fantastic  Enjoyed every minute   The room has a truly arabian feel to it  Breakfast was very nice with a lot to choose from the buffet and omelette made to order if you wanted one  The location was very good  only a few minutes walk to the textile souk and    minutes drive to the gold souk if the traffice was not bad  The staff were very helpful and would go to any length to make sure you were very comfortable  Didnt get the chance to have a meal in the Indian Restaurant but most guests who had used the hotel previously recommended it  The swimming pool was small but nice and the sauna was fantastic  shame could not go in with my hubby as men and women were not allowed in at the same time  Had    minute complimentary massage by the hotel which added a nice touch to the visit  The staff could not do enough for you  The rooms were nice and cleaned everyday  Shuttle to the beach was available and trips were easily booked by the a rep on the reception  All in all  I would definitely use this hotel time and time again  
N =>   not a wink of sleep I was attending a conference in the Bur Dubai area and chose this hotel for it s location  Unfortunately I got no sleep  The hotel was busy with repair works which for some unexplained reason was done throughout the night  I called the night manager and the reception several times to complain about the horrible noise of drilling and hammering Each time they apologised and assured me that it will stop but it did NOT  The drilling continued all night  It was enough to make a person go crazy This hotel seems to care less about peaceful sleep and guest comfort Rooms were nicely furnished but bathroom was small Breakfast was pleasant enough but waitresses were surly I will not be staying at this hotel in the future  
N => Good Value   
N =>   The Best Hotel we have EVER staying in  Perfect Honeymoon  My husband and I staying in the Arabian Court for   days for our honeymoon and we cannot recommend this hotel enough  It was like a dream  As soon as we arrived we were given a refreshing drink and cold towel   we were  quot bonged in quot  and called us  quot Mr and Mrs Hot quot  which we thought was hillarious We were taken to our room and I received a huge bouquet of flowers to congratulate us on our marriage  We also received a present   a gorgeous photo frame  We were stunned  Our room was huge and beautiful  You could not fault it We were on the half board deal which I would recommend as otherwise you would really spend a fortune  We still spent a considerable amount as alcohol is expensive  The food was the standard of high class restaurants in London  we were incredibly impressed  We had actually booked into Gordon Ramsey s restaurant but cancelled as the food was so amazing here As we were a honeymoon couple the hotel gave us breakfast in bed one morning  It reminded me of the scene in Pretty Woman when Richard Gere orders the whole menu for ia Roberts  We felt so special I could go on and on about how special this hotel is  seriously you must go  The staff really cannot do enough for you  it is amazingly clean and beautiful  Luxury does not even cover it  You could never regret staying here  we cannot wait to go back  
N =>  Best Hotel I have ever visited  This is the best hotel I have stayed at in    years of visiting Dubai  Everything that could be done to ensure you enjoyed your holiday was done without question  All staff members were absolutely fantastic and could not have been more helpful We certainly intend to return  
N =>   Another good trip to Dubai Went to Dubai on   july for    nights  this will be my   trip in   years to the UAE booked it with my respectiful company Value Added Travel  spoke a bloke name of Bobby babs  he recommened this hotel  told me that they had free nights with free half board  the hotel was a   star luxury hotel  trust me he was not wrong  flew with Emirates took my wife and my son    year old  did not know what to expect cause of my son  but when we got there fell in love with the hotel straight away  As we got there there welcoming was excellent  did not feel i was in Dubai  the half board we got was excellent  we could go to any of the three properties restaurants to eat  the food was excellent  it is buffet but excellent  so many choices of food  did not know where to start and where to finish  i recommend this hotel for couples  familys and honeymooners this place is really good  got a lovely view of the palm island  my room was facing the sea  nice breeze in the mornings  staying at this hotel they gave free access to the water park at the Atlantis  took us there complimentary   really good  i would like to thank Value added travel for another real good holiday  espicailly bobby babs and Jake who booked my previous holday to this  
N =>   Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic         Could not fault this holiday in anyway apart from the building works at palm island opposite the hotel beach  This spoils the view from the beach but is only temporary and will probably look as grand as everywhere else when it is finished  I consider my standards to be very high and this exceeded my expectations  If there was something I could add I would like tea making facilities in the room  Typically Britsh   Whilst mentioning typically british  I am finding some of the reviews mentioning brits  amp  Benidorm very offensive  The reviews actually do show that the British have far more manners than some as I have not seen a review written by a brit slating other nationalities in the way we are rudely  amp  reguarly condemmed On a lighter note THE MASHED POTATOES IN THE ARABIAN COURT BUFFET WAS TO DIE FOR              Our party of   adults would like to say a big thank you to the amazing friendly and very helpful staff who made our   day stay so special  We will definately be back  
N =>  Good enough for a short break  Nothing wrong with the physical structure at all  The hotel  the grounds and the beach were fine  The sea wasn t particularly clean  but then there s so much building going on that expecting more would have been unreasonable  The rooms were very comfortable and regularly attended We felt let down by a lack of local knowledge amongst the staff  When you re paying proper   star prices  you expect good local knowledge and you don t expect to struggle to get it  Nobody helped us make the most of our stay Examples  the staff had a curiously relaxed attitude to calling for taxis and we were often left waiting for more than    mins  they gave taxi drivers wrong instructions on two occasions  I could have given them myself but I think they were trying to ingratiate themselves to us  The food we ate in the hotel was of a good standard  but again the service was a little lacklustre  There was little room for taking breakfast outside considering the number of guests  so we usually had to wait for a table  We did not sense any hurry to get us seated  We took an evening meal in the buffet restaurant with a plentiful array of hot and cold food  the fillet steak on offer was tender and delicious  but we had to stop the chef from slicing it thinly and grilling it to a cinder  there was roast beef but no gravy However  I wonder whether my criticisms should be levelled at Dubai as a resort in general  rather than at the hotel  This was our first trip to the area  Could it be that the calibre of the staff is the limiting factor  be I m wrong          
N =>   Good location Good Rooms Bad Attitude Staff Across I would not pick this hotel  Service Attitude is not up to standard  and not on one encounter but multiple satff encounters  
N =>   Still a great hotel Have stopped here many times over the years  Still very good  though we had to complain over the  st room they gave us  due to cig burns on the bed and room smelling of smoke  However all was OK with the new room  Would return  however the sea is not the same since they have built the Palm  No longer feels clean  
N =>   Nothing special with only a stale croissant included for breakfast  The Faulty Towers of Dubai We found Arabian Dreams to be overpriced for what it was  a standard apartment in a fairly unattractive area with lots of messy construction going on around the hotel  The room itself looked to have been renovated in the last few years although was still shabby in some areas  Our bedside lamps had no plugs on the end  just torn cables  and the bath had not been replaced  so was scratched with old with dirty  mouldy grout around the tiles  The bathroom also smelt  Take your own pillow too as you only get one thin one  The towels are also thin and a bit grotty We had no hot water and when a member of staff was unable to fix it we had to be quite firm in order to get moved to another room  They did in the end upgrade us from a studio to a one bedroom apartment  This apartment also had a bad smell in the bathroom  which we think is due to a faulty ventilation system as this is where the stink was coming from in both rooms  I notice other reviewers have had the same problem Breakfast is included but BEWARE  This only means a stale croissant in a plastic packet  and a glass of juice  Everything else you have to pay for  it was approx    for two bowls of cereal and a piece of fruit  I thought this was really misleading  as when we booked we were happy to pay a bit more for this hotel than others as this one stated breakfast was included  For a really geat breakfast  or just a coffee  and free WI FI you can walk a few mins to The Daily Grind just around the corner  turn left out of hotel and then turn right around the front of the big round building at the end   Although only a few KMs to the airport  the traffic is appalling so be aware it can take nearly an hour at peak times to get from the airport to the hotel and vice versa  It s around        dirhams  to get to the airport in a taxi There is a small pool but it was closed for contruction  Classic  
N => Nice hotel even though it is the cheapest in Dubai Booked this as a pre cruise stay  It was functional and sufficient  A little distance to the town  though they had a shuttle bus to a shopping center  This shopping center is one that is more high classed  Breakfast was served as a buffet and delicious  
N =>   If you care for your life don t go there    I went with my friends to watch a football game in their bar and the ceiling broke down on us  it was a real nightmare  everything was crashing down  AC boxes  electricity cables  we had to evacuate through the windows  in every way we could  staff were helpless  actually insisting on us not breaking the windows  although we could have died in there while they were watching people getting injured    In one word    disgusting  I would never set a foot in ther in my life  
N => Three star but they treated us like FOUR star  We took a chance by booking Arabian Park at Dubai Airport for   nights  since we arrived with no reservation   We actually went to two of the hotel accommodation travel agencies right at the airport  amp  got two different prices for the same hotel  We felt we got good value for the money  we paid about      USD   Staff  especially desk clerk  Slavi   amp  the Moroccan deli server whose name escapes me  were especially attentive  All spoke English well  There was a beautiful pool  internet service  cozy bar with snacks  a restaurant     hr  deli  etc   We got wise  amp  ordered hot breakfasts  amp  coffee from the small deli each morning since the restaurant buffet was expensive  approx       and we were on a budget   The area is somewhat out of the way  between the airport and Bar Dubai  but hotel has free shuttle to airport  amp  beautiful Wafi Mall  which was convenient for us  since that s where the Big Bus tour of the city started   Taxis were inexpensive  too  There appear to be lots of empty lots in the area  so give it a few years and this part of town will be as built up as the rest of Dubai  
N =>   OK   but no more I stayed here for a business conference which took place in the Hyatt  but which was charging more than   times the price I paid here    For that price  it wasn t bad  Everything in the hotel is very functional and it really doesn t have any charm  Apart from others attending the same conference as me  most other guest seemed to be tourists  The hotel was very clean and the staff pleasant enough  Check in and check out were laborious and there were numerous minor mistakes which took time to be corrected  The staff seemed to be poorly trained  but were courteous and polite at all times The hotel is in the middle of nowhere  I guess the Hyatt was certainly no more than   km away  but in Dubai  there is no way to walk anywhere  so you are obliged to take taxis  even for the shortest distance  Taxis are reasonably cheap and seemed to be pretty plentiful  
Nice Hotel and Pool I stayed   days in this hotel  It was a nice hotel  outside of Dubai downtown but at the same time very close to everything There is a bus service that takes people to WAFI center     minutes away   From that center there are many things to do  For example  take Dubai Big Bus Tour  Also  hotel provides bus for the beach as well      minutes away   Room   small  clean and with many amenities room  I had nice view of the Dubai downtown  Good TV  good bed and pillows  Also  I really appreciated kettle so you can make tea or coffee Each floor has a place to sit and read some magazines newspapers  they called this area library Pool   Gym   nice small gym with TVs and pool is a good size  but not deep  They have service bringing snacks  food and drinks Front Desk   very nice polite people  Professional staff  I had an easy   fast check in check out I didn t not have all inclusive  but one of the days I went to eat breakfast buffet which they charged     dirhams  or     dollars  For this money I would rather to go eat outside of the hotel  There is a nice Deli Shop that has many salads  sandwiches  drinks  and candy bars  There is always a good variety to choose from  
N =>   Worst Experience Ever From the moment I stepped into this hotel  the people at the reception were hostile  I arrived very tired but my room was not ready so after waiting for more than five hours they eventually gave me a room  This was for smokers but they said  quot take it or leave it quot   The food at the Brasserie is lousy  and they charge you for it  They do not tell you this but at the end they charge you  The gym room is terrible with few types of equipment  There are no entertainments or a place to enjoy  In addition the hotel is isolated and far away from any other place in Dubai  Worst of all  on the last day of my stay they informed me that I do not have a reservation for the seventh day although I made the reservation through an agency  so they kicked me out in a city that I know nobody  They even refused to give me another room claiming that the hotel is totally booked  In conclusion  staying at this hotel was a nightmare 
N =>   ent hotel Arrived at site  oops sorry Dubai on Boxing day  Made the short trip from the airport and arrived at hotel at       hrs  To save money the original plan was to bunk down in the airport  but the airport was very busy so we decided to go to the hotel and try and get in our room early When we arrived and explained our situation we were told we couldn t check in till  pm  which we half expected  So we decided to bite the bullet and just pay for our room  What we didn t expect was that it was full price with no reductions which i thought was a bit steep  We declined the room  The man on reception then told us we were more than welcome to use the library where there was comfy chairs and a TV  so that s what we did and we managed to get some sleep as well After a bit of begging we managed to check in around   am  which i thought was excellent of them There are six lifts  so no need to wait a long time  Rooms are bright and clean exactly like the traveller photos Bathroom is fine and more importantly clean The pool  like many other reviews is in shade virtually all of the day but its heated to about    celsius There is a good bar serving many beers  with a large Stella coming in around    There is absolutely nothing beside the hotel which some may find a chore  But taxis are cheap and plentiful There is a complementary mini bus that takes you to the Wafi shopping center every hour or so and the same bus drops you off at the public beach twice a day All in all a reasonable hotel for the price  
N =>   Nice new hotel with good service level Stayed in Arabian Park for   nights middle of ember       As a whole my impressions are good  it deserves definitely more than   stars  Positive points  Firstly  after a tiring long flight the early check in was greatly appreciated  Rooms are modernly decorated and clean  although not too spacious  not nice area to sit and relax  however not a big problem  A good positive point is the coffee and tea drinks and the daily mineral water supply  Everything is new which is positive point too  Breakfast was very good  not so much variety but it was tasty  Service was very good  staff polite and helpful  Taxis always available from the own taxi park or city taxis dropping clients  There are shuttle buses to airport  beach and nearby mall  Some negative points or recommendations for improvements Hotel is a little bit isolated  all construction area around but at least not far from city center  Rooms are a little bit cold  even the first room i was placed got freezing me and it took too much time to the staff to discover the room a c was not working properly and was only cooling  Anyway  i was moved to another room with normal temperature and properly working a c  The windows of the standard rooms do not open at all  thanx god the air cleaning system was working efficiently  More frequent shuttle bus to beach  and shuttle buses to other malls and city center will make hotel guests more satisfied too  
N =>   An average experience be I m being harsh but a Dubai hotel should tick more boxes than this  The location is terrible  Ok they have buses to the local shopping centre but if you want a beach it s a long way and only   buses to get there each day As for pool it s constantly in the shade  So if you want to get a glow of gold you ll need to look elsewhere ent breakfast  the bar seems smokey shady and no atmosphere The rooms are really solid   modern but a little souless  We booked a double and got a twin  not the end of the world but it started off badly But that s as bad as it gets  if you re just dropping in it ll do  but if you want some Dubai class there is no point in booking this hotel  unless one of those cranes carries it and dumps it in Jurmeimeh   
N =>   Fell in Love with it My agent booked for me this hotel while I was skeptical but I didn t have any choice  I checked the reviews here  amp  I said I will just give it a try  It exceeded my expectations  was very neat  amp  clean  the breakfast was great  amp  the staff there are amazaing  I will definitly go there again  In my openion it worth more than the three stars  On check out they asked me to fill a survey form  and I took the chance to give them some comments regarding my experience  Two days later the manager sent me a detailed e mail discussing my comments and informing me about the actions taken regarding my comments  His behaviour amazed me for sure and showed me how committed they are to satisfy thier customers and that make me feel that I m in good hands whenever I saty there and made me decide not to book anywhere else whenever I plan to visit Dubai again  
N =>   Arabian Park Hotel   slicker than your average Again i was in the same boat as every other man and his dog  about this hotel  as it was my first time in dubai  and trust me this hotel more than exceeded my expectations  upon arrival at  am  me and my mate were cherfully greeted by the luggage guy who took our luggage to our rooms no fuss  there was a little confusion with the booking in process  but apart from then on all was good   the room itself was of a good size for   people with all modern amenities   shower wasnt all that   but we were in a bog standard room  but still all above average than all    hotels I ve been in the UK   you could control the air conditioning to your preference  and also the lighting   one thing as an improvement perhaps  if i was reallllllllly picky  would be to have free internet access at the  quot business centre quot   but overall i would more than recemmond you come to this hotel to stay   a very good     out of       
N =>   The Arabian park Hotel  WHAT A BARGAIN   LUXURY  Well when i saw what   star hotels were like in Dubai and after reading reviews i was very unsure about this hotel especially it was at a cheap price  However when i arrived i was shocked  The hotel was just like a   Star it matches just like our premier Travel Inn OR Travel lodg in the UK it was very clean and everything  marble and a very modern interior  well recomended to anyone             However a lil problem i ahd was the lcoation  ok fair enough taxi s start at about      p but it was not practical as i was on business and have been to Dubai millions of times other than that it is perfect for budget holiday makers it was simply AMAZING      guaranteed  
N =>   In the middle of nowhere Didn t get the   wake up calls I wanted  Took    minutes to get someone up to open my stuck window  Had to ask for ice twice before it was delivered Rogues with regard to the exchange rate  I went in       when the dirham in Dubai was    DHS to     The rate the hotel offered was    HDS for     I paid with my credit card because with all the charges it was still a better exchange than the rogue hotel  I was quoted in USD and wanted to pay in USD   but they said they had to convert to DHS Oh and the airport shuttle never showed up so I had to pay   DHS to get to the hotel from the airport although I phoned them twice asking where it was Good luck   better to stay in Deira  
Never again  
N =>  terrible stay  
N =>   Give It   More Months  
N =>   Wonderful Stay for our First Time in Dubai       We arrived at the Arjaan at  am  Check in at  pm  and were immediately offered breakfast while we waited for our room to be available  Five minutes later  we were shown our first room which had a fabulous view over the Gulf  Sadly  we needed to twin beds for our children and there was a king sized bed but we were swiftly moved to another two bedroom apartment which was HUGE  It had three bathrooms  two bedrooms  kitchen and dining lounge area  The views were incredible and unexpectingly  we also received Arabian sweets  fruit  a beautiful hand made chocolate cake        and a fabulous flower arrangement of white lilies and orchids   WOW  The Staff cannot do enough for you and they all knew our names  Taxis were not a problem as we were on the main road too     I would recommend The Arjaan Hotel Apartments to anyone    
N =>  Exceptional service with excellent amenities I don t normally write reviews for anything  but this hotel just blew our minds so here you go   Our flight to Dubai landed at     am  so we requested an early check in  expecting it to be around   or   am  check in is normally at  pm   So we were delightfully surprised when the hotel concierge told us that our room would be ready in     mins  We were even more surprised when we were told that our room had been upgraded to a premium room  usually costing around      dhs a night   When we walked into our room  we were amazed  The room was very spacious and beautifully presented   we even had our own private pool on our balcony overloking the ocean and the palm    it actually wasn t just a room   it had a kitchen  a dining room  a huge living room    bathrooms  a massive bedroom  and   balconies Everything about the Arjaan was great   especially the service Arjaan is located in Dubai Media City in Jumeirah  so it is quite central to most things  Its about a   minute ride to from the airport  costing around   dhs in an airport taxi  or around   dhs in a normal taxi  we only caught the airport taxi as we had such an early flight into Dubai   Although the hotel is quite central  you still need to catch taxis everywhere as you cannot walk anywhere in Dubai  it is all motorways and construction work  The Emirates Mall  Ibn Battuta Mall  The Souk Matina  Wild Wadi  The Burj Al Arab and Atlantis on The Palm are all very close to the hotel   costing around   dhs in a taxi We also went to the Gold Souk which was definitely an experience  Catch the abras  water taxis  to get to the Gold Souk   it will only set you back   dhs and it is also an experience not to be missed   put on your haggling hat at the gold souk  The Desert Safari is also highly recommended  We had a great time with the sand dune bashing  camel rides  henna tattoos  smoking shisha  and so on  We pre booked the package with Orient Tours  which was a really good company   very well organised  except for when we were confirming our booking in Dubai   that was a bit frustrating  All in all  a very enjoyable trip to Dubai with some much needed sun and warmth  after spending our first Winter in London   
N =>  We recommend it We spent   nights in Arjaan  we paid AED      taxes and service charges not included  I think it was a good value for money  We really liked the hotel  At first we thought it was kind of isolated  away from everything  But then we found out that you very often have that feeling in Dubai because there isn t any street life  no shops or coffee shops  etc  and you have to take a taxi everywhere you go  So it was perfectly fine  The Mall of the Emirates is very close from the hotel  in a taxi  so it was a very good base  from the Mall we took the tourist bus and we enjoyed the ticket for two days   The hotel stuff found taxis for us all the time  But sometimes a very kind man came to us and asked if we needed a taxi  It was a kind of  private taxi  with a meter and everything  He said it was the same price  But no  the meter suddenly was in a bigger hurry than regular taxis  A trip to the Mall was usually AED      but in these taxis it was AED    A couple of times we took those taxis anyway because we didn t want to wait  but otherwise you can say no thank you and wait for a regular one  The hotel is really new  the taxi drivers never heard of it  which it happens to them all the time because they build so many hotels in Dubai   A good landmark was  Media City behind the Radisson Hotel   From there we could guide them because it was a bit tricky to find the main entrance  Because it was so new the room was excellent  very clean and comfortable  When we arrived around four in the afternoon the room was not ready yet and we had to wait almost   min  It would have been nice of them if they offered us a welcome drink or just a glass of water or a tea  There was a living room and a kitchen with all the facilities  but we missed a microwave to heat the breakfast for our child  we were traveling with a    month old baby   The internet was not included in the price of the room and we thought that that is not that nice nowadays  it was fine for some years ago  but today we think it should be included   We stayed in Abu Dhabi before and it was included and we thought that would be the same in Dubai  My husband was taking care of few issues from work and we just bought a couple of hours to log on and we didn t want to spend more in that service The restaurant was ok but not great  One of the waiters explained to us that the real restaurants were not opened yet and there were we were  was only the coffee shop  Then we understood better the menu  The breakfast was not included in the price  We went twice and we were not very happy  The third day we walked to the Radisson and the breakfast was AED   more expensive  We tried and we liked it much more  We thought it was the money worth and for the next days we took breakfast at the Radisson  There is a congress center in the hotel and it looks like some shop will open someday  but at the moment that side it was empty  There is a little place where you can have your manicure and pedicure done and it was very good  The pool was nice and the gym and the rest of the amenities very neat and clean  really nice  too When we left we took a taxi and the hotel stuff loaded our luggage  When we arrived I show a good bump on one of the suitcases  it seems like they closed the boot and they hit the suitcase  It bothered me that they hadn t said a word to us  I wanted to contact the hotel with that issue  I took pictures  but as today I haven t done that because we have been too busy  so I don t know how the hotel management would have react  All in all we enjoyed our stay in the hotel  
N =>  Not as promised The booking service  through an airline  said it was a four star   it is definitely more like a lower end   star  The rooms were large  but skunky dank  Cheap quality beds  pillows  sheets  I had to wait a long time at the airport for them to drive me to the hotel  It is a bit far from the airport  took about    minutes  
N =>  Utter disappointment  We booked joining rooms as we took our children with us  On arrival we were offered rooms on different floors  when that was rejected we had to wait    minutes for other rooms to be made ready  When we finally got to the rooms they were dirty  However  we were being moved the next day We thought that finally we could sleep  but NO a lovely Russian danceclub cabaret was happening on the  th floor and we could hear it on the  st floor  Needless to say I did not get to sleep until the  quot party quot  finished at about  am The following day we requested that our new rooms be ready before we went on the Arabian Adventures tour that afternoon and no excuses just told no it was not possible  I confronted the Arabian Adventures rep at the hotel and explained that I was extremely unhappy with the situation she assured me that the room would be ready by  pm  Ok good  When we turned up at    guess what the room was not ready   no apology  I will admit I did express my displeasure  However  when we arrived at     pm that night after our tour we had been upgraded to a suite  While this was very nice when I queried the reception the staff were rude  basically the impression I got was that they were extremely generous in providing us such accomodation  On check out at     am we could not be provided a copy of the room charges but were given a total  Both my husband and I are very good with figures and knew approx how much it was going to be  however  the room service bill exceeded this Overall not impressed with the service or standard of accommodation  The only positive comment is that it is in an excellent location and one of the Porters was exceptionally nice and helpful  Would I stay there again  never  
N =>  One star is too generous   This is my first review on this site   I ve found it very useful and a good guide to the inside story on hotels  I feel compelled to give feedback on this place as any potential guests should think again  I stayed at the Ascot for one night on business as hotel rooms were in short supply in Dubai because of the Rugby Sevens  A travel agency booked me in   looked fine to me as it was a four star hotel  If I d managed to keep a sense of humour about the whole affair  I could have laughed it off as Dubai s answer to Fawlty Towers  however by     am with no sleep  I was seething When I checked in after a flight from the UK  all I wanted was a shower and some rest  However  the room was disgusting   large patches of damp and mould over the ceiling and walls  There were no towels  so I called down for them   my request was ignored  so it took two further calls and   hours before towels arrived  Then no hot water  I decided to have a cold shower anyway  which filled the bathroom floor up with water because of a leak in the bath  Then a call from reception to ask if the towels had arrived   I told them yes  but no hot water   they said they d send a workman up to fix it  I told them it was too late and not to worry  Five minutes later a workman barges into my room and sets about fixing the shower  I m standing there in a cramped bathroom with a towel on  trying to shave  with this guy uunpacking his tools  I managed to get through to him that I d rather he left to let me shave in peace  Breakfast was interesting   the food was in total darkness as the lights didn t work so you no idea what was what TV didn t work etc  After returning from meetings in the evening  I was looking forward to some sleep   but I hadn t taken onboard that there was a Russian nightclub on the floor above   no sound proofing  so I had to endure the sound of a highheels on a wooden dance dance floor and russian euro pop until three in the morning  I called reception twice at  am and  am   who just lied and said it would finish in    minutes  By      I was in the lobby in my boxer shorts on the verge of a nervous breakdown screaming  Shut the f    up     Not a pretty sight Due to get up at   for meetings  I overslept  but was determined to see the manager in the morning  He kept me waiting for ages  apparently  in a meeting   then after hearing my complaint offered     dirhams compensation  then withdrew the offer as I had booked and paid through an agent  I have staying in many cheap and expensive hotels in my life  but I can catagorically say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in  The prestigious four star sign in the lobby just makes a mockery of the whole system  Beware   
N =>   What a disappointment After a fabulous time in Thailand we opted to stay in Dubai on our way home  The Ascot looked nice and was not extortionately priced I hated it The room was small  cramped and smelly  there had obviously been a leak as the wall behind the TV was discoloured The staff were abrupt with a  quot yes quot  as a greeting  with the exception of the concierge who was great   Breakfast has a large selection but it wasn t overly tastey and I don t like eating with    waiters loitering near my table whipping each plate away just as I finished We didn t eat there in the eveing so I cannot comment but we did go to the  quot pub quot   Waxy O Connors  Described as a buzzing local  it s great if you like beer swilling english football oiks   I can get that at home if I want  and I do not The main mistake we made was going to Dubai during Ramadan  None of the web sites we used to book advised us of the restrictions and the hotel didn t give you any info at all  But no food   drink  even water  in public  in     degrees  between  am and  pm   Not impressed After only one day there I really couldn t wait for my holiday to end and get out of there  Ascot classes itself as     star I think more     would be correct  I will not be going back  
N =>  extreamly disappointed overall impression dark and disappointing  rooms very small  service not of   star standard  hotel   start over rated should be   star  cleanliness poor  gym only available in sister hotel  rooms very small no tea and coffee facility in room  mini bar extreamly dirty overall feel that we have been riped of by hotel  booked in for four star and given   star  We booked on late and only four star available was ascot  For potential holiday makers would recommend that rather than book into this so called four star you would get a better deal for your money some where else  
N =>  very disappointed We were very disappointed with the hotel  especially as we saw some really nice hotels  Our room smelt musty  and we had to fight with housekeeping to get them to open the window  The room was extremely small  and we actually wondered if we had been given a single room instead of a double  However  breakfast was fairly good and the hotel is in a good location for getting around  
N =>  Average hotel at decent price Some friends and I have just returned from the Ascot Hotel  I was very worried after reading the previous review the night before we left   I agree it is not a   star hotel but our room was clean and of decent size  there was no problems with sockets or TV s at all  The staff are excellent  the food was good  the Irish bar was reasonable for drinks      for       pints and   gin  amp  tonic  and it had a good atmosphere There is some building works very close to the hotel  found out hotel is being extended  but apart from   morning out of the   we heard nothing at all but we are good sleepers Also found out that the hotel had just changed hands  so they will no longer take you to the Jebal Ali resort but they do take you to a public beach which was fine with sun beds and parasols to hire  If you wanted it would only cost about          by taxi to get to Jebal Ali anyway They are building very close to the hotel but to be honest you are very rarely in your room anyway  if it is a problem they would move you if you asked  ask for a room away from the works  like we did when we checked in  
N => A three star in disguise We booked the Ascot hotel in Dubai after reading a description of the hotel on the internet  It was described as a deluxe four star hotel which had spacious and tastefull decorated rooms and also as it was a city hotel  provided complimentry access to a beautiful beach hotel the  Jebel Ali Hotel  We were expecting a good standard four star hotel because of the description but were met with a fusty smell upon stepping into the foyer  like stale cigarettes   We were shown to our room but as it was night we didn t notice the major construction works outside within    feet of our room  We certainly did notice at     am the next morning when we were woken by the noise of the workmen  When asked why the construction works had not been mentioned on the internet we were informed by the Hotel Manager that the hotel had not informed the Tour Operators  as if they had the information may have been kept on the internet and not removed   I found this excuse utterly amazing  We were moved to another room on our request which was quieter but not spacious like the description The room itself had loose plug sockets with exposed wires  The minibar was dirty and rusty  the room was dusty and the windows and ledges were dirty  The bed was hard and the bathroom had some mould on the ceiling  The TV also kept playing up  When we were taken to the beach in the complimentry taxi we asked to go to the Jebel Ali Hotel  as promised   We were informed there was no access to this hotel and were subsequently dropped off at the public beach The Ascot is more three star standard  My advice would be to book a five star hotel if you were looking for a four star as you would be guaranteed a good quality hotel  Many we looked at were absolutely fantastic  We felt a little jaded going back to  Fawlty Towers   
N =>  Waste of money Usually stay at the One and Only  Wish we had on this occasion We stayed with our children a teenager and  year old Very busy resort  poor service  terrible response to concerns i e          eing deducted from our credit card for security   despite what others may say this was non negoitiable  Even if we siad we wanted to pay everything in cash At one of the pools there was no pool   side service had to walk across resort to the other bar order and collect our own drinks Restaurants can use x  ezxcellent choice of asian cuisine  oriental and indian little for the youner palate unless you wish to pay in addition to your half board supplement Restaurants required a reservation   still a       minute minimum queue ensued  no order to organisation Staff were harassed notably because there were few of them  workforce depleted by     we were told   hotel was fully booked vacant rooms had been sold to  budget holiday companies Did not expect    standard in what cannot e a    resort  and I have stayed in a few  Never have I been so disappointed for my children  and myself that we wasted          on what was a sub standard holiday  
N =>  Overpriced and overrated   I am going to be completely honest here  and i know everybody s review is personal to themselves  but here goes     My family and i were really looking fwd to out   day trip to the Atlantis  as we are seasoned travellers to Dubai  The kids love the place  i love the weather and the glamourous nature of the luxury hotels etc When we were driving up to the hotel  i felt no rush of excitement  as i have previously  just disappointment  be because it is relatively new  it just felt not finished off  Before arrival  i emailed the hotel explaining that we had three small children  and if they had any availabily to keep a room for us on arrival at  am in the morning  i would be very grateful  When we walked into the reception area  it was packed   You couldn t move  My husband waited    minutes to get checked in  and suprise suprise  we didn t get a room  but funnily enough  my husbands parents did  and so did a few others  We just used their room to get changed in  until i realised that my suitcase was missing  and we had received two bags that weren t ours  It took  hrs to locate everything When we choose to go away  we do not wish to holiday at   star hotels  in dubai  with people dressed in football shirts and lager louts  Unfortunately  this is what this hotel is    a package holiday resort  The rooms are ok  but nothing special  the restaurants are tremendously expensive   went to nobu and this cost us      for the two of us    and drinks are ridiculously priced  The water park is the best thing  but not better than wild wadi If you are thinking of going  stay somewhere on the Jumeirah side  honestly  i m not joking  far better views  service etc  
N =>   would not consider it a five star We stayed for six nights and were expecting top class service from this new five star  What we got was a mix of good and bad  Our first night was good with the staff being very attentive but it went downhill from there  We received a fruit bowl which was never replenished although we got to look at our neighbours mouldy fruit that was left outside their room all day by the cleaning staff   we had to ask to get the minibar filled up  was completely empty   and did not have fresh water every day in the room as stated  The light in the shower went out and we had to wait    hours for it to be fixed and the toiletries were not always refilled  The rooms were very nice thoughand reasonably clean  We had to queue for breakfast most days which was a bit annoying The other irritating part about this hotel was the total lack of adherence to dress codes we did not enjoy watching other guests wandering around the hotel wearing swimwear or dressing gowns from the rooms  The water park was great but very busy in the afternoon  Overall a great holiday if you have children but not somewhere if you don t or are looking for a bit of luxoury  
N =>   Well be back next year  Have just returned from   nights at the Atlantis  Best holiday ever  After reading some of the comments on tripadvisor was open minded before we went  I was a bit worried as it was an expensive   day trip paid       for   nights Half Board  Destinology but I can honestly say it was money well spent  No queue at check in was given a room within   mins of arriving  in West wing in a deluxe room overlooking the swimming pool beach Lovely room  with   Queen size beds  plenty of room We had a choice of   restaurants to eat in on the Half Board option  Fantastic breakfast  amp  ate every night in Kaleidoscope Restaurant as we enjoyed it so much  We went to the Waterpark every day  which suited us as I got to sunbathe swim  amp  go on rides whilst my husband  amp     yr old daughter stayed on the reides lazy river all day  It was so convenient having the waterpark there you didnt even have to walk there  they took you on a golf buggy    The waterpark would have cost      a day   We drank in happy hour each night which was different times in the different bars We bought some drinks for our room from Duty Free on arriving at the airport which was a good idea  tip for next time is to take lemonade etc was spending       on cans of  up We charged everything to our room over the   days and our bill was      which wasnt too bad  Food is relatively cheap in waterpark approx       for french fries  Looking forward to the monorail being fully operational when we go back next year  All in all a fanastic holiday that we couldnt fault  
N =>   Awful service amd not worth staying there but great to come and visit for the day  We had an awful experience at the Atlantis  We had booked two rooms  one which was given to us on time and the other was given to us at     pm which basically meant that we missed half a day of having our room  The worst thing was  nobody informed us that our second room was even ready and when we went to complain the manager said it was ready at  pm  so I was like why didnt you call us leave a message  he had no answer   Our check out time was increased  which was nice of the hotel  We came back from a day out only to find somebody else  another guest  in our room  WITH OUR BELONGINGS IN THERE  I am just amazed how a    can allow this to occur  we were lucky that the guest had not taken anything rooted through our belongings  but this was just awful  The manager s response to this awful experience was   quot we are currently in a recession and have had to drop our rates quot  basically saying the service is not up to standard because of this recession  what rubbish   The waterpark is great  I think if your not a guest its around        dh  We ate at the buffet restaurant i think it was called kalaedascope   But it was great  really worth it and not that expensive  I would not recommend anyone to stay here  the rooms aren t even that great to be honest  but i would come for the day  well worth a visit  Also  be aware that the hotel is on the palm  not a great deal to do eat  but it only costs like    to get off the island but then extra to go from Jumeriah to wherever you want to go  
N =>   FANTASTIC TIME   AMAZING RESORT   We finished our first trip in Dubai with a couple of days at Atlantis  amp  WOW   We arrived at approx       and our room wasn t available   check in was quick  amp  the staff helpful  amp  we were told that they would try  amp  make the room available ASAP  Shorlty after       I went back to enquire on the progress  amp  the room allocated still wasn t available but they offered us an alternative room   I asked for one overlooking the pool  amp  that wasn t a problem  We had booked an Atlantis room which are on floors    amp  above  amp  we were allocated one on the eighth floor of the West Tower with an amazing view over the pool area  Luggage was brought promptly  amp  we were given an induction to the room by the bell boy  The hotel itself is fabulous  amp  the glass sculpture in the lobby stunning  The aquarium is at the East tower of the hotel  amp  also quite a feature but fairly busy  I noticed that the lobby  amp  aquarium areas were particularly busy during the day but a lot quieter in the evenings which I assumed was due to the fact there were alot of non residents during the daytime just in for a look around  The staff however are fairly strict on access  amp  ask for proof of residency to access a number of areas including the pool outside areas  The Lost Chambers is complimentary to residents  amp  passes    minutes  we done this while waiting for the room   The Water Park is good fun   compared to a normal pool   and passes the day fairly quickly  It is also manned with a significant number of lifeguards so is very safe even though none of the water is particularly deep anyway  Queue for the Leap of Faith   not surprisingly   was very long and in addition to this there are about   water coasters  like the one in Disney s Typhoon lagoon  but they re all very similar  amp  another flume ride that exits into the aquarium  There are also rapids  amp  a couple of routes round the lazy river   one with waves which is really fun  It s very handy that as a resident you can charge everything to your room so no need to carry any cash at all  The water park can be quite a trek back to the hotel but if you re lucky enough you may get picked up by the helpful staff in the little golf buggies   We had dinner in Saffron  Buffet restaurant  which was superb   variety was amazing  everything from Lobster  Oysters  amp  Sushi to British  Chinese or Indian fare  not to mention the selection of sweets  amp  the chocolate fountain   quite literally something for everyone   We also had breakfast in Saffron which again was super   great selection   only thing lacking was the service  I m still waiting on the pot of coffee   We also ate at sharkbites in the waterpark   very good burger  amp  fried chicken for about     each but    for a  quot tuna quot  baguette was ridiculous   it was half a baguette  amp  the tuna was spead thinner than a layer of butter   Another good feature is the hospitality lounge where you can check in after check out  amp  still use the hotel facilities as well as having shower facilities to freshen up  tea coffee water  amp  snacks and a lounge rest area to relax in if you have a late flight  A good selection of shops but none particularly busy except for the souvenir shop as the majority are fairly high end jewellery stores  We also liked the fact that altough the pool closed at a particular time  amp  lifeguards went off duty you could still use it in the late evening if you wanted  Overall fantastic  fun  beautiful hotel  amp  I would definintely return   yes it s expensive but that s to be expected  
N =>   Are you sure you can afford it  We booked this place quite simply because it was cheap  We got an unbeatable last minute deal on Amazon  which meant we got to stay in one of the best hotels in the world for     quid a night  However  I wish we hadn t Yes the accommodation was cheap  but we couldn t afford to eat or drink anything in the hotel  Even the mini bar was out of our price range  I m talking   quid for a packed of crisps  And because of its location you can t just wander to another hotel restaurant  
N =>   Over rated over priced and terrible service We stayed for one night for a special occassion  We chose Atlantis so we could use the water park and see what all the hype was about  What we liked The room was lovely and had a nice sea view I liked how the screens from the bathroom folded back so you could relax in the tub and watch the tv Aqua venture was fun and was very handy having it attached to the hotel The food in Locatelli s was lovely What we didn t like Everything is extremely overpriced  We live in Dubai and are used to expensive food and drinks but Atlantis takes prices to the extreme  There were a lot of hidden charges   when we checked out we were told we had to pay an extra     dhs for taxes etc  which are normally included in the room rate in other hotels in Dubai  We also had to pay   dhs to get our car from the valet despite having spent over     dhs on a one night stay The service at the bars around the pool was dreadful  It took ages to get served and then ages again to get the drinks  We actually walked out once we were so sick of waiting  At another pool bar we ordered some food and waited   mins for it to come only to find half of the order was missing  They did give us our drinks free with the meal though to make up for this  The downstairs part of the hotel was open to the public and very crowded with people who were not staying at the hotel taking pictures  All dressed up to go to the very expensive and supposedly exclusive restaurant Locatelli s and it felt like walking through a mall  There were obviously some good deals on in England at the moment as there were a lot of very loud British  charves  who spoiled our quiet time around the pool The aquarium The Lost Chambers was really just a collection of fish tanks  There was no information on the walls to say what the fish were or anything and there were some huge fish in tiny cages  They also still have Sammy the whale shark who they said they would release to the wild but are yet to do so so I don t think animal welfare is very important to them  There are a lot of better hotels to stay in at Dubai that are much classier and better value  I would recommend staying somewhere like the Le Meridien Mina Seyahi where our relatives stay when they come to visit and just paying to go to the aqua park at Atlantis for the day  
N =>   I don t see what people have to complain about We  me  wife and kids         amp     stayed for   days at the Atlantis prior to moving to our usual hotel  the Jumeirah Beach  comparison to come on the Forum   Following some of the reviews we were a little sceptical but thought we d give it a go I really cannot see how anyone can complain about this hotel with the possible exception of the cost The staff were all very polite and efficient The rooms are fantastic  We asked for and got connecting rooms The pool areas and beach are great  lots of sunbeds without having to get up at the crack of dawn to secure a good one Although we didn t get to try all the restaurants the ones we did were all superb  I have to mention the buffet restaurant Saffron  Calling it a budget restaurant really doesn t do it justice  The choices were varied and all of great quality  The seafood counter was unbelievable   oysters  prawns  lobster  crab  mussels and so on  all as part of the price  about      Free entry to Aquaventure   much better than the Wild Wadi which in itself is fabulous anyway I wouldn t pay to get into the aquarium but seeing as you don t have to when you are a guest we gave it a look and it was excellent The only possible complaint about the hotel must be the cost which was very expensive  Other than that no problems at all and we will be going back  
N =>  Fantastic Holiday  with a few ups and downs  I stayed at the Atlantis with my friend as part of my   st birthday celebrations at the end of y for   nights  The room was booked as a deluxe room through Virgin Holidays Before leaving I read some pretty mixed reviews about this hotel on this site  so departed to the airport feeling a little anxious about what to expect  Previously on trips to Dubai I have stayed in the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  but wanted to try something different this time so thought the Atlantis was a close match in terms of amenities Flights were with Virgin Atlantic both ways  excellent service in Premium Economy however the In Flight Entertainment was not as good on the return leg as it was not  On Demand   Still  I would recommend Virgin Atlantic for this route any day We pre booked an Atlantis car to pick us up from the Airport  as it was my friend s first time in Dubai  which cost in the region of      It was a BMW   series with Atlantis branding on it and whilst it was supposed to be a nice start to the journey  I was not enamoured as the interior was shoddy and the driver didn t even exchange pleasantries  which compared to the Jumierah Beach Hotel Audi service  it left a lot to be desired We arrived at the hotel very early and expected to have to wait until the advertised check in time however we were delighted to be given a room straight away  this is something that impressed us after such a long trip from Glasgow Heathrow Dubai  The lobby is magnificent with an amazing glass sculpture in the middle  which is a little ostentatious  but an amazing sight none the less After a small dispute regarding a guarantee deposit  in that I plainly refused to pay such a large volume of cash for incidentals  we headed up to our room and despite the early check in advantage  the room was on a low floor with a limited view Whilst waiting for our bags to arrive  which took some time we discovered that there was a few things wrong with the room such as a cigarette burn in the carpet  we requested non smoking  and the bath was stained  but we shrugged it off as we were so tired The hotel itself is amazing  the water park honestly puts the Wild Wadi in the shade  we spent a lot of our time there and had a blast  The Lost Chambers were also amazing and we spent a good few hours wandering around with our Cold Stone Creamery Ice creams in there taking numerous pictures After a few complaints regarding monetary disputes and the condition of the first room we got moved to another room which had much better views and a full sized balcony  which was a nice touch  and our complaint was dealt with very well  Thank you to all involved Overall  the hotel is new  it needs a few more months to get things perfect  For instance  the staff are incredibly nice and helpful  yet some of the managerial staff at the front desk are nothing short of rude  Our turndown service was only completed     nights and like other reviewers have noted  unlike the JBH or similar there are no chocolates on the pillow when it is done  Our second room also had continuous problems with the air conditioning but I will give the repairmen their due  they were there trying to fix it every day when we were out  We didn t want to pack and move again so just dealt with the room being slightly hotter than we would have liked Breakfast was included in our tariff so we were shocked to have to sign for     Dhs every day  but this never showed on our account  I would recommend eating in Saffron instead of Kaleidoscope for breakfast  and get there before       or you have to wait in a rather large queue  Evening meals  well  we only ate in the hotel twice as I had to take my friend to other places around Dubai I couldn t miss  we ate in Kaleidoscope for dinner and it was terrible and also Locatelli s which was very nice  so a rather mixed feeling there The beach isn t nearly as bad as it is made out to be  yes there are a few jelly fish but they weren t within the swimming area cordoned off by the hotel and as far as I can tell  they posed very little risk  besides there are a plethora of lifeguards available To finally sum it up  we had a fantastic stay at the Atlantis  it is a   star hotel with a few creases that need ironed out  but with the selection of amenities and friendly staff at hand  I would definitely return again  maybe   Atlantis    Jumeirah Beach   Yes it is pricey  but so are most   star hotels  however the internet prices do take the biscuit   come on Kerzner  it is free at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel Oh  and don t dare miss the Thursday night extravaganza at Aquaventure  going round the Ziggurat with fireworks going off is something that will never leave my memories   truly fantastic  
N =>  Disney in Dubai Went to Atlantis with the family for a couple of days to celebrate our son s   st birthday  amp  it was a big success  I have to admit that we have avoided this hotel since it opened as huge  resort hotels are not really our thing but for a short break we chose Atlantis for it s waterpark  restaurants  night club  amp  choice of activities  amp  none of these disappointed  Yes  there were little problems  check in took forever as did check out   the Palm island view room that we had reserved had been replaced with an Ocean View  the Palm View is the best side to view the fireworks on Thursday nights during the summer   amp  items were added to our bill that were not ours but the staff are lovely so you just need to be patient  For our son s birthday dinner  the waiter came up to our table  amp  shouted  he had to shout to be heard as it was extremely busy  amp  noisy   What name do you want us to put on your son s birthday cake  quot    so much for the birthday surprise that we had arranged  But again  the staff are all so sweet that it is impossible to be cross  They charge you for everything from valet parking to in room internet access  these things are free in many other Dubai hotels  and it is the little details that makes the difference between a good hotel  amp  a top class one  So   days were definitely enough  The hotel is extremely busy  noisy  amp  feels very much like a conveyor belt Disney Resort  which was fine as that was what we exxpected but we wouldn t have wanted to stay longer  It is possible to do Dubai in a large scale hotel without feeling like a mass commodity   Dar Al Masyaf is in the huge Madinat Jumeirah complex but it is in a different league to Atlantis  My advice would be to choose wisely   for a family or young couple or for those wanting entertainment  amp  action then Atlantis is probably perfect but if you want more in the way of style  service  amp  exclusivity  then try any of the Jumeirah hotels or Al Maha   they are in a different league  
N =>  Take plenty money We arrived at the Atlantis at   in the morning all looked nice but huge we checked in and ent to our room half a mile away it seemed to arrive at a double room which didnt have a bed for our son so back to reception it was and we moved to our second room only to find e were on a smoking floor and smoking room back to reception again nearly   hour after arriving we were put in the wes wing on the   th floor to an alright room quite basic really for a   star but were shattered so went to bed not a good start  The hotel itself is ok but beware if your not fit dont go its so huge you do a lot of walking  We went to the waterpark the first morning which is free to hotel guests and it was ok but nothing special only a few slides they say it is the biggest in middle east and probably is but we usually go to Florida and was not in the same league as Florida at all  although the staff were very freindly prices all over the Atlantis were ridiculous a cup of tea after dinner cost us over    we were on half board option so we only had to pay for our drinks just as well or we wouldnt be eating there at all we worked it out at for three of us for breakfast      there was plenty of choice but after a couple of days we were fed up of the food catered mainly for the locals and the same at dinner when you did get in afete a long que the food was mainly spicy all though very nicely presented if i never see another curry again it will be too soon  Avoid the spa unlessyouve taken out a bank loan  the hairdressers are from Syria and dont speak any English at all so they do what they want then charge you a fortune my blow dry was     and even then he didnt have any straighteners  We felt the hotel was too big and lacked the personel touch it was no way a five star more like a   or   star not worth the money at all after   days we were bored with it all so decided to have some trips out so we took a hotel taxi which were quite cheap but the did try to rip us off by taking us the very long route till i pointed it out to him they are also very smelly as you would be stuck in a taxi for    hours deoderant was needed by all the drivers we had  however we went to the Burg Al Arab for lunch which was nice about     each but beware as ou dont get to sit with the hotel guests we were put in a seperate area for visitors lunch was nice but nothing special again and we did get to take some photos of the inside of the hotel but ony certain parts and away from the guests so ony at certain times of the day   All in all Dubai is a complete rip off dont go if your expecting bargains as it is much more expensive than UK even for clothes it is very dusty everywhere due to all the building works going on weve been but rest assured we will not be back we will go back to Florida next year and let others be ripped of at the not so great Atlantis and Dubai BE WARNED lly 
N =>  Brillant stay The checking in process was long and a bit annoying  We arrived early in the morning about  am and were told we had to wait for the room until pm  They had a nice waiting area with drinks and snacks  Once we got our room it was not what we requested so had to change it  Then we got our room and just started to rest our eyes and they asked us to move as they needed the room for a disabled person  But was upgraded and had free wine and chocolates  The room was huge and really comfortable I was surprised there was no welcoming talk to tell you about the hotel or activities  This may depend on the tour operator The hotel itself is massive and impressive  But can be busy at times  The staff are very helpful and always willing to do anything  The pool areas were great and had plenty of sun beds  although the old dirty towels are not always removed  The beach is beautiful  I spent most of my time swimming here  such clear sea and so quiet  The most people on there was probably about    guests  The sea does have jelly fish but I went most days and only saw one  which was bright blue so can t miss them  The life guards are very good at spotting them  The waterpark is good fun and we went on an evening  not to be missed  Dolphin bay  is great but again very expensive  Do the dessert trip  its so much fun Taxis are cheap to get around but we did not realise towards the end of the stay that there are free stuttle buses to different places  ahhhhThe food is wonderful big portions  so much choice but expensive  The only down side I had was at the poolside cafe  the shore one of the staff was always very grumpy  But no other staff presented in this manner  I wouldn t go for   nights because there is not much to do unless you love shopping or just want to go on the beach pool The weather was so hot but didn t get a tan because there was no sun lots of cloud  
N =>   Really nice i have travelled to Dubai many times over the last few years  We have stayed at Jumeirah Beach  Mina Salaam and Al Qasr in the past This year we decided to try Atlantis  was really apprehensive after reading reviews on trip advisor BrieflyRooms   we had sea facing room in the West Tower   clean and pleasant  our house keeper was really helpful gave us everthing we asked for and the room was always made up when we askedFood   went half board   good food at Saffron  less so at Kaleidoscope  serice very good had to pay for drinks   GULPStaff  really helpful and pleasant   no problems here at all   no on was rude to us Aquarium   lots of fishAquaventure waterpark    most fun better than Wild Wadi OverallIf you dont mind being in busy hotel then Atlantis IMO is a good place for a break   i think it offers a different experience to the Jumeirah group   kids want to go back next year    thats good enough for me 
N =>   Not worth it by a long shot Having travelled to many luxury hotels all over the world   this place fell short by a mile  Hyped as being   star   no way  Not worth anything like the prices they charge  I stayed in an Executive Room which I then had to spend a small fortune on being upgraded to a suite as the  quot Executive Room quot  was no more luxurious than  quot flee in the air quot   Saying that   even the suite wasn t that sylish  The colours and furnishings were pretty standard  No flair  It is well worth travelling out of the hotel to eat as the prices in the place are beyond belief  At lunch  we had   salads  adults   I chicken nugget  kids meal    x glasses of white wine    x diet coke    x water and a fruit juice                I will not be going back   there are so many luxury hotels to choose from in Dubai   I wished I had tried one instead of falling for the hype of this one  Rip off 
N =>   Everything you want to know about the Atlantis I read review after review about the Atlantis prior to travelling and there was elements of all reviews during my trip  along with my wife and children  two boys aged    amp      We stayed    nights from   th y to   th y      On the negative    we were continually being charged    Dirham to our room for breakfast   although we were booked for bed and breakfast  and had to continually ask them to remove it  they advised it was due to my teenage son being an adult  which we had already booked him as   Couple of times we had to ask twice for a drink we ordered  once at the poolside bar and they tried to charge us twice albeit only   drink arrived and the second time at breakfast my wife asked for a cafe latte and to ask again Received fresh fruit once in our room  our first day when we answered the door to the lady delivering it  not sure if she was calling thereafter when we were out or if the fruit was a one off on arrival The food and drink is expensive  no getting away from this DO NOT touch the mini bar  remove an item  amp  too late  you re charged  On the positive   The quality of the food in the reastaurants in the evening was exquisite  you get what you pay for  amp  all of us thoroughly enjoyed the food  The staff throughout the hotel were excellent  all very polite and helpful  read some reviews about their ability to speak english  but didn t experience any problems  hey I can t speak any language other than my native tongue      Hotel was spotless  rooms very clean  Room cleaning was thorough  clean sheets  towels and fresh water daily  we aksed for an additional bottle of water a few times and it wasn t a problem  staff were more than happy to supply  Breakfast was amazing  you name it it s there             As we weren t receiving fresh fruit in our room daily we d take a few pieces from breakfast  The water park is a huge bonus when you have kids  we were there virtually every day   great fun when you can waltz in and out as a guest when it s included in your costs for the hotel  There are happy hours at various bars which soften the blow  a bit  for the expensive drinks  you could go between bars from  pm to   pm and experience the happy hours between them  but it isn t this type of holiday to be honest  The experience of staying at the atlantis was great  fantastic fireworks on the Thursday evening which we had a great view of from our room  prior to the fireworks we had been at the water park for the night adventure  it was good fun but far too busy  huge queues on all slides after approx              We tried room service one evening we didn t want to go out  amp     out of     food hot  fresh and served with a smile My son tried the teenage kids club towards the end of the holiday and wished he d went earlier  he met many new friends and thought the staff great Heard others comparing antlantis to other hotels i e free ice lollies and cool spray down at Jumeria beach  as well as chocolate on pillows during turn down  and fresh fruit every day  not huge value monetary wise but would be nice if antlantis provided this too All in all this was an excellent holiday and I d recommend the atlantis  a few minor problems but was more than happy with the overall experience  
Not Impressed Very Poor Customer Service Most Likely will not return we booked a three night stay at the Atlantis the palm from y   st to y   th  we have been here   nights now and would just say the Hype is much more than reality Yes The Hotel is nice and has good amenities  but it is not the exclusive ultimate experience it is made out to be The directions to the Hotel were very poor  we called the hotel   times on the way and went around in circles  till we finally asked for help and found our way The check in was good and efficient  the room very nice and the view was quite good  The staff was well trained and most times polite and efficient The experience that turned me off the most was the way they dealt with one of the promotions  When I made the booking  they had a promotion that you would get a complimentary massage for every massage you booked  This promotion was posted on their website even as late as yesterday afternoon     y        But the Spa refused to acknowledge that and said it was an old promotion valid only till e and now they would not be able to offer it  when I mentioned the fact that it was posted online even as we spoke  They gave me the run around and three different employees called me without so much as accepting my point but promising to call me back  the call never came  This is typical cheap     star hotel behaviour  For a Hotel that claims to be luxury hotel and   star standard etc would never deal with the issue in such manner and all that for equivalent of US     The water park is good but there are many water parks the world over that we have enjoyed more  The prices were exorbitant and once you were in everything was charged for I would rate my experience as not exciting  be if the hype had not been so much and my expectations were lower it might not have been that bad But at this point of time  unless I receive an apology from the hotel for their poor customer service will not return  
N =>   Great hotel but too big for personalized service We stayed in Atlantis in y       Had heard and read a lot about it and were eagerly looking forward to our stay  Just the opening night festivities were supposed to have costed US    million out of which     million was repuated to be spent just on the fireworks alone  which were supposed to be   times bigger than the China olympic games display   I will be particularly detailed in my comments since I know that tripadvisor reviews are circulated amongst the hotel management team From a holiday destination perspective  we decided to stay at the Atlantis since they were running a great promotion  The rack rate for a normal Atlantis room was a few thousand Dhirams  We booked through booking com and ended paying approx       Dhirams per night  not including      in taxes   Anyhow  we arrived  Our first impression was that the lobby was a fish market  The reception disks  if I remember correctly  did not have signs indicating what they were for  the lines were long and there were too many people hanging around  We had no clue which line to go to  Anyhow  we finally crossed our fingers and got into a line  Whilst checking in  we specified a non smoking room  A trainee host took us up to our room  Guess what  The room reeked of smoke  On saying that i wanted my room changed  I was told that they could not change the room since it was a weekend  When I insisted and said that it was impossible for me to sleep in the room  we were reluctantly led back down all the way to the front desk  we again stood in line and finally got the room got switched  Thus the initial experience was quite jarring Going forward  the hotel itself is huge  approx        rooms   beautiful and one of the nicest properties I have ever stayed in  The Atlantis type of room that we stayed in was immaculately well done  We could not wait to get settled in and move on to explore the rest of the hotel  The first thing that we check out was the restaurants  We had read a lot about the great dining options and were keen to decide on where we were going to eat dinner  The hotel has     restautants and they are spread throughout the hotel  What I would have ideally wanted is a book with all the menus in one place  Its a bummer that this was something that nobody had thought of and we had to trudge from one place to the next trying to remember what everybody served so that we could make a decision  This was specially important as I am a vegetarian with limited menu options  Anyhow  the food made up for everything  If you re a foodie  then you ve died and entered into foodie heaven  The only problem with dining is the lack of many informal   quick dining options  They seems to be limited to a couple of dining places next to the main pool Next step was an outdoor exploration of the hotel  I would really recommend that the hotel invests in coin operated laundry machines for the guests  I had not expected to see clothes being hung out to dry from the balconies but this was not uncommon  Having said that  the hotel is huge and inspiring  It esp  look really cool at night The massive fish tank is astounding  The tank walls are made of acrylic and were shipped over from Japan  They are supposed to be   cm to   cm thick  There are thousand of fish in the tank  Mind blowing  Don t forget to take a  quot back of the house tour quot  if time permits  You get to check out how this all works We spent a good amount of time at the Aquaventure park  This is something not to be missed and hotel guests get in for free  The best part of the park were the rides which start from the Ziggurat  I literally had my heart in my mouth when I was standing in the line for the  quot Leap of Faith quot  ride slide  The view of the palm from the top of the Ziggurat is fabulous  Don t miss it  Also don t forget to check out the Cold Stone creamery near the entrance to Aquaventure  A visit there is a good way to end a tiring water filled day The hotel has a nightclub which was pretty happening when we went  A good place for the guys to hang out    The hotel has a massive convention centre  which seemed to be mostly unused   If I had a business meeting  I would certainly consider having it here  From a security perspective  it seemed kind of weak  We only had to say our room  and name to get access to most everything  Ideally  they would ask us to at least show room keys The guests seemed to be pretty homogeneous  Approx      of hotel residents in a typical year are from the UK and another approx      would be from Russia  So if you are those countries  you ll have plenty of company If I was the hotel management  I would invest in english language training for the staff  There were times when we could not make ourselves understood at the first go  Apparently  most of the staff was hired as fresh graduates without any prior hotel experience and it shows  Service level almost everywhere can improve  For example  used plates and cutlery in our room was not replaced when the room was done in the mornings  For a hotel which aspires to have a minimum rack rate   non discounted charge for the cheapest room to be close to US      the service is not good enough  It I had paid anything close to rack rate  I would have felt very unhappy  The product is world class and no cost has been spared on it but lacks the finish on account of service levels not being up to the mark  If I was the hotel owner  I would locate a guy called Pierre  who used to be the general manager of the Imperial Hotel in New Delhi till some time back and put him to work at the Atlantis  Did I get my money s worth  Definitely yes  Would I ever pay full price  Definitely not  
N =>   Not all that it s cracked up to be       As we are regular holiday makers to Dubai  we felt a change from the usual Jumeriah Beach hotel was in order  however  I was glad that we still had   nights at an old favourite and   nights at the Atlantis as I would not have liked to spend the whole holiday there  I was reminded of a Las Vegas style and proportion hotel on first impressions  I was immediately disappointed in the service  we specifically requested a non smoking room only to be put in one with a liberal supply of ashtrays  We were not offered any option on check in and working in healthcare  specifically in chest medicine  I would not spend my holiday in an ex smoking environment  However this was rectified after a trip back to reception desk to a non smoking floor with an excellent view over the Palm  Unlike other visitors  we were not given a rundown of the hotel or explanation of where we could eat  this was up to us to find out  The outdoor areas were excellent  although I do agree with other reviewers that the pool was quite basic and some interesting features would have been nice  The Aquaventure was good fun and much better than Wild Wadi  howver  had we not been guests of the hotel  I would have been loathe to pay the rather steep admission prices  I also felt that the prices for Dolphin Bay and to feed the fish in the Ambassador Lagoon was excessive for hotel guests Other downsides were that the turndown service did not occur every night and small details evident at Jumeriah were missing such as vanity kits  I had to request gowns and slippers  room service was slow and service in restaurants was not always up to the mark apart from a select few waiters However  when any issues were taken to management  the individuals concerned tried their best to rectify problems but I feel that we should not have had to bring anything to their attention at all    Having seen it and done it  I had a reasonable time but would not rush back but I would not discourage others from trying it out as obviously others experiences have varied according to reviews  
N =>   Amazing We stayed   days just for the experience and it was totally amazing  The hotel  staff  facilities and service were all first class  The hotel was full but there was never any shortage of sun beds around the pool or on the beach and staff are always on hand to lay out your towel  get drinks  give you directions  transport you to different areas in the hotel grounds  in fact everything you would expect of a luxury hotel We paid an extra     per head to go half board and it was well worth it  The restaurants in general were expensive but the food in the two buffet restaurants we could use was fantastic  We have stayed in some very good hotels over the years but never seen such a variety of food on offer and it was all freshly cooked and continually topped up  We never had to queue to get in or to be served which was surprising considering how many guests there were The aquarium which has        fish including a whale shark  is mesmerizing  The Aquaventure Park adjacent to the hotel is great fun even for more mature tourists like ourselves and was a good way to keep cool in the heat It was our fourth trip to Dubai but the first to Atlantis and we would certainly go back  
N =>   Good but nothing superbly great    The Atlantis is one of those hotels that is more about the hype  We went here for our honeymoon and found it quite ok  Needless to say it was extremely overpriced but the accomodation came with entry to the waterpark  which was quite nice   The lobby was extremely crowded at any time and did not seem air conditioned  However  we had a pleasant stay and the staff were great  We even got a complimentary cake wishing us a happy honeymoon  
N =>  Superb fo families Just returned from a short break at Atlantis  having previously stayed   nights at the Mina a salam  and   nights at the burj al arab   years ago  Asked for room upgrade cheekily  and was personally escorted to a    th floor large room  with views of the palm Room was typically up to standard large bathroom with good quality shampoos  gels etc  Every member of staff said hello when passing  even had the lift button pressed for us  The overall standard and finish of atlantis was very high giving the right impression youve spent your money well  The restaurants were very expensive  and we dined wherever we ended our day which was much cheaper The aqua park was superb and spent several hours each day being silly  The lost chambers was also very good As guests get free access to both it makes for a great value destination  Breakfast was also superbly varied kept us going all day but can be a que to get in If its an upmarket hotel with ambience to suit then may be stay elsewhere  but for families i dont think theres much to beat it with only a   hour flight  Limo from airport      taxi to airport      Driving time barely half an hour When dubai is finished goodbye florida  Ps you must try the skiing   
N =>  beautiful place after reading previous reviews about prices i was a bit worried but even though prices were high they were not as bad as i was expecting  Breakfast was wonderful there was   restaurants to have breakfast both on either side of the hotel i found the saffron one the best  the hotel was lovely and the staff very helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble for them  the bed in my room was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in and everything in dubai was immaculate and clean the heat was unbearable and i was not able to sunbath on my lounger to sunbath i had to sit in the pool constantly  the hoods on the loungers were a god send and you also had to put towels on top of the hoods to block out the sun  the water park was slightly cheaper than the hotel for drinks a coke in there was    dirhams and    in the hotel  a kids meal in the water park was    dirhams the water park was nice but due to the heat it was too much effort to walk around and go on the slides the lost chambers was a load of rubbish and i would not have been happy if i had to pay to go in there luckily as residents it was free  we took a taxi every night into the mall or marina as it was cheaper to eat out down there  the marina was very nice but also quiet found a lovely indian restaurant which was very reasonable in price  the mall of the emirates was massive and had a ski slope in there which is well worth a visit  the dubai mall had an ice rink in but was a lot further away than the emirates mall  taxis were quite reasonable from the hotel to the mall we worked it out depending on traffic as they run on meters they were costing anything from       dirhams which is around     pound do not book any trips from the hotel were going to book a dessert safari from there brochure on the concirege but after a trip to the mall we found a tour operator there that did the same safari for half the price  the safari was good however i did not enjoy the sand dunning it was too hot and made me feel sick but the campsite and the food was very nice well worth doing and we went with fun tours situated in the mall of the emirates water is left for you everyday but they only left   but if you want more just ask the room boys and they will give you more  dubai was nothing like i expected it to be it was a cross between new york with american malls  i enjoyed the holiday and the hotel was lovely but i would not be in a hurry to go back to dubai unless the price was cheap on check out they also tried charging me for a bottle of whisky they said was taken from the mini bar but no one had taken it as i dont drink and my partner cant stand whisky so the only thing we could think of was the room boys  they did take the charge off but be careful towels are provided at the hotel and water park  also they do come around the pool handing out lollies free of charge every day  
N =>  Good experience   outstanding restaurants Very large hotel complex with good entertainment facilities  Good for two days but certainly not for longer stay  No large twin beds in the suite but just a rather small mini queensize bed  Why don t you offer two queen beds  One mattress is good for part time enjoyment  Not all your clients like to sleep on the same mattress full time Suite in the East tower was very noisy because of the air conditioning system close by  We realised it only after we were already settled there and did not want to lose time when moving to another suite Food was really outstanding in Ossiano and Nobu  The Asian breakfast choices at Saffron were excellent  Food at Nasimi was deficient   just  beach food  Pools are good for kids  Not good for swimming  
N =>   Over rated  stayed for    nights for our honeymoon plus took our   yr old daughter  was met at reception with frosty staff who had no record of our booking eventually gave us a room then demanded a credit card and      dirham as deposit   we were not informed anything about this before   when informed did not have it with us they cheekly remarked we would have our phone locked and mini bar  and made out we would not be treated well in restuarants  this was infront of other people which was highly embarassing  had to call back and for to travel agents who were disgusted with the way that we were being treated  then were saying we were B amp B even though we paid for Half Board  again more phone calls till it was sorted  no apology or anything from Atlantis even though they told Gold Medal they were sending champagne as it was our honeymoon but nothing the hotel itself is amazing to see but could be done as day trip nothing else  very disppointed in the staff and nobody really wants to tell you how things work or what to do its really find out for yourself over priced in the hotel and the only restuarant which we found to be child friendly was Kaleidoscope  nothing for   yr olds aquaventure great  wuould go back to dubai but definately a different hotel  
N =>   Don t park eat or drink Went to Dubai for a   day break  Hotel was fine  rooms large  amp  comfortable and service good as you d expect  Two things let it down  First the parking   unless you take the     valet option the parking arrangements are garbage   staff are unwilling unable to explain the complimentary parking is miles away and the courtesy bus drops you near tower entrances   so expect a    minute walk back to the hotel properm budget on    mins to park and get back to your room Don t ask for a cocktail  the barkeeper seems to have no knowledge or training and produced lousy drinks so stick to Johnny Black  Restaurtants were OK but not what s expected from a   star hotel  Particularly disappointing was the mediocre food at Ronda Locatelli  The food served wasn t even the food on the menu Lasaga al ragu   with bechamel  not ragu  insalata mista   heavily overdressed but underseasoned  We also ate Gordon Ramsey restaurant in the creek Hilton   MUCH better food Would we go back   possibly  but next trip we re booked into Jumera beach  
Not sure if it was what I had been looking for I was looking for something more romantic and elegant but what I ve found is the big differences among the pictures on the Atlantis website and the reality  Also didn t like the quality of the sand of the beach which is artificial  In terms of the price I would recommend somewhere else  
Nice if you look from outside I stayed in the hotel about    days and i can say it was not what I expected  The location  view  Aquaventure  aquarium and food were good  but on the other hand there were many difficulties and mismanagements in the hotel First  the hotel charges you for almost everything for example the parking facility is only available through valet and the hotel charge you    Dhs for a parking pass and every time you give your car to a valet or ask them to bring your car they ask you whether you have paid the    Dhs for the parking pass or not and that is annoying  they couls only ask for the pass not whether you have paid for it or not  They also charge you     Dhs for valet if you were not a guest and i guess that was the reason they ask for your parking pass alot   Also when it is a crowded it almost takes    minutes to get to a valet or for them to bring your car Second  the mini bar is electronic and if you even take one thing just to look at it they charge it to your bill and imagine being in a hotel with a     year old kid who goes and plays with the fridge once in a while and I had to call the room service and explain to them about the whole incident ant telling them to either empty the mini bar or lock it and after asking for   or   times they finally agreed to lock it Third  the bathroom does not have a place for hanging wet clothes and you would see people hanging their wet swim wear and clothing from the balcony fence and for a luxury hotel that is not a pretty sight Forth the television channels were very limited and mostly were free channels and very few entertainment channels  but the hotel has a pay per view channel instead Fifth  one other thing in the charging everything to your bill part was the internet  in most hotels I have been to before using wireless and business center internet were free for the guests and only high speed wired internet in the room had a charge here you had to pay    Dhs for   hour or    Dhs for a day or     Dhs for your whole stay for wireless internet and    Dhs for    minutes use of internet in the business center and    Dhs for an A  print   FYI  US      DHS Sixth  the room service was not very good took em   days to refill the hand washing liquid and only   times they replaced a sanitary bag in the toilet For conclusion i recommend this hotel only if you want to use the Aquaveture every day since it is free for hotel guests and it makes the hotel costs reasonable  otherwise i recommend other hotels like for example Royal Meridien  
Not as great as made out to be The hotel demanded a visit due to all the hype and granduer surrounding the launch so wehn we discovered reasonable tariff to stay we opted in  Of course  many others also opted in which unfortunately ment that the    hotel was not represented by the best crowd it deserved Rooms are basic but comfortable  room service menu leaves a lot to be desired  The bathroom was excellent  The star attractions are no doubt the aquamarine life on display  adventure park and the dolphin experience  They are absolutely fantastic and very much recommended for families with kids of all ages  All have surcharges  nothing is included The pools are fine  they have more than one   What is good that they have a baby pool for little kids The main issue is the construction surrounding the hotel  One view from the hotel room is of the sea  plain and simple  and the other side is their beach  which is not swim worthy  and city view of construction and a few buildings in the distance  
N =>   Not for us   Not a Luxury Hotel for Couples  Well we moved onto this Hotel after spending our first two nights in Dubai at the wonderful Burj Al Arab So  let s start with the best bits  The Atlantis is gorgeous  the grounds  the pool and the food though quite expensive is really lovely  The staff at this hotel is its saving grace  They are just so friendly and so helpful  they could not do enough for you Now the reason we would probably not return This is our third time to Dubai and we do love our Luxury  This is something the Atlantis promotes but sadly for us  it did not deliver The hotel really for us was far too big and though not too crowded it just seemed like a huge Florida hotel that was promising luxury but at times looked like a massive theme park hotel We would have loved to have seen areas for Adults only Our room had paper thin walls and the first night I was kept awake until      am with children screaming in the next room  I thought this would never finish  luckily they must have checked out the next day  surely though you shouldn t be able to hear every word and sound in the next room in a  Luxury  Hotel  The Imperial Club for us was a complete waste of money  We have always stayed Premier Leisure Club in the Al Qasr at the Madinat Jumeriah and it has been brilliant   however you could not compare the Al Qasr lounges to the Atlantis We only used it twice the whole of our stay  it was fine if you are a drinker  which we are  but as to the food  it ran out every time we went into the lounge In fact I think the only food we had  would have filled a small tea plate the whole stay One chap waited for at least    mins for the food to be replenished and it never came  We thought that was disgraceful   what were we paying for   Again though the staff in the Imperial Club were amazing I am sorry to complain about this hotel because the staff and the surroundings are really great  but it s just too big to claim to be a luxury hotel and to have hoards of day visitors  it doesn t do the hotel any favours Another tip  be careful in Aquaventure  I hurt my back quite badly due to deflated tubes I also heard that there have been numerous other incidents too We probably won t return to the Atlantis  which is a shame  
N =>   Fantastic  What a Resort    We had an absolutely fantastic time here It was only a short stay    nights  to get away from cold sunless London and what a good choice it was  Sun is guaranteed but the Atlantis surpassed all expectations  The rooms were immaculate and comfortable but the real treat were the staff  They would go out of their way to help you enjoy your stay We laid by the pool  taking a little hut to hide a little from the midday sun  and we were constantly offered iced lollies to cool us  note to self must say no sometimes     but the inner child in us made us try the water park one day which was great fun too There are plenty of restaurants on offer  Nobu and Levantine both standouts For an extended weekend stay to warm up from a decidedly chilly spring in London Atlantis was just what we needed   
N =>   Superb Hotel Location is Amazing Best breakfast spread I have EVER seen  ided to stay   night there  as stay includes the water park and lost chambers  We got our room early  great  and began our Water park adventure  great rides all around  finally did not do the leap of faith  next time I will    The hotel is expensive  but then  hey look at it  Huge  rooms     sqmtrs  huge bathrooms  all have balconies overlloking the palms or open ocean  Back to the waterpark  The rides were fun  my kids tried almost all  I was disappointed they did not have great white sharks   But we saw a whale shark and my kids were thrilled  I still say they could get a great white  The DOlphin Bay  we only sat behind  would have loved to do it  Expensive when   are involved  DH     per person for hotel guests  Ouch   I know its a once in a lifetime thing  again  maybe next time  The breakfast  included  was Man    the largest spread I have EVER seen  And superb to say the least  HUGE restaurant  Safforn  We ate at one other restaurant  pricey  but then  hotel is a deluxw luxury place  so anticipate that  one thing upset me  in the water park  damn it  they could afford to put water fountains near the toilets at least  COme on  You go to buy a water bottle     ml and it costs a bomb  Dubai heat  you need lots of water  water fountains need to be provided  its not downgrading if thats what they thinks  Rest  if the price works for you  you HAVE to stay there for a night at least  
New Hotel   So So From the view of a    year old We stayed here for   nights after a week in the Park Hyatt  recommend completely  refer to my article on that hotel  to have some fun at the water park  By the way  I am   of   kids in a family of    We had booked two rooms in the imperial club  We arrived just after noon at the hotel and checked into our room only to be told that we would have to wait for    minutes before they were ready  We said that that was okay and they escorted us to the imperial lounge on the   th floor  The lounge was amazing  it overlooked the ambassador lagoon  one of the largest aquarium tanks in the world  with the whale shark swimming around on the surface  look at my photos   The lounge has a small buffet that changes at different times of the day  breakfast  lunch  afternoon tea and dinner  It is complimentary  So after    minutes we went up to the desk of the lounge to ask about our rooms and they told us that it would be a little bit longer  So we waited another    minutes just to be told it would be more than an hour before the rooms were ready      So I took my brother and sister down to the lost chambers  It is like a small ancient aquarium with lobsters  tropical fish  jellyfish  eels  and more including a viewing panel into the ambassador lagoon  We spent about    minutes in the lost chambers then went back up to the lounge and waited another  h   min     We were then finally escorted to our rooms on the   th floor  We had booked one suite and one standard twin  My brother  my sister and I slept in the standard twin with a rollaway and my parents and my little sister slept in the suite with a rollaway  Staying in the imperial club also gives you complimentary wireless internet access in your room and in the lounge  The waterpark is amazing  It had one central waterslide tower with two ways to get up  You either walk or take the conveyor belt on your tube  The leap of faith at the top is an almost vertical drop from    meters through a shark tank  The tube ride that goes through the shark tank is not great  The ride is awesome but when you get into the tank the glass is scratched and you cannot see much  It is much better to watching the people go through from the viewing panel  The children s play area is great and the rapids are OK  Though the torrent was awesome  they throw you in front of the wave maker and it sometimes flips you over  At the time we were there the hotel was extremely busy but the waterpark was quite quiet  The rooms were very nice but the wait at the start really put us off  The Kaleidoscope restaurant I recommend  They do a buffet with worldwide cuisines  The hotel also has a variety of shops on the way to Aquaventure and the pool is absolutely amazing  The hotel was nice but the wait was really annoying  Jet Privelage Number        
N =>   Nice Hotel but not worth the money Just returned from  nts at Atlantis  hotel itself is nice  Room was fine and the resort was good  kids enjoyed pool  amp  beach areas but thats as good as it gets  Service was poor  we have been to Dubai many times and maybe expect to much but was left disappointed Food is stupidly expensive and found it a lot cheaper to get taxi s to Dubai ina Walk and eat at the various restuarants or in the Malls  In the evenings and weekends the hotel lobby areas etc are just manic and having to fight the crowds Would I go back   NO  There are better and cheaper hotels out there  
No place for penny pinching    Just stayed at Atlantis Dubai for   nights enroute to London     this place is definitely a once in a lifetime must see experience  however  it is the most expensive hotel one could imagine  we were lucky to be treated by some very generous friends and enjoyed the whole stay  The service was impeccable  the breakfast was magnificent  so much choice  amp  negated the need for lunch  which is a good thing if u want to save money  The foyer  amp  halls  the aquarium  the restaurants  amp  bars were ssooo beautiful  We used the gym  amp  found it to be well equipped  the hotel pool area is also a good place to relax  There are a lot of young children around   it was school hols  but this may bother some  I think they have a deal for under   s  Also one more complaint  wi fi cost around    AUD   hrs  
N =>   OVER PRICED AND NOT WORH IT    the atlantis dubai seriously disappoints  there is nothing to rave about the hotel right from the service to the food to the rooms are all very bad   went to the lebanese restaurant and have never had worse lebanese    same for the italian     i would give it zero stars    
N =>   save your money  This was our  rd family holiday in Dubai  We took our   and   year old and my mum of     First year at Jebel Ali and we had a great time  apart from uncomfortable beds no complaints   excellent personal service  Last year we stayed at Al Qasr  This had the vow facotor  A little impersonal and food was not great but everything else was excellent  highly recommend it  This il we stayed at the Atlantis for    nights  On arrival we did not receive the customary welcome but our rooms were ready immediately  We had booked   rooms and requested that they would be as close as possible  We were on  th floor and my mum was on   th  One of the rooms was in a poor location  dark and dingy  We requested a new room and were told that it was not possible  Upon talking to someone else  we got a room that was slightly better but not one we requested  there were   of us in the   room and yet all facilities provided were for    you cannot go anywhere without showing your card key  infact they have made it easy by giving you a little holder you can wear around your neck  there are not any stairs and the lifts were always full  at most times we had to wait atleat   minutes for a lift which lacked a fan aircon  Of all the times we have holidayed we never had to queue for breakfast  after     am be prepared to wait in a very long queue  Also be prepared to wait a very long time for tea and coffee  forget about refills  It was over crowded  amp  the hotel grounds could not cope  Not enough sunbeds or even space for additional sunbeds by the pool  At one point we were told to come back later  the beach is made up of poor quality grit  It is essential for kids to wear shoes  Lots of broken shells and concrete  The water was stagnant  After     pm the pool and the beach falls in the shade of the massive hotel and the air becomes cold  the buildng also acts as a wind deflector so around the pool it does get windy  booking for dinner is essential  food was great  no little treat at turn down time  The water park was great and a god send  But essential to get there before   am or forget getting a bed or even a rings tubes  Children s club far too expanive  Expect long queues  atleast half hour waits  at the reception and conceirge  It can also be noisy if your room faces the main road at front of hotel and if you are facing the pool area  The unacceptable noise  however  was from the cleaners  During the night they would slam doors shut and have a full on conversation whilst you are trying to sleep  They would even knock on your door at  am to see if you want your room cleaned  One occassion we returned to our room from the beach dripping wet  running late for our dinner reservation and the cleaner would not let us in  We were told that we had to wait    minutes until they were finished  After   minutes of standing in the hallway  I took the kids into the bathroom for their wash whilst they cleaned the room at     pm  Morning of our departure  I requested help to remove our cases from the rooms  We agreed the time but no one turned up  Upon calling several times  we were informed that there was no one to help  so with   kids  we had to move our   suitcases in an over crowded lift which we had to wait over    minutes for  This hotel has cut too many corners and does not offer those essential serives that is provided in   star hotels let alone a   star  It is a grand hotel with great decor  It is a good place to visit but I can think of lots of other better places to stay  Do recommend the water park and the dolphin bay  
N =>   This resort has something for everyone  We stayed here for one night to celebrate my wife s birthday  We had our    month old daughter with us as well  Booked an Imperial Club room and got upgraded to a Regal Suite  It was simply an unbelievable room  Large ensuite with a jacuzzi tub  A living room with an office area to the side as well as a bar  The bedroom had a lounge area to the side with an L shaped couch Service was ok as the staff is still not fully trained  They try their best though which is more than you can say for some places The beach was massive and clear blue water with white sand  Aquaventure was impressive but I would pass on the Lost Chambers if it was not included with the room Food in the Imperial Club was ok with good service  We ate at Kaleidoscope which was better than most family oriented buffets  Nobu looked pretty cool but we did not go as our daughter was not so co operative at the restaurant All in all  a great facility for a weekend or   or   days  An entire week could be a bit much unless driving into the city is not an issue  
N =>  Amazing Expensive Experience     Right from the time we arrived the experience was amazing and fantastic  The check in was quick and the luggage reached our room before we could  though was a bit concerned after reading the reviews here    The room was pretty well made and almost perfect except for the toileteries which seemed very cheap stuff  The Aquaventure was a great experience and we went there twice during our stay  The breakfast at both the restaurants was fantastic but i feel Saffron had more variety  One thing we didnt like was that the public areas was alwyas teeming with crowds and didnt give that exclusive feel for such a grand property  The hotel staff were excellent and the entire property was well made and maintained  The restaurants were really expensive as well the bars  The location of the hotel at the tip of this wonderful island was pretty good and everything looked so out of this world that our stay for   days just got over before i realised it  I will definitely like to come back but as there are other good properties in Dubai    i would like to experience their hospitality before visiting again  Due to the large size of the hotel i felt the warmth of a   star experience was somewhere missing But overall a wonderful experience   one to remember for sometime to come  
N =>   How we got Maximal Value out of this expensive but beautiful resort We were transited through Dubai from Canada to Asia  We decided to spent three days in Dubai to see what everyone was talking about  We spent a good deal of time researching the various reviews  and following the various forums   which were very helpful   Thank you  quot Latimer  quot After all this research  we decided that we really wanted to experience Atlantis  The problem in my mind was the value for the money we were spending  Considering that almost the same resort in the Bahamas is a   hour flight away from us  and is priced at nearly half the price as the Dubai Atlantis  we opted to maximize our time  and minimize the cost as much as possbile As mentioned  we spent three nights in Dubai  However  we only spent one of those nights at Atlantis  You may think that shuttling between three hotels in three days is hassle  and it is  a bit  I think we lost about an hour of our time in Dubai because of this  However  the difference in price saved us about        USD  and our non Atlantis hotel was very close to the airport which made for a convenient departure We arrived in Dubai on Tuesday afternoon  checked into our hotel in Deira  I ll write another reveiw about that one   and then promptly starting checking out Dubai  including ski dubai  The next morning  we had breakfast  checked out of our first hotel  and checked into Atlantis by about        Again  after reading the reviews  we felt the imperial club would be the best value for the two adults and our two children aged   and    Considering a can of   up costs approximitely     and a cup of tea was closer to      I think was a good deal Since we checked in early  they only had    rooms booked that day   we were shown the club lounge  and then promptly had something to eat  We then headed off to the waterpark for a fun filled day  As the sun was setting  we went over to the Dolphin area followed by some relaxing time by the beach    these beaches are no carribean by any stretch of the imagination  but the little fish on the shoreline and the abundant shells kept our kids happy We went back to the room  got ready  and then headed off to the lounge  We had missed afternoon tea  which I am told included sandwhiches  The afternoon snacks were plenty for us  They had a chef who made a wonderful smoked salmon appetizer  We are not big eaters   especially our kids  and this was more than enough for us to eat to consider this dinner  Later in the evening  we strolled down to the lounge to get some hot chocolate and some more snacks  The staff at the lounge were kind enough to deliver this to our room for us  which was a nice touch  They did the same thing in the morning when we requested a morning cup of tea    freshly brewed from loose tea leaves After  quot dinner quot   we went down to the lost chambers  and had a great time looking at the various exhibits here  A true highlight to our visit The next morning we woke up early and had a choice of two restaurants  or the lounge for breakfast  Despite the great reviews about the restaurants  we decided to eat in the lounge  We ate on the balcony overlooking the waterpark and the ocean  an enjoyed a full buffet  included eggs  bacon  toast  pastries  pancakes  juices  coffee tea  cheeses  etc  This was more than plenty for us The staff at the lounge provided me with a laptop so that I could check and respond to e mails  You get free WiFi with the imperial club  but need to request a password  It was much less hassle for the staff to just give me the computer for as long as I needed it The waterpark opens at       am  so in the meantime  we went to the pool  which was quiet and quite relaxing  Close to       we headed off for our second round at the waterpark  We spent another couple of hours there  went back to the lounge for some lunch  packed and checked out by       We were told that the kids club was included with the lounge  and almost put the kids into it while we packed  but they were content just hanging out with us We left Dubai early next morning from our hotel in Deira  enjoying our trip to Atlantis and Dubai  The resort itself is beautiful  The staff is curteous and helpful  The rooms are a good size  and very clean  The beds are comfortable  The lounge is well stocked  and worth every penny to considering the price of food and drinks elsewhere   you also get a higher floor for your room with better views of the palm  The aquarium is amazing and the lost chambers are fantastic  I would go back  When our kids truly appreciate fine food  we would consider a longer stay as to try out the various restaurants  Until then  I think one night is enought to get a lot out of the resort  
N =>   Absolutely amazing  I took my husband to Dubai for his   th Birthday as a surprise and chose the Atlantis to stay in  What a fantastic choice  The hotel is absolutely amazing  the service is exceptional the room was wonderful and the buffet breakfast is just out of this world  I can not praise the hotel enough  Wonderful pool  lovely views  great water park  fantastic club and the staff are so accommodating  It took me a long while to decide which hotel I was going to choose to stay at and I am absolutely thrilled with the decision that I made  My husband said that this was probably the best experience of his life other than having our children  I don t think you can possibly beat that  This was a fantastic time to go to Dubai the temperature was perfect and the pools were really quiet  If taking a trip to Dubai I would highly recommend the culinary flight at the Burg Al Arab this was an amazing experience  don t eat to many nuts in the sky bar at the beginning as each course of the meal was huge and we were struggling by the end   Take a trip over Dubai in a seaplane as this will take your breath away  The jeep safari to a beduin camp in the desert is definately one to try as this was thoroughly enjoyable  I would highly recommend Arabian adventures for your trips as their service was impeccable  Avoid arabia horizons like the plague as they are absolutely hopeless  I would say that you could not possibly beat this hotel in any way  I would recommend this hotel to any one for a trip of a lifetime  
N =>   Amazing place   pricey but nearly faultless  Slightly apprehensive after reading a few other comments but stay was perfect    Rooms  amp  bathroom clean and wholesome  Well built hotel so no sound through walls  Friendly helpful staff  Expensive but as expected  Waterpark excellent  Swimming pools  amp  beach excellent  Aquarium brilliant 
N =>   Never Again I am a frequent traveler to Dubai and when i heard about a new and exciting grand hotel is going to open  i thought   why not    My  why not  changed to   WHY OH WHY  as soon as i got there  The lobby was very nice and there were many staff at hand  But soon as i got to my room i was shocked by the blandness of the decor  It followed no theme  white walls and plain fittings  I went to sleep hoping that the rest of the hotel will make up for the rooms failure  I woke up and went for breakfast  The buffet was nice and there was alot of variety so i ate well  After breakfast i realised that the hotel was full of tourists who had come to see the aquarium  I quickly realised that  if your looking for a luxury hotel  this is not one  It is a tourist attraction and it shouldnt be classed as a five star resort  The plus sides of my visit were the water park  which was practically empty  And the Dolphin Interaction was worth every penny  But you dont have to stay here to enjoy these things  I did get to see a few celebrities as i was there for the grand opening but i imagine they are not going to be back too soon either If you want true luxury Dubai style  I recommend the Madinat Jumierah  Dar al masyaf to be more precise  
N =>  Dubai is a ghost city and Atlantis a huge disappointment Dubai is unfortunately not what it used to be  Many areas are now half deserted  The service has also declined significantly everywhere but at the Atlantis it was a complete disaster  Impresonnal and uncaring  As soon as we arrived we discovered that they lost our suitcases and   hours later they still did not know where they put them  Four hours later they arrived   The place felt like a hotel factory or a large half empty airport  The fish and in particulaqr the dolphins were a real joy  Although we got the room on a pay   stay   offer  we still found that we overpaid  
N =>  Never ever again to Atlantis After reading many negative comments we decided to go ahead as we had booked in ruary for our ember trip  We have been to Dubai before so know what to expect having stayed at Jumeriah beach hotel twice before over the very busy christmas period with no problems what so ever  What a shock we were in for  The hotel is stunning to look at but it ends there  The staff were mainly rude and very unhelpful and many couldn t understand your requests for drinks and meals so half the time you didn t get what you asked for  Food and drink was extremley expensive and there were   of us  Kids club  internet access  everthing was an extra costThe rooms were made up but the toiletries  water etc were never replaced despite many many requests  No newspapers  choclates on turn down absolutely NOTHING  We had   deluxe rooms and this applied to all not just one room  Water park was great but very busy due to non hotel guests  The beach was very poor with sharp coral as opposed to lovely golden sand  I could go on but I am sure you get my drift by now  We love Dubai but not the Atlantis  Jumeriah beach hotel every time  If you have not been to Dubai before you will have nothing to compare Atlantis too so you wont want to go again  Go elsewhere and enjoy 
N => 	  glitches Well  the title might sound a bit harsh and they actually didn t screw up on everything  but the overall impression after a   nights stay was very dissapointing That Dubai is  too  expensive  is commonly known  but the value for what you pay in Atlantis is just miserable  But maybe you shouldn t compare to what you are used to of service and standards in western  star hotels when staying there  The fact that they have only opened some months ago  might also play in their favour but still I will never stay there again when in Dubai  I could write a long list with unexcusable shortcomings in service and response to customer requests  but I rather state the good points  The food in all outlets  especially Rostang  Ossiano  Nobu and the Italian  forgot the name   were really topclass  not so much the service though   be avoid the breakfastbuffet if you don t fancy hordes of unbehaved local kids running around and throwing with food   I guess that my Dubai partner that had to wait   minutes for the valet to find his car after our lunch at Nobu won t return neither to Atlantis any soon  By the way  my luggage dissapeared when I checked out  I had to wait   minutes for it to be found and almost missed my flight  No more comments    
N =>   Watch out    Went to Atlantis for a New Year with my wife and   children  The first problem start in the airport  I booked a mini van with Atlantis concierge to pick us up in the airport  Guess what  no mini van  Ok  we had to leave our luggage in the airport because it did not feet in the regular car and go to the hotel  Our luggage arrived a few hours later  I would not be a problem  but we were charged for   transfers instead of one  For minivan and for regular car  very nice  The staff in the hotel dose not speak much English  make shore that they understood you  because you my get a glass of vodka instead a glass of water  The new year party that we had to book was      per adult and      per child  that what we were told at the time of reservation  When I got the bill at the last day of our stay  the New Year charge was        I spend about one hour speaking to a few hotel employees until they reduce the charge to         I paid the bill   which was not cheap for   days            and left the hotel  A few weeks later I received my American Express bill and I saw   charges from Atlantis Hotel  One for         that I paid and another one for        I called Atlantis to find out what is it for  but could not get any answer  I called my American express and put a stop payment on this charge  American Express send a request to Atlantis and their answer was that this charge was for   th of ember  because they did not charge me for that day  I MADE A RESERVATION FROM THE   TH OF DECEMBER ORIGINALLY AND I ARRIVED TO DUBAI ON THE   TH OF DECEMBER  THE ARRIVAL STAMP IN MY PASSPORT IS   TH OF DECEMBER    Can you imagine that  They are trying to get you every and any way they can    WATCH OUT    
N =>   Underwhelming and overpriced My wife and I have been very much looking forward to staying at the Atlantis based on the pictures we had seen of the place  However  it proved to be a very underwhelming experience  The hotel is at best   star   but it unfortunately carries a   star price tag  The deluxe room was no more than a basic business hotel room  with paper thin walls  I knocked on the walls and they are basically veneer  not brick  Despite informing the hotel we were honeymooning  we were placed next to a family with noisy kids  Hotel food was very average and the Aquaventure is no where near what it looks like on the marketing materials  eg there was only   shark in the tank    However  what was most annoying about this place was the fact that everything was an extra charge   including AER    to use the spa and sauna facilities  unless you had pre booked an expensive massage   Staff were generally friendly but service standards patchy   on our first night  the turn down service seemed to ruffle up our beds and one of our pillows looked like it had been slept on even  The one highlight however was the Lost Chambers aquarium display   with the baby whale shark   that was very good  However  not enough to make up for many deficiencies elsewhere and we would not recommend this place at all  We however moved on to the Angsana Hotel and Suites  which by contrast is absolutely fantastic place to stay  
N =>  think they have their act together now So  arrived Dubai arrivals at      local worrying about the   diazepam I have in my bag  for back problems  as am sure I shall get locked up for being a drug dealer  Fears over  sail through immigration  next port taxi to Atlantis please  Thanks to TA reviews  exit left from the airport to be greeted by a fleet of beige and yellow cabs  Now  start calculating the exchange       aed    aed straight on the meter for a night fare plus our journey which I guestimate to be    mins  Arrive Atlantis near on    minutes exactly thanks to Stirling Moss our cab driver and parted with   aed including a round up to nearest  aed  not bad  I make that less than twenty quid Ok  so it s now around the     am mark and our bags are whisked away by a bellman and we re shown to the Imperial Club VIP check in by another equally polite and attentive gentleman  For those of you pondering a visit to Atlantis  I know it s far from a cheap local hotel but  if I could make one recommendation with regards to Imperial club  If you intend to spend a fair bit of time at the hotel and given the facilities I would suggest you probably will  consider the extra cost for Imperial club  Imperial Club guests  once parted of and extra      approx for an average stay will qualify for copious extras in the way of food and beverages  Given the cost of eating and drinking in hotels in Dubai  this proved to be money well spent as the Imperial lounge offered food from  am  massive breakfasts  to sushi  cakes  pastries  cold meats  cheese  fruit  tea  coffee and alcohol right up to   pm  all included in the Imperial upgrade cost Now  having read the early TA post on Atlantis  I must admit to being tempted by staying off the island at say the Jumeirah beach hotel  Early Atlantis reviewers  even though they had been fortunate enough to have had the luxury of a massive discount on room rates  were scathing of the fact that the resort wasn t quite finished and service was far from attentive  Please note that the hotel had a soft opening to bring staff up to speed  no easy task when you have around      rooms and a smilar amount employed encompassing around    nationalities After a two hour nap  assessment of our room   very comfortable  a shower and a massive breakfast at the imperial lounge  I was ready to explore From the outset  climbing from our cab on arrival  the staff were  courteous  attentive  without being subservient and very accommodating  In fact I would suggest that given early reviews  perhaps Atlantis is overstaffed to appease the early negative reviews In a nutshell  staff        cleanliness of hotel        general facilities  giant aquarium  water park         The only criticism of my experience at Atlantis would be the dolphins  you don t get to swim with them but understand that this is due to change about mid       the photo s cost a fortune and its not a    minute experience as one is led to believe       Hope this helpsAvinaggAka Ken 
Nice to be pampered at the Atlantis Palm My wife and i stayed at the Atlantis Palm for   nights in november      just before the official opening We had a luxury room with a large balcony with   sun loungers overlooking the pool and the sea You can t fault everything that this hotel has to offer The attention they give you is superb The pool area was excellent with more than adequate numbers of sunbeds and the same also goes for the beach area and everywhere was kept spotlessly clean We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay here and would love to visit again some time soon The breakfast that was included was first class in every aspect and the restaurant was a delight Evening meals were expensive as were all the drinks however as this was a special occasion and we knew before hand that it was not going to be cheap we didn t mind The adventure park is free to guests and you can spend a great day in there although it can get very busy at times as non guests can pay to come in and use this facility I would definitely recommend this hotel as a treat or special occasion as long as you are aware it can be very expensive Taxis are cheap enough into Dubai City from the hotel and you could eat out there a lot cheaper if you wanted to The monorail due for completion this year        from the hotel will make access to other areas easier and more interesting Dubai is a great place to visit and is both friendly and safe This was our third visit to Dubai and we love it I would recommend a day out on the open top bus which takes you to all the places of interest around Dubai the ticket allows you to hop on and off the bus when you like Also a trip along Dubai creek on a Dhow boat with an evening meal is a must  
N =>   fabulous resort The Atlantis delivered all it promised to be  It s big  it s brash  there s been no expense spared   exactly what you expect from a luxury Dubai hotel  The service was great  They certainly seemed to have ironed out any teething problems they may have had when it opened Everything is expensive though  Coffee was    a cup and I daren t even think what we paid for a gin and tonic  We ate in the hotel   nights and for the other nights we took a taxi to the shopping malls  and ate there  There s lots of choice  so a very easy option Taxis were cheap   and it s the only thing that was    about    to get to Emirates Mall The aquarium at Atlantis is amazing  and never ceased to entertain us  The Goliath Groupers have to be seen to be believed The Aquadventure waterpark is great for children and dads  I found the rides far too scary  and tended to relax with a book on my sunbed instead  Also  beware  ladies  I managed to burn holes in my bikini bottom  due to the impact on landing down some of those water slides Another thing about the waterpark   the lockers are     each  I paid for two  but found we could get all our stuff into one  However  they would not refund the     for the locker I didn t use  This was such a rip off  we still haven t got over it  Anyway  if you don t take valuables  you don t need a locker  you can leave your things on the sunbeds Would like to return to Atlantis  just need to save up first  
N =>   Very grand but no heart When we arrived in Dubai our transfer never turned up to collect us  Had to hunt round for someone to help us  there were other families which were staying at Atlantis who had also been abandoned  Evently got sortedwith a transfer  On arrival at the hotel we checked in had a deluxe room  which had   double beds in  We were traveling with our   children   and     room was big enough for all of us  and lovely bathroom  Our friends who were traveling with us same set up   adults   children  They were taken through to VIP area  We didn t find out till we saw them the next day the hotel didn t even have their booking and were kept hanging around for   hours  His room was evently sorted out  The hotel said they d sort out a rate for him  Breakfast was a scrum down with massive queues  Everything you can think of though was there  Giant chocolate fountain  which my   year old took a look at Lots of sun beds no truble getting one Dolphin bay very good  lots of information we hadn t heard before on other dolphin experiences   good for a first time or with young children Waterpark very good   gets very busy   we also had our bag disappear with our room cards and money in but it turned up at the end of the day in a different area  Kids went to the kids club only once its very very expensive  not Jumerea beach Lunches at shore and wave restaurants were again very expensive and no service  there are lots of waiters and staff around but nobody seems to know what to do  This applies to all the hotel  Spa   my husband went to use the steam room   oh sir thats extra       There seems to be alot of that too  oh thats extra for the power plate in the gym Booked my treatment the first full day we had there  Thought it would be busy being New Year  Booked treatment  When I went for massage they didn t have it  Then they said they d sort it out  Go and get changed etc  Then they said they couldn t again  Evently had a treatment  Next door to treatment room people talking really loadly running a bath  Left cold after treament too Just not impressed at all New years Eve fireworks were cancelled due to fighting in gazza Which was fine  Buffet very good not much for kids though  My husband ate a bad lobster didn t realize it shouldn t smell of ammonia and was ill for the rest of the holiday Our friend on check out had been over charged         didn t even get an apology Sun was out though which is what we went for  Had good time with our friends and family  But not the Dubai we ve been going to for the last    years  
N =>    HOTEL     SERVICE   PRICES We stayed at the atlantis from the   th dec until  th jan  myself my wife and my   girls aged   and     as we drove onto the palm and saw the hotel it was wow we arrived and were greeted by lobby staff bags out of car and into reception within minutes the reception lobby area was grand but i have seen better  we booked into the imperial club which had a seperate checking in area it was ok i found out after there is a vip lounge to check but it was not open arrived at   am  we were ckecked in and in our rooms within    mins  the rooms were very clean but nothing special  bathroom door opened into the bedroom     quot lcd all the rest was basic  the imperial was on the   th floor  i advise if you book the imperial club ask for the   th floor other you will be in and out of the lift  my impression of the club was excellent well worth the     dirhams per day extra  staff snacks serviceand the cocktail hour between  pm and  pm where most acholic drinks we complimentary   soft drinks and snacks are comp all day the hotel itself the lobby aqaurium shops were to busy for my liking from   am till   pm hundredes of visitors the water park was excellent for all of us especially in the morning no queing got busy from midday onwards  there were comp buggys to take you to and from every  or  mins  never used the beach but it looked very nice with bean bags and sun beds every where  the pools were great first couple of days we spent at the royal towers pool very quite and then we went to the zero pool kds loved it around the pool there was a trampoline basket ball net   pingpong tables all comp  the pol itself was vast with a basket ball net also at appr   pm the pool started to heat it was brill  the food in and around the pool was ok and expensive  there are   tennis courts which were free to use but you had to hire the rackets not a problem  but then you had to buy the balls  what a con   the restaurants  we ate in most of them  seafire was the best for me the steaks were out of this world service was very good aswell       next Michel Rostang very good next Giorgio Locatelli not very good at allservice was none exsitant had to ask all the time until i called the manager then it was the best ever  next nobu everything fantastic next Levantine we went here for breakfast god food service was ok  not   standards by a long way the atmosphere was very hectic  for breakfast aswell next the Saffron same atmsphere as the levantine but the service was a lot beter and the food was ten tims better  next lunchtime which we ate either at the water park useally water park food   or round by the pool we ate pool side bars not   at all  the kids club i refused to put my girls in there as it was     a session   two sessions a day  never known a hotel to charge for kids club my over all expereince of the atlantis excellent staff nothing was a problem for them  very very very expensive  i have stayed in just as good for a lot less i would not recommend this hotel under  s apart from the pool as there was nothing for them   i think i have covered everything apart from saying a BIG BIG THANK YOU TO RIO AND WALTER in the imperial club 
N =>   Give it a try   we found it great  We  husband and I  stayed at The Atlantis for   days   th    th ember  We travelled with Virgin to Dubai on a two centre holiday  Mauritius being the second destination  Sorry for delay in posting review but computer broke and just had repaired Never visited Dubai before so do not know how The Atlantis compares with other   star hotels  so can only go by what we found Arrived about   am so did not expect to have a room straight away  Went to reception and were given wallets so that we could access The Atlantis guest areas whilst we waited for room  Our baggage was put into the storage area and went to hospitality area to get changed  In no time my husband informed me that a member of staff had found him and told him our room was available  so quick change and back to reception  Went through necessary formalities very quickly and went to storage area to collect luggage  Told bell boys we didn t mind taking our own luggage but one came out immediately and showed us to our room  We had only booked a deluxe room but what we had we were very impressed with  not ostentatious but plainly furnished  Think however we may have been upgraded because our room was on a higher level  Everything we had asked for kingsize bed  non smoking room and with great views looking out to the sea  Jumeirah beach area and above the tank  with a good size balcony to sit out on  We were impressed with the large bathroom and shower cubicle but felt that as the bathroom was so large instead of just an ordinary bath tub the bathroom could have accommodated a slightly larger bath tub with a jaccuzzi at very little extra expense  We were left complimentary chocolates  huge box  and bottle of wine after our first night Other tripadvisors have criticised the staff  but we found that all the staff we had dealings with were very helpful and efficient  Perhaps they had been re trained since the hotel opened  we certainly did not encounter any problems The food in the restaurants we visited was very good  The breakfast buffets were excellent with everything you could possibly want  We went to both the Saffron and Kaleidoscope  In the evening we ate in the Seafire steak restaurant  Ronda Locatelli Italian and the buffet at the Saffron  The steaks in the Seafire were excellent  the buffet excellent  but we were disappointed with the Italian  very small portions which meant we had no trouble eating three courses  The restaurants were expensive but you would be naive to think that they would be anything else We visited Aquaventure for some part of every day we were there and think it is an excellent water park and we have visited many  We re not in our first throws of youth  and rode all the rides except the Leap of Faith which we could not pluck up courage to do We went to the old part of Dubai by taxi and found no trouble at all picking up a taxi from outside the hotel It is good that you can use all the guest facilities even after you have checked out and the hospitality room is excellent We enjoyed ourselves very much at The Atlantis  We do intend visiting Dubai in the future when the monorail is in operation and would visit The Atlantis again if the price was right but will probably try another hotel on Jumeirah Beach just so we can compare Hope this review helps in some way  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to email me  
N =>  Glad we didn t change our minds I have just arrived back after a week at the Atlantis with a friend  We booked quite a few months back and were a little concerned about the reports coming out during the Atlantis soft launch and were at one point considering changing our hotel  but after our experience there we are both very glad we didn t Hopefully this will ally some fears from previous reports of experiences that have happened there We took the red eye to Dubai and were not expecting to be able to check in until later in the day  However  after arriving at     am our room was ready and we checked in about   mins  Although we were not shown to our rooms we had clear and concise directions in how to get to our room in the East Tower  I do not have a great sense of direction but we were able to find our room with ease  Luggage arrived   mins later and within an hour of arriving we were eating breakfast over looking the Royal swimming pool We did have to call guest services on a couple of occasions and both issues resolved promptly and professionally We have stayed at   other Dubai hotels in the past and whilst the Atlantis doesn t add up to the   star of the Al Qazar  what it does trump is    Activities and things to do and see    Amount of staff willing and able to help you  The staff here on every level were courteous  professional and knowledgeable  On one occasion I asked something out of the ordinary and was told  nothing is impossible here   This mentality seemed to echo from everybody we dealt with Taxi s were in abundance which we managed to get within a couple of minutes  the only exception was the Saturday we tried to venture out and had to wait   hr  however  this has also happened previous years in Dubai due to the taxi shortage they experience The room was lovely and spacious and we had no problems with day cleaning or the evening turn down service  A couple of times the lifts were busy but the maximum wait was a couple of minutes After reading reports about restaurant bookings we pre booked our restaurants a couple of weeks before our arrival  This was done by emailing the reservations desk directly at the hotel  Nobu was great and I would highly recommend but Locetti was disappointing  we were expecting something a little bit more Italian market but felt this was just a mid range pizza pasta place  We were there when occupancy was quite low  we would have estimated somewhere in between        over the week   although it really feels the hotel feels like it had turned a corner and the staff a lot more confident in their ability to satisfy the customer and hopefully this is what is needed when they are running at higher occupancy Some other takeaways   The aquarium is totally amazing and superseded our expectations  we probably spent     hr a day there just watching the fish swimming around  For total relaxation  try the hammocks between the swimming pool and beach  It is so peaceful and away from the hustle and bustle of the pools  Saffron was by far the better place for breakfast  it seemed a lot more chilled and better managed  We couldn t find a toaster in Kaleidoscope but our waitress did help us out by getting some from the kitchen  
N =>   Absolute Paradise I had a short break at this fantastic hotel  booked as a suprise gift for me for my birthday  Whow what a present it turned out to be  Before my partner and I set off  we had read some pretty negative reviews about this brand new hotel  but we went with an open mind  intent on making our own opinion of the Atlantis  All i can say is   this place is out of this world  There wasn t one thing that we could fault  The staff are all extremely accomodating and went out of their way to ensure our stay was a good one  The hotel itself is like no other we ve stayed in    attention to detail was second to none  Food was excellent and the attractions within the hotel were first class We cannot wait to return there in the future  We had a fantastic weekend  
N =>  Atlantis made our visit to Dubai a great one   Stayed there during the grand opening of the hotel and all i can say was a big WOW   we ended the night of our vacation with fireworks  not a simple one but the best i had ever seen  We were not at the party as those were for the invited guests only but we got the chance to see it live on the TV in our room  Some areas during that day was closed to inhouse guest but they had managed to provide alternatives to us  instead of using the Royal Pool  we were then moved to the Zero Entry pool  Beach access is open as well for us  Staffs are very polite and helpful  towels were readily available  We were able to eat on the restaurants that we had booked  NOBU has always been at its best  AQUAVENTURE was fantastic  great unique rides  Lost chambers was amazing  love so much the different marine species in there  Guest Services were very prompt on our request  i wonder how they made it that quick when they have more than a thousand rooms that night occupied  We checked out the following day and requested for luggage assistance and was done promptly  We paid so much as we were staying their for a week  but it was worth it  not tired of shopping in the Avenues    And just a couple of minutes ago  my mom called our travel agent to book our family by march next year to celebrate my twin brother s birthday  and i can t wait to go back   
N =>   Great   but expensive  We stayed in an Atlantis room for   nights from  th ember  This was not our first choice of hotel and were apprehensive after reading the reviews The hotel is HUGE and I would say it s got the wow factor Check in was very quick and Myles who checked us in was very efficient and helpful  The room was very nice and bathroom was lovely  Only difference from Atlantis room to Deluxe is the full balcony  as opposed to a French one  so perhaps not really worth the price difference The Lost Chambers is fantastic and the Aquaventure is really good  although I don t think any better than Wild Wadi  There are many visitors around the hotel at all times  not just guests and it always seems very busy  We ate in the Seafire restaurant on the first night and had booked well in advance  It was very nice  but steaks not as amazing as I would have thought  considering how expensive it was  We ate breakfast in Saffron each morning and we didn t have to queue and you really could get almost anything you wanted to eat  Service was great On our third night we ate in Nobu and this was the nicest meal of our whole holiday  better value than Seafire and our waiter  who came from Nobu in Las Vegas  was so helpful and provided excellent service  The food was fantastic On our final day we had lunch by the pool  service was good but at     for   burgers and   Ups  very expensive  We had room service on final night and this was delivered in    mins and service very good The sea is clear  but the beach is not really very nice in comparison to Jumeirah I would recommend this hotel for families and although I wouldn t go back  I m really glad I ve been  
N =>   Dont worry We stayed at Atlantis for   nights from   th ember  As others we were concerned because of the previous trip advisor reviews We need not have worried as none of the main complaints affected us We found no queues anywhere our rooms were cleaned on time to perfection  the staff were all extremely helpful the facilities fantastic even though the Royal pool was closed due to Kylies visit  We do understand what people have said about the staff perhaps being inexperienced but they were never rude and if anything perhaps just lacked confidence We asked for a room overlooking the ocean but on hindsight the view over the Palm is more dramatic and interesting Ossiano very expensive but worth it for a treat  Seafire best steak ever  Levatine good food fanastic terrace  We had a fantatsic weekend and would love to return sometime  
N =>   We didn t have any problems   great holiday  We stayed at the Atlantis early in ember and had a great time  Admittedly we had never been to Dubai before  but have travelled a lot  The staff could not have been more helpful  from the moment we stepped out of our taxi   we were checked in immediately  given a room upgrade and taken to our room where the bellboy pointed out all the features   all this at   am   Room was great   lovely bathroom  shower etc The whole place is very clean and the fish are just amazing   it took ages to get anywhere as we had to keep stopping to look at the fish  Enjoyed the Lost Chambers   had to go back a second time to take pictures  we went to Aquaventure  it was quite busy but there were no queues  and there were so many staff around who were all friendly and helpful  The sunbeds were very comfy and pool staff eager to help  The beach was a bit disappointing  needs a bit more sand  It was a shame that halfway through our stay the Royal Pool area was closed in order to get it ready for the Official Opening   but the zero entry pool was great too and still not crowded Breakfast buffets were brilliant  chocolate fountain for breakfast   and we did not have to queue at all   again staff very courteous and helpful  Restaurants are expensive  but very good quality   we booked from the UK  but I think we could have got into some without reservations as they did not all seem full  The Cold Stone Ice Creamery is fantastic   wish they would open some in the UK  It was very pleasant to sit on the Levantine Terrace for a drink in the evening Just a couple of niggles   the daily newsletter mentioned the regular bus to the Mall of the Emirates   but the staff all told us different times and locations   we ended up in a taxi   Also on our last day we found a brochure of lots of local trips that you could book through the hotel  though organised by a different company    if we had been given a copy when we arrived we would have been able to see more of Dubai We had read many reviews here before going and wondered what we were letting ourselves in for   yes it is huge and like a Disney Castle  but that is the point of it  And staff have obviously had a lot more training since the early reviews   but if you go on holiday and look at the negatives all the time  you will never enjoy anything  
N =>   Overhyped Overpriced I stayed at Atlantis for one night to celebrate my wifes birthday  I guess based on the Ad campaign we had high expectations but there are certain minimum levels of service one expects from a Hotel that charges      a night  Firstly  this hotel is too big and too impersonal to be termed  exclusive   We were given a room facing the construction site for the opening party setup  The constant noise made the room s balcony useless  The room itself was quite spacious with a lovely bathroom The main attractions are where the Hotel comes up short Lost chambers was highly disappointing   I feel for the people who would have actually paid for it   Aquaventure was nice but too lax about visitor safety  It is irritating trying to get a confirmed reservation at the celebrity chef restaurants especially when one realises that they are not full  We were told Nobu was fully booked but we had heard that Hotel reservations tries to be difficult so we just showed up when we felt like it and were seated immediately  None of the other retaurants were even half full  The worst part of my experience was the check out  There was an extra     charge that had no mention on my booking printout for which I asked for an explanation  I couldn t believe how rude the receptionist was  I felt like Oliver Twist asking for more Soup  Definitely not my moneys worth  
Never Again  My husband and I visited the Atlantis for   nights  th    th ember     Very disappointed with whole experience  We have travelled to Dubai many times over the last   years and have always had wonderful experiences with many hotels including Al Qasr  Jumeriah Beach  Royal Meridian  etc When we arrived at the Atlantis at about midnight on the Thursday start of weekend in Dubai  the hotel was packed with local people looking around and the reception was very busy  Nobody greeted us when we were dropped off and we had to struggle with our suitcases  We then waited at reception for about    mins  where we were given our room keys and a hotel map we then had to find our own room never had to do that before  The allocated room was a twin bedded room when we had booked a king  We phoned reception but they did not understand the problem so we had to go all the way back to reception and complain  We were told that the hotel was full and no king bedded rooms available my husband being able to speak arabic started shouting and eventually there gave us a king bedded room  The reception staff are very bad and not well trained  The hotel is not what I would describe as   star  I know the hotel is only new and maybe they are having teething problems but when you are paying upwards of      per night you expect a better service  The breakfast the next morning was mayhem everyone waiting for tables lots of noise not very good  but the food selection and quality was good  The main restaurants were always busy and you need to make a reservation and I thought they were overpriced  The water park is good and if you have children I am sure they will enjoy it  My advise is stay at another hotel and then buy a day pass for the water park and spend the day there  You can go into the hotel and look at the aquariums etc  This hotel is run like an american hotel and if you like good service and a bit of luxury don t stay at the Atlantis  if you like lots of people  noise and tack well maybe its for you  Lets hope it gets better  
N =>   Trouble free visit As others have said  we were really worried by earlier reviews  but needn t have been  Yes  it s OTT  it s huge  the decor is incredible and it s full of people   there are after all      rooms   but at no time did we ever feel overwhelmed by crowds  We took taxis everywhere   didn t wait for more than   minutes  The Royal Pool was closed  we had been forewarned by our travel agent because the Grand Opening is coming up next week   The zero entry pool is delightful and so safe and we had our pick of dozens of sunbeds  Breakfast in Saffron   what a choice of items   all kinds of cuisines catered for  We did not have dinner in any of the hotel restaurants   hubby is vegetarian  and naturally Seafire  Nobu etc all lean towards meat and fish  We ate out in Dubai  Having been warned about problems with bills  we paid everything   coffees  drinks  ice cream at ColdStone Creamery  fabulous  in cash  The only thing which really surprised us was  at check in the receptionist took a credit card charge for      dirhams  approx       and told us that would offset any charges during our visit and that any balance would be re credited to our credit card  Have never had this in any other hotel  Having paid all extras in cash  our hotel bill for bed and breakfast was prepaid  we made absolutely sure that we got the      dirham charge refunded  To sum up  we found the staff to be unfailingly polite and helpful  and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Atlantis Palm  
Not in the same league as the Jumeirah chain We had   nights at the Atlantis and found the following  Bad points  Beach is terrible and left blisters on my   year old toes  Queues for taxis at peak hour     mins one night   Building works and drilling on the lobby roof all day  No personal touches like  chocolate on pillow at turndown  no iced water at the pool  no fruit kebabs and such things which are all normal in the Jumeirah beach  Mina a salam  and Al Qusar   Massive hotel  too big too busy   Ugly views  the palm is unattractive and they are still building and working all day long  even when building works are finished  i cant see it being any better  you will then be looking out at houses and high rise apartment blocks  and its only a stones throw from the Atlantis  beach   Whale shark was far too big for his tank   No more than pre packed sandwhiches by the zero entry pool  No hot drinks and plastic glasses Good points  No wait for checking in and we were shown to our rooms by a very friendly and helpful bellboy   Beautiful room  lovely decor  only had a juliet balcony which you could just about put your foot on  no chairs on balconies   floris toiletries  well stocked mini bars and complimentary teas  coffee  and hot chocolates   Good maid service and turn down service  which only come in if the light is turned on for them to do so  forgot a few times to switch it over and the room wasnt done  no instructions to do this  we managed to work this out after a few days    Pool areas are lovely and never seem busy  too many beds  which were unused  Very clean and lots of heplful staff around to tuck big fluffy towels onto the beds   Waterpark was fantastic  we spent alot of time in here  being taken in directly by a little golf buggy  Although we had to walk miles back along the beach as the buggys dont pick up     Waterpark was better and cleaner than the wild wadi   Fish tanks are amazing and it was a treat every morning looking in on the whale shark  who i did feel sorry for   the many smaller sharks and many many different fish  and the divers who cleaned the tank and entertained the kids more than the fish  Stunning  Went to the lost Chambers as it was free but wasnt that impressed  the Blue Planet in Chester is much better   Room service was fantastic  beautiful food  well presented and very quick  and the wine was cheaper than anywhere else Restaurants  Kaleidoscope   Modern decor  had breakfast on the first morning queued for   mins and then it felt like a busy Disney hotel  everyone rushing to eat as much as they could in the quickest time  didnt go back Saffron   No queues at Saffron  only it was miles away from our rooms in the East tower  our rooms being in the West tower  but worth the walk  as it was just by the big fish tank and the decor was more traditional and more laid back and didnt seem as busy  We took breakfast here every morning and the food was very good and varied and the nice egg chef made me eggs benedict every morning on request We had an evening meal in Saffron and it has to be the best buffet style restaurant we have ever eaten in and quite reasonably priced Seafire   Beautiful steaks  well presented and served  Expensive  but only the same as any other good restaurant in Dubai  We went back to where we know most nights  Shimmers and the Al Muhna both at the Mina a Salam We enjoyed our holiday and the kids loved it  they didnt like the kids club and it costs a fortune  dont bother with it   the weather was fantastic  and we loved our time spent around Dubai  but we wouldnt go back to Atlantis  it is not in the same league as the above mentioned hotels  We have tried it  it wasnt as bad as we were expecting after the reviews and hopefully they may get it together  But it hasnt got the X factor  
N =>   Average Hotel     No much frills Located in downtown  Close to the airport  The check in was smooth  Lobby is average  Furniture in the lobby look tired  They have a restaurant  Coffee shop  adjascent to the lobby  Rooms were mediocre  I had a road facing room  Small  Not well maintained  House keeping services poor  Bathrooms just average  Amenities of average quality  Buffet breakfast was ok  Food was average  There was a Indian Club on the ground level  It did not look professional  Overall a Average Hotel  
N =>  Average i stayed here for   night the room was cleanand nice  but the food was     star  
N =>  Stay here you get complimentary PROBLEMS    We are a big group tour  We booked    rooms at this hotel during       FEB       Every room is confirmed by hotel  We also checked with hotel again on the morning of     and all rooms are confirmed  We arrived hotel at        Front office Manager told us that he had only    rooms for our group and the rest    rooms must be kicked out    Also  they give us the reason that it was SYSTEM ERROR   What the hell are they doing  Nobody came to solve our problem  We tried to call GM  Director  and Sales Manager but nobody came to meet our group Also  staffs were very poor  Most of staff are Indian and Philipino  They kept us waiting since               without any apology  Finally  we moved our group to other hotels  They don t even help us anything  TERRIBLE STAFF  amp  SERVICE   If you don t want to ruin your vacation or business trip in Dubai  DON T EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS HOTEL  There are so many good hotels in Dubai now  
N =>  A reasonable alternative Sorry that  quot Pierre quot  wasn t  quot Lucky quot  in his stay at the Avari  which is a part of a Pakistani chain   I was there the following week and I couldn t have been happier  Once upon a time one could stay at the Hyatt or Sheraton or Inter Con and still have a few dirhams left for shopping  but now Dubai is as over the  top as London  Paris  or Tokyo  and the hotel prices are just ridiculous for anyone not on an expense account  My travel agent booked me here  and I found it to be a great compromise between the   stars I yearn for and the   stars I dread  The rate was quite reasonable  My room  unlike Pierre s was was spacious  but not hugh  with a great king bed  flat screen TV  and all the stuff that makes a hotel comfortable  To me it was comparable to a Holiday Inn  I was pleased that the H AC functioned to perfection  since I needed both during my stay  The bath was suitably marblized  and the paper was a nice morning treat  I had also worried about the nightclub noise which vexed poor Pierre  Although the lobby was a bit raucous  the noise didn t make it up to me on an upper floor  The pub was actually quiet enough to do some work in My major disappointments were in the expensive room internet and an inferior albeit pricey buffet breakfast  runny scrambled eggs    Room service was better  Service was good  and the reception were very helpful  I ll be back  It s not Dubai s most posh  but it is a place where I think they will remember yu form one visit to the next  Fancy trying for that at one of the ultra luxe Burj wannabees  
N => loved it Everything about the Avari was good  I loved it all  The staff was more then kind  everyone from the staff in the resturant to the security in the parking  
N =>  Not bad at all    I stayed here for   nights in ober        the rooms were pleasant   spacious  It is more suited to the business traveller rather than leisure  Staff were friendly   the only gripe I had was that there was no separate no smoking section in the restaurant  I have no idea why anyone would class this as a   star  I guess some people are just miserable    I have also stayed at the Madinat Jumeirah   Hatta Fort which were super luxurious  Avari isn t as luxurious but is clean   has all the amenities you would expect from a   star hotel  
N =>  Horrible     This place was horrrible  After a long    hr flight we had to put up with loud arabic music parties that went on  everyday  from    am  amSound proofing is real bad in the hotel The room was ok  small with dirty carpets  stained   Not a very pleasant smelling room   bathroom was decent The buffet breakfast that was complimentary in our hotel package was not the greatest  I found myself eating croissants and watermelon only Due to this inconvenience of our first night we were bumped up to a suite room  which reeked even more  Even leaving the windows open and spraying perfume did not help Staff is kind They call themselves a   star hotel rated my emirates airlines  but I would say a   star Not even worthy of   star  And they charge a rediculous Amount per night    we paid      a night since we booked thru emirates airlines but their charges at the reservations desk per night were      for a standard room   I do not reccomend this hotel  thank god we were only there for   nights and then had reswervations for another   nights at the crowne plaza which is a superior five star hotel  and lives upto it  We loved the crowne plaza  its the best  We would definately go to the crowne on our next visit  We could not get availability for our first   nights in crowne plaza otherwise we wouldve stayed all   nights at the crowne plaza  We also bought our hotel accomodation for the corwne thru emirates airlines  since they offer disc if you fly with them  And it was      per night for a gogeous standard room with compl breakfast incl  and the breakfast was out of this world  It is worth it   The prices of these rooms will probably be cheaper during other seasons since mar may is peak season for them Hope the review helps  Good luck with the hotel search  
N =>   I stayed for a whopping    minutes  I stayed at the Sheraton Deira in Dubai on           over the weekend with my hubby   It was lovely   I had to fly back to Dubai the   th  but this time I went by myself  I just flew in last night   I booked my flight and hotel through Expedia and since it was only going to be a short visit  I didn t bother checking into hotels  I just booked the cheapest one  I figured a  quot hotel quot  with the Le Meridien name attached should be lovely    WRONG  The cab driver from the airport to the hotel  had never heard of the hotel and didn t know where to find it  After driving around for almost an hour in the busy traffic through the city in a not so clean or friendly neighborhood  we finally pulled down a dark dingy alley where we reached the front door of this  quot hotel quot   While the doorman and gentleman at the front desk were very friendly and tried their best to make me feel comfortable    it was impossible to do because I was already upset about driving around trying to locate the place and found there was heavy traffic and construction work being done in the streets right outside  I tried to stay positive but when I got to my room I almost wept because all the furniture was old and run down  The walls had marks and different color stains on them and the kitchen utensils provided in the studio apartment were all used and dirty  The walls were paper thin and I could hear everything that was going on  on in the apartments on my floor  It wasn t until I was resting on the bed  trying to relax when I smelled cigarette smoke being blown into my room through the AC vent from my neighbors room  I picked up the phone to call a different hotel and noticed there was cigarette ashes in the cradle of the telephone receiver  I was completely disgusted  packed up and left immediately  This was definitely a lesson for me to never book the cheapest and to ALWAYS do my research FIRST  
N =>   Cockroaches in room   an awful experience    I booked this hotel based on Expedia rating it as a    property  The building is extremely old and the room I was given had cockroaches in it  Upon discovering these  I was offered another room on a different floor  however I didn t feel that the residence s cleanliness standards were up to scratch in general  This doesn t feel like a Le Meridian property and I was extremely disappointed  After a lot of effort  I was offered to be moved to another apartment block  However the management were unable to get a taxi for   hour and I ended up having to walk to the new place  What if I d needed to get to the airport  The location is pretty horrible   a very old part of Dubai and not recommended for tourists This doesn t even feel like a    establishment   I hope Le Meridien make urgent improvements that are clearly necessary to restore this place to a suitable standard  
N =>   by Le Meridien but not at all Meridien There was no review of this place  so I thought it was new and it said By Le Meridien  so I booked it on Hotel com  I knew it was a two star  but expected that meant no lobby  no pool  etc  But I never expected that Meridien would put its name on a place with such a terrible bathroom and standard of cleanliness  The staff was very nice  location as expected  but    the bathroom was terrible  the shower was a small shower pan  the shower curtain was too high and wider than the shower  hence no way to avoid flooding the entire floor  not up to anything Meridien should put their name on  even if they did put out the nice little soap  etc  No wonder this place isn t on the Meridien web site  The bedspread was new as shown in the photo  but the telephone was old and too dirty to want to put near your face  Avoid this place  you can do better  
N =>   Absolute perfection  The property is absolutely beautiful  we loved all the traditional Arabic accents and decorations as well as the comforting environment in the room  We were able to fully  amp  completely relax while at our villa and at the beach  We were so comfortable and relaxed we didn t even worry about locking our doors while we were out or locking up our cameras while we swam in the ocean  Not having to worry about the little things  made a big difference to our trip  There are so many examples of the Beit Al Bahar and the Jumeriah Beach Hotel staff ensuring we didn t have to worry or think about anything  The only time we really had to think  was when we tried to decide where to eat at the many fantastic Jumeriah International restaurants  The Beit Al Bahar staff was always so kind and helpful and they truly anticipated our needs  sometimes before we even knew what our needs were  One afternoon after a day on the beach  we were in our villa debating going to get a light snack as we didn t have dinner reservations until   pm  Literally  during this discussion  our doorbell rang and the villa staff brought us afternoon tea  This was completely unexpected and was appreciated for many reasons   anticipating our needs  a light snack and most importantly   a traditional experience  When we sadly left Dubai  the item which stood out from our trip the most was the people  Every single person we interacted with was extremely friendly  kind and helpful  We have never been surrounded by such hospitality and such wonderful people  We have stayed at other  The Leading Hotels of the World   while they all live up to a higher standard  the Jumeriah Beach Hotel exceeds this standard  
N =>  Best hotel in Dubai Simply the best place to stay in Dubai  even better than the Burj Al Arab  Everything was perfect from the rose petals in our round sunken bath  to the magnificent view of the Burj Al Arab from our private pool  It s truly a wonderful place to stay   only the Spa Suite at the Banyan Tree Bangkok is better  
N =>   Lovely we had a stopover for   days at this hotel  n trust me it was too good   We had a one bedrrom apartment with a seperate kitchen with washing machine  fridge  microwave  cutlery n many more things   not to mention   lcd tvs in hall and bedroom      bedroom was huge  done up beautifully  soft mattresses n pillows u can sink into The hotel entrance is good  fancy lifts n all Cant think of any negitive points   plz check out photos which i hv posted    
Nice rooms nice pool well meaning staff   but it s Fawlty Towers in the middle of a building site It would be unfair to criticise this hotel to ruthlessly  as it has great potential BUT  and it s a big but  the place is literally wallowing in a dust bowl in the middle of nowhere  apparently in some kind of taxi no mans land  possibly as there s nothing else nearby that would require a cabbie to know the area  The surrounding neighbourhood  and that word suggests far too much of a sense of community  consists of several yet to be filled artificial lakes  numerous unfinished tower blocks  a motorway  which does a great job of blocking one off even further from the more developed neighbourhood opposite  as there s no pedestrian access over it   and not a lot else The hotel plays a nauseating piece of Cafe Del  muzak on continuous loop in the lobby  which had me ready to scream after a couple of days  Just one cheesy song  playing over and over again  Poor staff  They told me that the hotel designer mandated it  cynical b  tard The hotel management succeeded in evacuating part of the hotel by mistake while I was there  when they ran a fire alarm test without   erm   telling the guests that there was a fire alarm test I could go on ranting  but a lot of the other stuff was teething problems for a new hotel  On the bright side  the  overpriced  restaurant was offering good food  and the bar is a bit of a local haunt for ex pats coming in from the desert of unfinished apartments in which they live nearby Give it a couple of years   assuming Dubai isn t closed down for financial incompetence   and this will be a nice  if synthetic  neighbourhood  The soon to open Metro station nearby will help to make it more accessible But for now I d say steer clear of this hotel until they ve improved their own processes  and the surrounding area has been tidied up a little  It s got great potential  but avoid for now  
N => Hotel wonderful especially leisure facility and staff pleasant helpful and could not do enough to make us feel welcome Our first time in Dubai so we did not know what to expect   Hotel and staff wonderful very luxurious room and the pool was a bonus  The only downside we were so far out  Taxis are cheap and available  Time wasted travelling    weeks would be better than   nights   
N => First class rooms and service Hotel rooms well designed with every ammenity  Night view from Bar terrace stunning At moment a taxi is required  due to surrounding construction works  but they are fairly cheap  Catering not yet up to a standard to tempt inhouse dining Staff could not be bettered although room service was a little slow  A bargin if you can get a deal via Lastminute  com   
N =>   Wonderful staff in a comfortable and luxurious building We got a very good deal because it was the  quot soft launch quot   but everything we needed for a comfortable stay was working well  The room was spacious  well fitted  stylish  if you like contemporary marble  glass and wood  and comfortable  Service was unobtrusive but always there when we needed it  even at   am   and the staff were eager to help   even to the extent of helping solve a problem with our car hire company after we d left  which is more than you d get elsewhere  The only meal we wanted was breakfast but it was a good spread with excellent quality and variety and a pretty good price for Dubai     dh        pp   The public spaces are stunning Yes  the neighbourhood is still being developed  it s some way south of the original centre of Dubai in the ina Jumeirah Lakes area  and the taxi drivers haven t all located it yet  but the hotel is clearly destined to be very good indeed  I can only hope we ll be able to afford the prices it ought to be able to command  
N =>   Building Site This is a great hotel       no complaints about     that but we were not warned we would be surrounded by many many new bulidings being erected  It seemed as though we were staying on a building site  in fact most of Dubai is like this now I doubt if we will ever return to the Dubai we once knew  
N =>   Not as expected  should be a  star Stayed here for a week from          to           Checked in ok  The one bedroom apartment is smaller than expected  The deco was very nice  but it seemed that was all it had going for it  It seemed that they built this hotel but didnt test the practically of the admenities  First thing  the TV in the bedroom did not work  Having a shower practically flooded the bathroom  as the bath screen just leeked water all over the floor and the shower head has too much pressure that when it hit your body the water went everywhere mainly the floor  The bathroom sink had insufficient drainage and just blocked while brushing my teeth  Told the front desk and they sent someone to fix the TV  when they did come they said there is a technically fault and it wont be fixed til the following morning  The AC had some fault with it and no matter how high we put the temperature the rooms never got warmer  The bed sheets and pillows had a mildew smell  which housekeeping change the sheets but not the throw pillows or coverlet  so the smell still lingered  Complained to the front desk and requested to be moved  They said they will look into it and let us know  After   hours sitting in a freezing room  we were moved to a room two rooms down  The new room was fine and decided to go out that night  We set the heating up as we both dont like AC and the room too colder to cope with Came back early morning about  am and room was still freezing  Called front desk again and they sent an engineer to investigate  He took about and hour to fix it  after he figured out the thermostat had gone  The next day the room was still cold that we opened the balcony doors to get some warmth in the room from outside  My partner got a chest infection from the cold AC and all we could do was request another duvet from housekeeping  A couple of days later we had a power cut so no electricity in the room for a couple of hours  but they sent someone up to fix it   Therefore all the clocks in the apartment were incorrect  Called three times to the front desk about this and spoke to them directly as well as any staff we passed by  doormen etc and nothing was done about the clocks  The hotel provided one free shuttle bus at   am to either The Dubai Mall  Mall of the Emirates  Jumeirah Beach Residence or IBN Battata Mall  But as our clocks were out of sync  front desk had to keep calling us as the shuttle had to keep waiting for us  They should have provided regular shuttle services  What was funny was the fact that you had to book a seat with the front desk  and when you say you want to book a seat for the shuttle  they reply  what time do you want    Obviously this implies that there is other times available apart from the   am as stated  which I asked what departure times are available  which they then said   am They claim there is free wifi in the hotel but this only applys if you have a laptop as you need to connect it to the TV  so we had to use the one in the lobby  which all other guests seem to do as well We also had problems with the iron in the room  There was some brown liquid in the iron  like stale water  We tried to wash it out but it ruined my partner s white shirt  Again we requested a new iron  spoke to three diffrent people including housekeeping and nothing  Finally complained to management  the supervisor name was Stephanie and as we listed all the issues  she seemed not too concerned with the inconvience we had suffered through  We requested a late check to compensate for the problems we had  she was unwilling to do unless we pay GBP       to check out at  pm We just checked out at   am and left the luggage with the bellboy  got a shuttle to the mall and ccame back later to collect the luggage for our flight at midnight The location is not too bad if themetro nearby was working  as that is the only way you can get across the Sheilk Zeyed Road to the Dubai ina Mall and Jumeirah Beach Residence without having to use a taxi as we had too  Definately would not stay here again  If anyone chooses to stay here  wait til       when the metro is fully running and if most of the construction around the hotel is completed as this adds at least an additional Dhs  to    for the taxi to go around the oneway system to get to the hotel  Also not many taxi drivers know where the Bonnington Towers is or Jumeirah Lake Towers is  so be prepared to take note of the area and the roads to direct them  
Nice rooms good staff   and a GREAT price    ided to choose this hotel following the reviews on tripadvisor and it was pretty much as expected  A brand new hotel with   star finish in soft launch stage  Lovely rooms furnished to a high standard  friendly staff but a few service type glitches  Other plus points   lovely pool and jacuzzi and unlike other reviewers I enjoyed having an area to sit out without being in the sun  Donwside for me was getting a taxi from the hotel  On numerous occaisions we ordered a cab for a specific time only to wait up to    minutes after this time for the cab to arrive  Also location wise there are no restaurants  shops etc within walking distance but Dubai ina is fun and only a shop cab ride away  Overall I would recommend this hotel  and definitely whilst it is at such a good price  but dont expect perfection in  quot soft launch quot    thats why you re getting the discount 
N =>   Rooms excellent but     We stayed at the bonnington for   days in a Deluxe room   Postive Points  Room as exceptional  very funky and luxurious  Staff welcoming every morning  Jaccuzi was excellentNegative Points  Location   the hotel is in the middle of a construction site  don t expect any great views from your room  We had workmen and diggers to look at each day  or from the leisure deck  Location   we spent over      on taxi fares during the week  you cannot walk anywhere so be prepared to pay  Cost to Bur Dubai was approx   dhirams  Jumeriah Beach Park   dr  Taxi drivers not aware of the hotel  I found myself as the local guide telling drivers where to go  this should change as more people stay   Authors lounge took us an hour to get our lunch with no apologies from the waiter staff  they even ran out of english breakfast tea  not acceptable for a   star hotel  Concierge   We tried book a desert safari with concierge  however we were advised the company we wanted to book with charged an extra   dhirams to pick us up from the hotel and he reccomended another company who were much more expensive  This was completely untrue and ringing from our room we booked the safari with no extra costs  Personally I think concierge take a cut from this company  please be aware however all trips end up at the same location for dinner and belly dancing   Pool is not what the pictures make out  however ok for relaxing but nothing specialAs mentioned in other reviews this hotel is undergoing a soft opening  we were not advised on this when booking the rooms  although we got a good deal on the hotel The hotel needs to link up with a beach hotel to offer beach facilities for leisure travellers  this is a must  Using a hotel beach can cost up to     dhirams which is very expensive for   day  
N =>  Great rooms but room for improvement      Stayed here for   nights  The hotel is during it s  soft  opening stage so the rooms were relatively cheap compared to similar hotels in the area  Arrived late to be told that the executive lounge was not yet open  As this was advertised as part of my package i queried this and was told that i would be given use of the mini bar  We went up to the room and it was stunning  A reasonably sized lounge area with desk  a large bedroom immaculately presented with access to a balcony and alarge bathroom with   sinks and a freestanding deep bath  There was alsoa toilet and large walk in shower  First impressions were fantastic I wanted a bath but there was no hot water  It was possible i was the first person to stay in this room and maintenance came and had fixed the problem within    minutes  At the  soft  opening stage you can expect and forgive teething problems  The mini bar was empty so had to get a drink delivered to the room  In the morning i asked for the mini bar to be stocked due to the executive lounge not being open and was told that mini bars were not yet in use but could be used as a fridge  I was told i could have free muffins and fruit juices in the restaurant throughout the day instead  I asked if there would be some use of the bar included in lieu of the lounge but this was not agreed The buffet breakfast was of a poor standard when compared to e g the Hilton Jumeirah  The complimentary water in the room was never replenished nor were the tea and coffee facilities stocked  Another annoyance was after going to bed for a few hours in the afternoon for a sleep  we placed the  do not disturb  light on    an hour later we were rung to ask when the cleaner s could get in     do not disturb should mean exactly that In summary the hotel is of a very high standard visually and the bar is very cool and the decor of a very high standard  On completion i m sure the hotel will be fantastic  The staff were very friendly although still obviously coming to terms with their roles  Would i pay the full price upon completion  Probably not i think there are better hotels in the area but if you have the budget it would be worth giving it a try as im sure in time it will be a great stay  Finally on checking in they take a credit card as security  On checking out and paying with my debit card i was told thay had taken the full amount off my credit card and it would be refunded in    days which i was not happy about so check when you check in  
Nice room awful location The quality of the rooms are the only plus point here  the staff all try hard to please and are very pleasant  The pool area is miserable  much smaller than it appears in the photos and looks out onto a huge dusty building site  there is nowhere to walk to and the only access to the Bonnington is by car or taxi but beware the signs are virtually non existent and on the four occasions I took a taxi it got lost every time  There are no road names so you have to rely on asking directions from one of the hundreds of construction workers in the area  If you are unfortunate enough to end up there your only hope is to take a taxi to one of the nearby beach hotels for the day but this comes at a high price as the beach hotels i e  Meridien charge     AED per head per day plus the cost of your taxi  We booked in for   nights  my wife left for home after   and I stayed for   as I was visiting the Abu Dhabi F  GP  We were both very disappointed with the set up and very please to leave  The hotel manager is a very pleasant fellow but has also had enough and is leaving or has now left so that should give you some idea of the situation  In my opinion they would have been better to not open the hotel until much more of the development is complete  Finally they have some major problem with internet access and were unable in   days to sort it out  and dont rely on a good breakfast  the buffet is awful  
N =>  Comfortable   bedroom with quality finish We have just spent   days at The Bonnington in a   bedroom apartment  The apartments are very well finished with ample sleeping and bathroom facilities  The area is far from finished but never the less this did not spoil our break  The main problem I found was that when coming back from a night out a lot of the taxi companies did not know the location of the tower and we got lost several times at the beginning Just bring the map located on your hotel access card  We had breakfast once and a snack at night which was fine  Also taxi seem to charge more for picking up from Bonnington  Alcohol is expensive in Dubai so my tip is to visit Duty Free at the airport to stock up  Staff at the hotel were very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate  The pool area is lovely but there aren t that many sun loungers so we went to the beach most days Having a washing machine etc was ideal as we could do laundry during our trip  great when you have a child  All in all a good hotel  although not quite on the beach not far away  
N =>  Its got to be a   star Hotel    This was our first trip to Dubai and we were not to sure what to expect as we had been given mixed reviews about the quality of some of the hotels  however we were really amazed at Bonnington Towers  It was not just the designer look and the quality of the rooms  the fluffy towels  the lovely toiletries and the gorgeous rain shower  but the staff seem to take a real pride in the place too One of the guys at the lesuire deck saw us arrive and gave us a full tour  explaining that you can even play your own DVD when your in the sauna   There was a steam room too but in the heat of the summer we didnt use it  The gym was alll brand new with power plates  which my gym back home charges for    and the pool water was chilled which was really refreshing and there was also a hot tub which was great too with amazing views from the pool There is still work going on around the area but we never really noticed it and location wise it was great for the beach  the shopping malls and the restaurants for the evening   would recommend the Buda Bar at Grosvenor Hotel   lovely place  great vibe and fab food with top service I cant wait to go back here   it was so much better than we ever thought and I would not stay anywhere else  The Hotel also told us that the new metro line will run right next to the hotel when it opens on the  th of tember so that will be even better when we go next time  but taxis were cheap  about    to the Buda Bar     to the mall  so we had no bother So jealous of anyone else going  you will have a fantastic time   enjoy     
N =>   A great place to break the journey to Australia We feel we are too old to travel straight through from Europe to Australia so  flying Emirates  we wanted somewhere nice to spend the last night of our holiday  but we find the hotel prices in Dubai a bit scary or the reviews of cheaper places too daunting  So we got a really good deal on Expedia for this hotel          AUD for two nights We got a beautiful suite with full kitchen facilities  a washer and freezer as well as a fridge  and complimentary coffee making facilities  Great bathroom and a really comfy king sized bed  Probably one of the nicest modern hotels we have stayed at  though modern is not usually our style  It adjoins the Burjuman Mall which is full of the ritziest shops imaginable and has some nice cafes  A cab to the gold souk cost about   dhs Breakfast was magnificent  Just about anything you could want and  if that s possible  too many people serving you Disadvantages  A quite hefty fee for internet use  so we didn t bother  I gather it is free wifi in the mall next door Their restaurant is not licenced We wanted a nice Italian or French restaurant nearby  in a hotel so we could have some wine with our meal  The young concierge was good at ringing local hotels to see what they had  but he really did not know of anything local except a nearby bar  I feel he could have at least had a list of the hotels from their local magazine  or suggested one of their own restaurants at another Rotana hotel where we could have gone via taxi  We ended up at the nearby hotel bar where we had a decent steak and poor wine quite cheaply  but it was not looking like a place to be late at night  
N =>   When are we going back  My family    adults  amp    Kids  stopped in Dubai on our way to Malta  to break up the trip I m so glad we stayed for   nights  When we go back  we will stay for much longer The Hotel we stayed in was fantastic  We stayed on the   nd floor of the Hotel  The room was serviced daily  The room was spacious  Upon booking I advised there would be   kids travelling  however upon arrival  we had to call for an extra bed  House keeping brought it up straight away  The Hotel is joined with the beautiful Burjuman Shopping Centre  We had everything within an easy walking distance  amp  in airconditioning  The heat  amp    children were always a concern  but staying at this Hotel was the best thing we did  The pools are very safe  with life guards on duty throughout the entire day  Pools are very clean  amp  pool towels are provided poolside  An American breakfast was included in the cost of our booking  amp  we enjoyed every bit of it  The conceirge were ontop of their game  Whenever we need a taxi  or know something in particular  they always had one ready  I can t wait to return  This Hotel was called Burjuman Rotana Suites when we stayed  now it s called Burjuman Arjaan  
N =>   What a shame  Horrible management of a nice hotel We stayed in Burjuman Rotana Suites between        ember       I must say that the management of hotel booking was horrible  I booked around   months in advance  and confirmed my booking both via email and through a representative in person the week before our arrival  Nonetheless when we came to check in we were informed that they have cancelled our booking  We were shocked to hear such news and were asked to wait for a while  After more than half an hour we were told that they will reallocate us to a different hotel with the same facilities and room specification  The staff member who was handling our situation was mainly concerned about payment even before we were allocated to the new hotel  he was unprofessional as he tried to rush us into payment and didn t even apologize for their mistake  We were rushed into a cab with our luggage  even though we had insisted that we will not consent the move to the other hotel before we view the room  To top things up  the receptionist was arguing with the cab driver regarding the fee while we were in the car  it was unbelievably unprofessional of him to argue about   AED  Our booking was made for a junior suite and the room they reallocated to us was a standard room in a hotel located in a cut off area  the reason I booked at Burjuman was size of the suite and convenient location which is near the conference I was attending and its attachment to the Burjuman mall  When we refused to take the room they had offered and threaten to complain the receptions finally connected us to the manger  even though we had asked to speak to them since initial check in  We were informed that we would be given a junior suite at Burjuman on someone else s expense  this was repeated several times We were really disappointed with the treatment we received  as it took around   hours to allocate a room for us and no one even apologized and nothing was done to compensate for the ill treatment we received  
N =>  Hotel excellent Dubai expensive and rude  Ok we arrived at the hotel very early   am  I had fore warned them that we were arriving early and they had told me that they maybe able to have a room ready for us at  am but could not guarantee it  but no note was made and we were told that we would have to wait untill  pm for a room  I asked what we could do in the meantime  she told me everything was closed and carried on with her work  I asked again  look we just want something to occupy our time  she said we could use the gym if we wanted to  after a   hour flight we didnt want to do that but we thought we would at least have a look around to fill the time  fortunatly we found a quietish corner in the gym area with a coffee machine and some sofas to sit in while we waited for Dubai to wake  I checked with the reception again at  am and they were going to have a room ready for   am  thank god  So we went around and looked at the closed shops for an hour  Checked into the suite  very impressive  very big  with balcony all pretty clean and with all the extras you could ever need  washing machine  dishwasher  tumble drier  Internet access was not free and was pretty expensive  almost rip off prices  The balcony area was covered in black dust  So mixed impressions After a few days in Dubai we were pretty disapointed  its boring  the shopping was expensive with no real bargains to be had  I was expecting a shopping mecca  but was utterly disapointed  alot of the designer clothes were MORE expensive than in the UK  There is nothing to see  its all dessert  We were there for   days  done a balloon trip  highly recomended  and the wild wadi water park  much fun  but becuase the shopping was expensive it removed most of the apeal of dubai  I am also afraid to say that after being in Thailand  the land of a      smiles  Dubai was more like the land of a      grimaces  It seems like the tourist industry had been geared towards extracting as much money as possible from its tourists  For example  when we left the hotel they asked us if we wanted a taxi to the airport  yes I said  ok that will be     dirams  about       I said no a standard Dubai taxi will be fine  I see he said  well it will take a long time to get here because of the traffic  I said that will be fine  Disgruntled he phoned me a taxi  it arrived it    mins and cost    dirhams to get to the airport As for Dubai  next time I will look for a direct flight or wont bother leaving the airport  As for the hotel  ok location  massive rooms  full room facilities  cheapish for the standard of room       a night  But poor room service  Its more of a room to rent than a personel service hotel  
N =>  Great roomsshame about the pools ROOMS  I stayed in the Classic Suite  a one bedroom suite which is the basic room category  I was REALLY impressed with the room  modern and new furniture  great bathroom  flat screen TVs in the lounge room and bedroom  Some of the Classic Suites have a balcony  I started out in one with a balcony  but it was right next to a public gym where they were renovating  This meant that the room was really noisy  so I requested a move  The next suite was much smaller without a balcony  but still really nice  The rooms were a little noisy  you could hear noise from the corridor and from the room next door  but it was not too bad POOLS  I was really unimpressed by the pools  You have to go through the public gym to get to them  there are   pools  one is waist deep and can be seen from the gym  You have to walk down   flights of stairs to get to it  Then there is a   m pool  but you also have to walk through the gym to get to it  and walk UP   flightsof stairs  Neither pool is private  and I felt far too uncomfortable  having the entire public gym being able to see me  to stay around the pool for too long LOCATION  Excellent location right above Burjuman Shopping Centre  Taxis are readily available at the front of the hotel SERVICE  The service was excellent  however I was overcharged upon leaving  and did not realise until later Hopefully they will refund my money    DUBAI  I was in Dubai last year and the shopping was great  Prices have increased substantially since then  however  which greatly impacted my stay  I hardly shopped at all  Even food is much more expensive  I really don t think I iwll go back to Dubai for holidays again  to be honest  
N =>   Lovely modern hotel with beautiful comfortable suites  We didn t know what to expect when we booked this hotel     we based it solely on the name Rotana  since we had heard it was a good chain  We were so relieved to arrive and find a lovely  modern  new hotel  Our room was a spotless mini suite  with a large living dining area  beautiful bathroom and spacious bedroom  bed was very comfy  felt like we were home   Breakfast was delivered to us every morning by room service  and no shortage of food  I didn t mind the location     seems no matter where you stay in Dubai  you have to take a taxi to get around  so it worked out well for us  My only minor complaint is the staff seemed a bit unsure of city attraction information  but we managed nevertheless  I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there during our next visit to Dubai  
N =>   Where are the   Stars  My son  his girlfriend and I were there a few hours ago for Chinese tea  I am quoting her in the title  She wondered at some point in the middle of whole affair what had happened with the seven star service The tea was more or less OK  but the food was terrible  I have eaten dim sum both in the USA and also in Beijing  so I know what to expect  The food that they served us tasted like something you had cooked a week ago  pulled it out of the refrigerator and warmed it up in the microwave for no more than   seconds  Ah   and the cook had no idea how to cook Chinese food To make matters worse  I was not allowed to use my video camera due to  quot privacy concerns  quot  In case you are wondering  we payed the equivalent to     dollars each for this affair I wouldn t recommend it to anybody  Do something else while in Dubai and save your money  
N =>   We had a great time  This is a very friendly hotel and nothing is too much trouble  the staff were fantastic and especially in the Aussie bar lol The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was nearly as big again The swimming pool was brilliant and it was like getting in the bath The lifeguard was continually cleaning and moving the sun beds back when they had been moved Breakfast was also good  with a variety of choice Could not fault this hotel  even though we have not scored it high for location  we had a car to get around  which was fun but you got used to it very quickly  
N =>   Extraordinary experience I did not think any hotel could exceed the expectations of my imagination  however this resort did  It certainly is not inexpensive  but worth every penny  Along with the break taking state of the art facilities the service is second to none  Our suite was two stories and over      sq feet  it was exquisitely appointed and had every luxury  Once in the room  the entire suite can be controlled by in wall touch pads or handheld touch screens  this included curtains  opening the front door  lighting  sound  calling the butler  security security cameras  etc  The fitness center and indoor pool area was also a treat  After a long massage I hit the cedar sauna and the menthol infused steam room   I was so relaxed I could barely make it to the room  Later that evening we took advantage of the indoor infinity pool  beautiful    One thing that really caught us off guard was the fact that no matter what area we visited in the facility they addressed us by name  It is still a mystery to us as to how they accomplished that  whether by technology or memorization we were still impressed and amazed The food in the hotel was very good  but not quite as impressive as the hotel facilities and service  If you truly want to be pampered and amazed I recommend going  We are looking forward to our next visit  after we save up some money  Ha   
N =>   Not worth the money  a disaster  We booked to experience the culinary flight whilst staying in Dubai  What a nightmare  The experience took   hours and was only memorable in that I have never spent so much money on such poor food with deplorable service and extraordinary long waits between courses  An experience never to repeat      
N =>  High Tea at the Sky View Bar I travelled to Dubai earlier this year and on the top of my to do list was High Tea at the Burj Al Arab Sky View Bar  This had been made out to be one of the  quot must do s quot  on your visit to Dubai  The experience on arrival at the hotel was amazing  The hotel structure was better than it was ever made out to be  The lift ride to the top was amazing  To view spectacular  for what we could see  as it was slightly overcast On arrival at the Sky view bar we were shown to our table where we were offered champagne to kick off our experience  That was the best part of our afternoon as from there it was down hill  The food served looked un appealing and as though it had been dumped on the plate  The cakes were relatively tasteless and could even have been slightly stale  All this for hefty price tag  Sadly the food was the least impressive of all the other hotels I dined in  including Raffles and the Inter continental at Festival City  I would not reccomend this experience to anyone as I think that there is far better value at other hotels  with significantly better quality  
N =>  Great experience but be prepared to spend To be clear  I did not stay overnight at the Burj Al Arab  but enjoyed a  quot day trip quot  package which included access to the private beach  access to the pool  a massage at the spa  and apetizers with drinks at sui  the hotel s Asian inspired restaurant lounge  This cost about      for two people The pool was amazing  It has a magnificent view of the city  The massage was short  but very nice  It left my skin feeling smooth and silky I don t have anything to complain about  except maybe the fact that although our phone confirmation through the concierge at our hotel  JW riott  said we would be able to go to the hotel starting at   in the morning  when the faxed confirmation was received it listed the time as    am The staff was very courteous and not snobby at all  despite the fact they knew we weren t regular guests Oh  And the food you can order by the pool was outrageously expensive  Most expensive slice of pizza I ve ever had  
N =>   A once in a lifetime experience We went to Dubai specifically to stay in this hotel  We were there to celebrate our   th wedding anniversary  From the moment we entered  we were made to feel like an honored guest  we were seated in the lobby  and given dates and coffee while the checkin process took place  We were escorted to our room  and a butler unpacked my wife s bags  Every time we left the suite  we were greeted by friendly staff  Every time we returned  we were greeted by friendly staff  No wish would have been too much for them  The suite itself was spacious and comfortable  The bathroom was decadent  complete with immense shower  and jacuzzi tub  It was a fabulous place to stay for   nights  Is it worth       night  No  but no place in the world is truly worth that expense  Is it   star quality service  Absolutely  We have absolutely no complaints whatsoever about the service  it was top notch in every way  Even though the expense is off the chart  I would have no qualms about returning and staying there again some day  It was a tremendous experience  
N =>   Burj Al Arab is unbelievable    The most luxorious hotel I ve ever stayed in  It was truly amazing  Unfortunately technology only goes so far  For example  our  quot does everything but make your coffee quot  remote control lost battery power because we left it on the table and not back on the charger  So no one could enter until we figured out how to turn off the  quot Do Not Disturb quot  lock manually  no easy feat    Also  the highly touted butler service was inconsistent  The butler on arrival offered to unpack our bags  iron our clothes and make our coffee in the morning  But the morning butler refused to iron citing  quot company policy quot  and couldn t operate the in room coffee machine  So we stood in a decadent two story       a night suite ironing our own clothes  while our friends  butler did it all for them  Overall good service but could be better  The hotel itself  Breathtaking  At least once in a lifetime thing to do    
N =>   Unbelievable luxury   and that underwater restaurant   wow This place get s    stars  not     My brother and I ate at the underwater Al Mahara restaurant and then went all the way to the top of the building to chill out and have drinks in the  quot Sky Bar quot   Al Muntatha  The Al Mahara was one of the most   no  THE most amazing food experience I have ever had  We ate the Seafood Platter  don t ask the cost of all of this stuff   let s just say that in order to make a reservation for this restaurant  you have to block out     USD on a credit card just to get in the door and ensure you have a table  and the selection of sea creatures was enough to make Neptune salivate  GET the Crab Cakes appetizer   it is  hands down  the most succulent thing you will ever ingest in your life   in short  spend the money if you can   worth every cent  pound sterling  Benjamin Franklin  Euro or Ruble     
N =>  A beautiful stay    highly recommended Our   night stay was just perfect  As others have stated the rooms are amazing  amenities first class and service for us was as desired   i e  not too over the top The breakfast was though only average in our opinion with a limited selection  The pool is small but the private beach lovely If you re heading to Dubai a night or two night stay is a must  simply to wake up with a mirror on the ceiling is an experience in itself  Remember though Gents need a jacket to dine in many of the restaurants  
N =>   Second time just as good as the first  This was our second weekend at the Burj   the last was in       I was very happy to find that the hotel had lost none of the wow factor of our first stay  The service was top class and the  quot rooms quot   if you can call these house sized spaces rooms  are simply outstanding  We arrived at  am and our suite was ready and we requested a late   pm  check out which was no problem  Breakfast and taxes were included in our rate which made the final bill slightly less painful  Expensive  yes but worth it  Definitely   
N =>  Jaw Dropping  Well what can I say     AMAZING ROOM  AMAZING SERVICE Just chilling by the poolside bar was lovely  dont forget to visit wild wadi water ark and book the Hummer desert trip its CRRRAAAZYYYY The only slight problem was that the virtual submarine ride was broken to the fish restaurant and we were not that impressed with the food However the Al Iwan was the best food I have EVER eaten   Thank you to the hotel staffp s  ITS DAMN EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY  
N =>  Not seven but clos to six stars Room is spacious and elegant  Carpet had a rather large dirty patch close to the chaiselongue  No large twin beds in the panorama suite but just a rather soft king size bed  Why don t you offer two queen beds  One mattress is good for part time  Not all your married clients like to sleep on the same mattress full time  It would be difficult if I would travel with a son or a sister  Butler service is not that good  Used glasses and food leftovers are not removed when clients left their rooms  Flight reconfirmation could not be delegated to the butler  Room service was asked for when we left for breakfast  It came only at lunch time when we were in the room  This is not acceptable Food is very good but not outstanding  e g  comparable to three Michelin star kitchens as they are available in Atlantis Hotel for example  Culinary flight is a good offer   the wakyu dish at Al Mahara was excellent  The seafood menu at Al Mahara was very good  too Internet access was not possible twice  The first time I had to wait several hours for repair  There was no radio in the room with classical music  for example  MTV in TV is certainly not our choice Everything was more or less excellent  i e  close to six star      
N =>   Seafood and An Aquarium   there are better options We stopped at Dubai for a few nights on the way back from a superb stay in Baros  Maldives  As we only had a few nights we prioritised and decided to treat ourselves to a meal  under the sea we thought  at the Al Mahara at the Burj Upon arrival by standard cab we were greeted perfectly  we wandered inside and were inpressed by the waterfall but especially the fish tanks either side of the escalators  we were slightly early so we went up the escalators  look up as you do so   amazing  and were puzzled to see so many mainly Asian people taking photos in front of a very average water feature  Im still puzzled now after asking one couple why it was so special to them    We decided to have a drink and   of us had soft drinks and nibbles  free  for     which I thought was quite good  in context   service was pefect and the nibble waitress was nice and chatty  We then asked if the obs deck was available to us but sadly it was not   pity Ok time for lunch  and I was anticipating a stupendous environment after the tanks in reception      You check in and go down in the lift to a  empty and dark  lounge we were greeted perfectly and taken to a table on the other side of the fish tanks   note if you want to sit next to the tanks its tables of   only  we were    The place was     full if that and when the menu arrived I knew why  its not cheap even when you have mentally agreed with yourself its      a head without wine its still a shock to see the prices written down A reminder that money is relative was when a family of   came in with   babies and ordered from the main menu for all of them  one of the babies cryed most of the time whilst a woman in the group spent a lot of the time chatting loudly to her mobile phone  Would that be allowed in a top UK restaurant  I will not prattle on rather I will be straight to the point   its not worth it   the environment   tanks were not that big and as we saw the same  big  fish swimming around every    seconds or so it got repetitive Food was good but is good ok   every course looked superb  was very small and tasted  quot good quot  not memorable just ok  One part of the meal was truly superb though and they were the       petit fours that we noticed other diners had but were not offered to ourselves  they are worth asking for   well done pastry chef So  average scenario  let down fish tanks  ok service  the bread waiter was tardy and the drinks waiter forgetfull    good food and stupendous price tag My advice is go the the Dubai Mall  check the fish tank and eat at the rainforest cafe for     of the priceAs a finisher we went to the Burj Boutique  still makes me chuckle  if you want a  cm high glass Burj with three colour flashing lights or a illuminated picture on a roller of the hotel and birds you will be in tat heaven  but the sight of a young lady haggling with the guy in the tat shop over a   cm high shiny Burj made my day  
N =>  Loved the Beach view This is a Awsome Hotel  When I visited there as on Business visa  I was alone there in my room  But when i stayed there i seen many couples was enjoying alot  amp  i thought at that time this is a good hotel to spend Time with our Wife     So i will sugest you that if you are planning to visit Dubai   Stay in this hotel only what a restuarent  amp  Beach View  Hotel Facilities  amp  Infrasturcture there all are awsome     JetPrivilege membership            
N =>   The Wonderful Burj Al Arab  To celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary in Dubai we decided to spend our first two nights at the Burj Al Arab  On recent visits to Dubai we have always stayed at the Al Qasr which has been one of our most favourite hotels  so as this was a special occasion we decided to book the Burj Well all I can say is  we had the best holiday we have ever had and the Burj made our Anniversary absolutely wonderful and so special We arranged a Rolls Royce to pick us up and this started our holiday in style  we were treated like Royalty from start to finish When we arrived we were greeted with cold towels and dates and taken to our Suite  it was fantastic  we could not believe it The whole hotel is amazing and the staff can not do enough for you There were many treats throughout out stay and this just made the whole experience out of this world Our Anniversary Cake and Flowers were just gorgeous and brought tears to my eyes There were a few things I would have changed  but I am not even going to mention them as the highs well exceeded any little niggles My husband summed it up completely when he said  there is a serenity about the Burj  and this was exactly right Burj Al Arab thank you so much for everything  we will definitely be back please keep our room warm for us   
N =>   Disappointed very disappointed  The hotel itself is a magnificent spectacle and the staff are generally very helpful  My wife and I ate at the Al Mahara restaurant  It boasts  quot  Simply the finest seafood in the world quot   If the restaurant was in the UK it would be prosecuted under the Trade Descriptions Act  The food was certainly not fine  of the four course we had between us we complained about    we decided to not have a dessert  we thought that might be tempting fate just a little to far  For starters my wife had the lobster bisque  it looked great  served with two prawn dim sum on the bottom of the plate and the bisque poured over them at the table  The bisque tasted fine however she did find quite a bit of prawn shell in the dim sum  not really what you expect from the finest seafood restaurant in the world  We did mention to our waiter that we did not expect this kind of oversight in the Al Mahara  he said he would mention it to the chef  That was it  then nothing  I started with the Japanese scallops  renowned for there delicate flavour  It was served with a Wagyu beef ravioli and a sauce with completely swamped the complete dish  and the Wagyu beef renowned for its flavour and tenderness was so tough i had to take it out of my mouth  it was inedible  I mentioned this to the waiter and he again said he would mention it to the chef  then nothing  By now I think the chef was packing and going home ashamed without facing his critics  Now the main courses arrived and my dish was reasonable cooked  not great mind you only reasonable  I had the Cod  slightly overcooked and again the delicate flavour of the Cod completely and utterly swamped by the overpowering sauce  again I mentioned this to the waiter  who by this point seemed to be past caring  My lovely wife  I was told to write that  had the Sea Bass  which was cooked to perfection  unfortunately the squid rings that were served with it were absolutely and completely overcooked  the picture of chew a bag of elastic bands does come to mind  Again we complained to the waiter who this time asked us to complete a card to rate the restaurant and write down our comments on the food  we duly did so expecting  more in hope than expectation to have some kind of dialogue with the manager or some other representative regarding our meal  alas no  They did ask on the card where we were staying in Dubai  I thought that maybe we would get a call or something  again alas no  I was also asked for my email address at home  so maybe there would be a message when I got home  alas no  So would I go back to or suggest that my friends visit a restaurant that has just charged me      for the meal I just experienced  no I do not think so  I value my friends The meal as you have no doubt gathered was a disappointment  but the non existent level of customer care is appalling considering they call themselves  quot simply the finest seafood in the world quot  
N =>   Don t waste your money on high tea We decided to treat ourselves to afternoon tea in the  quot best hotel on the world quot   What a let down We arrived in an ordinary taxi and were courteously greeted  We went upstairs to the lobby where were quickly and efficiently shown to our table  We then settled back to enjoy our high tea  served by a succession of different waiters  each of whom seemed to specialize in different parts of the meal  The champagne was fine  as it should be at its quoted price of     per glass  Then orders were taken for tea  which arrived quickly  my tea was absolutely wonderful  Now on to the food  a variety of sandwiches arrived  all nicely presented but nothing extra ordinary  But now something extra ordinary happened  As we were munching our way through the sandwiches  the Beef Wellington man arrived  pushed our sandwich plates to one side and placed the small slices of Beef Wellington in front of us  We felt under unwelcome pressure to eat up and get out  However  after this frantic start  the service calmed down  becoming rather too slack  in fact  My wife wandered off during a slack period and missed the arrival of the cakes  I asked the waitress to come back when my wife had returned  She did not do so  Another cake lady arrived  bearing a different selection of cakes  so my wife happily gorged on them  however  this was rather poor Our teapots were by now cold and we wanted to refresh them  We n ow engaged in the game of  quot catch the waiter s attention quot   Now  it should be pointed out that there was no shortage of waiters  elegent aand attractive young men and women from all parts of Asia  However  noe of them seemed to be prepared to help us  be they had only specific jobs  Take type A cakes round tables at       Greet arriving guests and show them to their tables  Demonstrate how to pour tea  At any rate  it took us far too long to catch someone s attention and get our new pots of tea  which did then arrive pretty promptly What about the quality of the food  Sandwiches  nothing special  Cakes  well I live in Luxembourg and can think of at least three cake shops that would put these cakes to shame   though to be fair they would not stick a small piece of gold leaf on top of the cakes  Tea  glorious  Champagne  good  Service  well below the standard you have the right to expect  After the tea  we wandered through the lobby  past the shops selling gaudy knick knacks to the super rich  The fountains were super  the aquaria on either side of the staircase awe inspiring  the lift to the restaurant very fast and stiflingly hot because its air conditioning was not working  Overall impression  Give this a miss  
N =>   Not all that ist cracked out to be   Its an amazing hotel  no doubt about it  but it came short of my expectations  probably beacause og the hype around it  However  very clean  roomy  pleasant suites  private  quiet and nice athmosphere  Excellent food  Spa was also good    Staff was always doing their best to please guest A very nice  but  too  expensive experience PS  bring sunglasses  cause all that gold will blind you  
N =>  Disappointing We were advised that tea at the Burj Al Arab was a must and was worth the US      that you will pay for two persons We arrived in a regular taxi and was ignored and had to make our up to the venue serving tea  Reception at tea was good and was given a choice of tables with a excellent view of the beach Food was served efficiently with not much time between the   courses where you could savor each course  The quality of food was average   sandwiches were ordinary  scones were dry  beef wellington was good but serving was very small  we expected much more Service was somewhat contrived where some of the waiters were forcing themselves to be pleasant  Some of the uniforms were ill fitting  however  the female waitresses were dressed quite well The venue for tea was an open foyer where tea was frequently disrupted by tours to the hotel  Visitors were walking around the table and blocking the view of the beach    this just destroyed the ambiance and annoying    you had limited privacy We definitely did not receive value for money and service was just ordinary  We had tea in Europe  North America and Asia and tea at Burj el Arab did not compare favourably to other hotels where we had tea  be this was just a bad day for the hotel  
N =>   Our second time around We like be treated like a King and Queen Okay Okay we are neither a King or a Queen but for one night and a high limit credit card we were  We stayed here back in      and enjoyed the place so much we thought we would splurge again SO       later we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite  Again you are just in awe of the place driving up to it and finding a local taxi driver to do it is easy as they don t get many chances to go there  We were on the   th floor this time and were greeted by concierge by name and remembering what we liked last time  We spent the night at the races and returned to our beautiful hotel and had dinner at the buffet in th lobby Didn t think that was worth the      price tag  Breakfast out back the next morning was only     and had filet on the buffet  Had a Corona up in the bar      You are not getting away cheap here  We thought the room was showing some age this time as there was a wear spot on the des chair and all of the shower head sprayers were not working  Piddly stuff but again it s       a night  Hard to sleep here when there is so much to check out and being of humble living back home we were like kids in a candy shop  We were not excited about the mirror over the bed but later found out that you can have it covered There was not a diet Pepsi in the hotel but was assured that our next stay there will be some Fun place to stay but very expensive Lots of memories  The Burg is Dubia  
N =>   Treated like Royalty from check in to check out I had the pleasure of staying here in tember       It was an amazing experience  Expensive but worth every penny  The room was an absoluting beautiful  It was      sq ft with two floors and spiral stair case  His and hers sinks in the bathroom  A jacuzzi for two  Steam shower  The view of the Sea was stunning     hour butler who tidied up the minute u left the room  They gave u full size Hermes fragrances  shampoos  body lotion  aftershave    etc  Lots of other free toiletries to take home like La Prairie s Caviar cream  There is a business center with laptop  fax and printer in each room  Nice swimming pool but who needs that when there is a private beach I thought the food at the restaurants wasn t the best  It wasn t bad but I just expected better tasting food considering everything else about this hotel was top notch I definately recommend this hotel to everyone  I know its expensive and not everyone can afford to stay here  Its totally worth saving for to have a once in a lifetime experience  
N =>   To stay or not to stay    We d bought our flights months ago for a long weekend in Dubai  but a couple of weeks before we were due to fly and we still hadn t booked our accommodation  The reason  The Burj Al Arab  With enough money to consider the idea of staying there  but not so much that we are able to squander it without much thought  we were in a dilemma  Could we really justify spending That  Much  Money We decided to spend one night in the Burj and two nights nearer the center of Dubai  separate review  And to summarise before the details   the Burj was more amazing that I had imagined  It absolutely made our holiday and I m now trying to work out when I can save up enough money to justify going back  for longer  As the Burj Al Arab is quite away out of the center of Dubai we decided to only spend one night there as we didn t want to waste a lot of the weekend travelling in and out of town   this was our first visit to Dubai and we wanted to see as much as possible  Landing in Dubai early in the morning we d pre arranged an airport to hotel transfer with BA to minimise any hassle  We got to the Burj around   am  We were greeted as we walked into the foyer and were sat down while they took our details and passports  Someone brought us cold wet faceclothes  blissful given the heat coming in through the window   some coffee  served in a mini cup but I think with as many top ups as you d like   and a plate of dates  They kind of stood over us though while we sipped our coffee and tasted the dates which felt a little bit awkward  Although knowing us  they d probably asked us something and were looking at us expectantly but we hadn t heard  You can t see much of the hotel from these first few metres of the entrance foyer and what you can see is a bit disappointing  Dull gold  dull red and a bit worn That changes as soon as you step onto the escalators to go up into the main foyer  You can see all the way up the hotel  to all the different floors  as the inside of the Burj is hollow  I hadn t realised  It s light  and airy  and really colourful We were really lucky as a room was available for us straight away  They took us up to our room    th floor but as each room is two floors high it s further up than it sounds  to do the check in   although in hindsight they probably realised their mistake in doing that as they struggled to get our attention back as soon as they opened the door  We d gone for the panoramic suite and were greeted with two storey high floor to ceiling windows and a blue and gold staircase sweeping up to the right  We figure the suite was about     times the size of our two bedroom flat  The pictures on the website don t do it justice and I just don t have the vocabulary or writing skill to help out much  The word that comes to mind is opulent  and all the others associated with it in a thesaurus  I d heard that the Burj is actually a    hotel and the    rating is just clever marketing  I don t know if this is true  but if it is  after seeing this hotel  I think the       star rating system needs to be changed as this hotel is way above any    I ve ever stayed in There are stickers on the windows to let you know that any window cleaners that might pass can not see into the room  Although I m not sure how true that is if the lights are on  As you will have read in other reviews  there are lots of complementary goodies in the room  Obviously we d paid for them in the rate  but there was more than I d even expected  His and hers shower gel  his and hers shampoos  his and hers deodorants  his and hers scent  And when I say  his and hers  I don t mean one shared bottle with a smell to suit male and female  I mean one bottle for him and one bottle for her  Full size  Hermes  Slippers  Flip flops  Beach Bag  box of stuffed dates  the most gorgeous dates I ve ever tasted   and even a bottle of wine Be careful that you don t help yourself to the non free items though   prices for those are in the mini bar menu  We found the pillows  I guess they re not expecting people to go to bed at   am but we were still tired from the flight  and had a nap for an hour before heading out to the Wild Wadi waterpark  a few minutes walk from the hotel and free to guests  You get free towels from the park as a guest of the hotel but you have to pay for a locker      per locker  I m glad we went to the park  but it wasn t really that great and I would have been gutted if we d paid extra to go in  The slow moving river  where you sit on or cling to a rubber ring and float around is a bit boring  The fast chutes  where you sit on a rubber ring and are pushed around by water jets are actually a bit painfull on your rear  The wave pool is ok I suppose and there are sun loungers around it but not worth visiting the waterpark just for that when the beach is not far away  And I expect that the newer waterparks in Dubai have improved upon it We headed back to the Burj to use the gym  about   of each cardio machine  free weights and various weights machines  and the spa pools  female only pools in the ladies changing rooms  and combined male   female pools near the mens changing rooms   Windows overlooking the water  the pools and the gym  not the changing rooms   Very  Nice  Indeed As we d messed up our eating clocks on the flight we weren t hungry for lunch but would be too hungry if we waited for dinner  so we decided to have afternoon tea instead  We ordered it to our room so that we could loaf around in our dressing gowns to eat  It was huge  Mini buns  finger sandwiches  cakes and scones  I think there might have been   scones  It was delicious but we couldn t finish it  When we gathered the willpower to move again we got dressed and went up to the skybar for a couple of drinks  It s a nice bar  but it s nothing really to rave about  The drinks are quite expensive  though that wasn t really a surprise  and it was fine for a few glasses We had a choice of two restaurants for breakfast  included in our rates    we chose the one on the ground floor with lovely views of the outdoor pool  There was so much choice  If you get the chance  try the honeycomb I guess if you have to choose between one night in the Burj Al Arab  or a luxury all inclusive week somewhere else  then you re probably better off going with the other option  But if this is something you want to experience  and you don t mind spending that much money  and you want never to look at another hotel in the same way again  and you want to spend the next age rejigging your budget so that you can go back  then what are you waiting for  Go and book it  
N =>   Worth the    Yes  it s a lot of money  However  it s one of those things that you just have to do it once in your life time  Of course going in  we knew that Burj had exceptional service  but they were defintely a few notches above most hotels  During our butler s  quot orientation quot   he mentioned that they could change the mattress if it was too soft hard  Taking up the offer  we made the request  When we came back from dinner that night  the mattress had been replaced  We had late check out as our flight was at mid night  Even after the check out  we could still use all the amenities of the hotel  We kept a change of clothing in the locker room and went about exploring the city  After dinner  we were able to use the pool and shower before we head out to the airport  I had a facial at the Spa  It was good but not outstanding  The lady behind the counter at the Spa  Qi Qian   was less than helpful when I was trying to make the appoitment and looked impatient  Also  you could hear people talking in the hallway outside the treatment rooms  which could be slightly irritating when you try to relax Defintely try sui   the new Asian restaurant  if you have the opportunity  The Wagyu beef was absolutely delicious  MMMMM    
N =>  too expensive   a medium result the only good thing of our stay was the weather   All in this hotel is opulence  yes  but      money is money   Incredible    This is not a touristic area      but a bank area   You  ve to pay for eveything a huge amount of money     it s indecent    amp  People just even see you as a Credit Card in hotels   shops  restaurant    well it s not my world 
N =>   They say   star but this wonderful hotel misses the spot The concept and suites are wonderful  you have to be amazed by the grandeur of this hotel  Like other travelers we found the pool wonderful  the Al Mahara restaurant the food was first class but total overpriced with a glass of wine being GBP   or     Dirham  the Friday brunch was a joke at GBP   or     Dirham the cavier bar only served lump fish  amp  Salmon roe  main dishes where rather dull  we saw most of the desserts going back half eaten and I followed the trend and returned most of mine uneaten  The services throughout the hotel is perfect and i was amazed that all the staff knew our name  The fact that they charge to allow visitors all over the hotel makes you feel like you are in a goldfish bowl and i agree with other visitors that this is very annoying when you have paid so much to stay here  All in all we enjoyed our stay but like most other people would not return to this hotel  Dubai has so many very good hotels and go to any of the golf clubs for a better Friday Brunch  
N =>  A special hotel but not the best The Burj is a special hotel  but it should be at the prices they charge  The service  food and room are all excellent but having stayed there once I would not return unless money was no object  Why would I not return  well I think when the novelty factor wears off you could enjoy other hotels just as much  I stayed at the Dinarobin hotel in Mauritius at the start of the same trip and the service and food was of an equal standard  I was expecting the Burj to be better in every sense but I am sure there are alternatives in Dubai which would suit me and my pocket better  
N =>  Sky View Bar     th floor   th      pm myself and   colleagues had a coffee date at the Skyview bar  We had HUGE expectations going into the hotel  especially after just coming from lunch the day before from the Atlantis hotel The start of the experience was great  The driver pulled up to the hotel gate  and security let us in  As we entered the hotel we were greeted by a staff member who had a huge plate of succulent dates  which were top quality After wards we were on our own to roam the hotel  Personally I was expecting some sort of escort to the restaurant  considering the nature of the hotel  But we had free will to roam anywhere we chose  Really cool feature  as you take the escalator up to the main floor of the hotel  adjacent to the escalator is a huge aquarium  with exotic fish So we found the elevator and went up to the   th floor  Where I gave my name to the receptionist  and we were lead to our table  The staff was very courteous and respectful  When we sat at our table  I personally felt the decor was tacky  The couches were a dark leather green  and the ceiling had multiple colors  green  white  blue lighting   The menu that we were provided had a metal cover  and the pages were divided into sections  Each section divider was dark green  with a design that looked like random paint splotches  pink  blue  yellow   Quite ugly in my opinion The menu had a list of drinks  and snack items  We ordered   Yellow Camel drinks  a mango milkshake made with Camel milk  and tea  and a tray of cheese for a total of     Dhms       USD The waitress offered to provide a Pashmina shawl for one of our guests who was chilly    minutes later  no drinks  no shawl  nothing  But people around us were receiving their order  even though they ordered after us  I caught the waitress attention  and asked again for the Shawl     minutes later Shawl arrives  no food  no drinks    more minutes drinks only arrive  The waitress came back some time later  and asks if we need anything else  I say yes  quot THE CHEESE PLS quot   About   hour after sitting down  she returns with a complimentary offering of small pastries  as the cheese still isnt ready   minutes later another waiter arrives with the cheese  but our table was too small to accomodate the cheese  drinks  and complimentary pastries without moving some items around  So the waiter takes the complimentary pastries away    He just takes them  as we are eating them  And replaces them with the cheese  So in essence  they were only complimentary  as long as we were quick enough to eat them      The part that really bugged me the most  was I noticed other patrons around us  received a different menu  that actually had food  They were ordering actual food  outside of just drinks and cheese  Needless to say  the Skyview Bar of the Burj Al Arab was a HUGE HUGE HUGE let down  I was so dissapointed  I knew that I may not meet the expectations of a   star hotel  but I never expected it to be such a shame  
N =>   Its the little things that count Due to some initial communication errors  my stay was delayed a few days  but as it turned out  it was well worth the wait  Needless to say the rooms are spacious and elegant  but it is the little details that makes the difference  Just to mention a few   All the staff seemed to know who I was  I never even got to use my keycard  the butler took care of that  The range of perfumes and other beuty products available in the bathrooms was enormous  The list of these little things just go on and on  Truly an experience    It is only possible to award a rating of   on tripadvisor  but in the case an added category of    would be needed  
N =>  loved it This is the most beautiful hotel i ve ever been too  We did not stay here but maybe one day  But we did have dinner here and wow can not wait to return  I went onto there web address and went thru the dinning options and picked the restarant that best suited us and that was the interntional buffet in the Bab Al Yam poolside restarant  From start to finish it was amazing  we had to show our booking reference to the welcome centre and then we walked towards the hotel with the different coloured lights  the entrance loby is wow  we where greeted by the staff and was told we could have a drink first in the sky bar on floor     we went up by lift and again greeted and shown to our table was given a huge menu and canpes  We then went down to the restaurant the service is second to none as well as the food ok the prices are going to be high but you have to think of the whole experiance and l don t regret it  You help yourselve to all courses which is fine for us there was also a live cooking station  the desserts are my favourite and you don t just have to have one  We went outside for our coffee and the waiter was talking to us very friendly  We not rushed but l could have stayed there forever  If l ever go to Dubai again l would be going back  unfortunalty we have no pictures has we lost our camera which is a huge shame so will have to go back again      
N =>  simply the best Booked the burj to celebrate my wife s   th birthday  I had read all about the burj before hand and was worried it would not live up to my expectations I was wrong  it exceeded them all Driving up to the burj was an amazingsight that made us giggle with delight  We were checked in by security at the bridge who must have informed reception of our arrival  despite it being  am  we were met at the door by welcoming staff with cold drinks and cold towel  paper work was discretly handled in minutes before being taken up the escalators to the internal lifts to our suite on the   st floor  Here our butler took over with the guided tour of our suite  whilst another checked passports etc  The butler was fantastic very reasurring and never overpowering  and never made us feel uncomfortable  he completely put us at our ease  we declined his offer to unpack  but after an overnight flight accepted his offer to run us a special jacuzzi bath  It was very useful to have the guided tour as the suites are huge and packed with gadgets I was worried about tipping and after reading forums decided on tipping the porters    dirrhams bag and our butler     dirrhams  I had to catch the butler to tip him as he was trying to leave very discretly indeed  We arranged a guided tour of the hotel at   am with our butler  this gave us a couple of hours to enjoy the suite  checking out all the amazing freebees  full sized Hermes products for him and her  for the men aftershave  post shave balm  shaving cream  guilette razors  beautiful soaps  shampoo and conditioner  luxury slippers  moisturising cream  full sized toothpaste and colgate toothbrushes  coombes and loads of other stuff  the wife had similar range of goodies including La prarie   spelling  moisturising cream  There was also a bottle of wine  cakes sweats fruit and flowers  Not to mention the laundry bags which came in handy too   am came and we had a personalised tour of the burj  we started at the skybar and worked our way down to the underwater themed restaurant with its private dinning areas  Nick our butler was obviously very proud to work at the burj and took delight in showing us around  all the staff went out of their way to make us feel very welcome indeed  Following the tour we played a game of squash we must have been the only people to have played for ages  they supplied brand new top quality rackets and balls  we were the first to put  ball marks  on the court  we then went to the pool area where we were taken to our sunloungers  towels spread out  sunshade erected and bottles of water and ice came and went without raising a finger  Someone came and cleaned our sunglasses  gave us some water spray and a newspaper The pool area was empty  we were the only ones swimming and felt very protected by the lifeguards  We ordered lunch from the sunloungers and were seated only when the order was ready  I had to order the Wagu beefberger        my wife had a great salad nicoise       and   diet cokes       the menu was reasonably priced except for the wagu  but when in rome the food was worth every penny  We spent the afternoon at the waterpark which was empty   I suspect everyone had gone to the atlantis  no queues at all  We went to the private beach and had similar   star treatment  Then back to the pool for more pampering before back to the suite  We were greated by another butler who poured some wine  changed the fruit bowl and cut up a beautiful fruit tart  I tipped him    dirrhams   we went upstairs  housekeeping had replaced everything and set out the suite for the evening with more chocolates and freebees on the bed  We went to the skybar for a cocktail each at     dirrhams  this included a selection of canapies and was excellent value  we ate at the souk next door in the irianian restaurant  My wife is iranian  and had a fantastic meal at a bargain price  We finally retired back to the burj where housekeeping had turned down the room and left more freebees We slept so comfortably and only just made it to breakfast but glad we did  we ate at the poolside buffet and ate very well indeed  huge selection of food  the best were eggs benedict and florentine  fillet steak and king prawns as well as usual selection  all simply fabulous  The breakfast I thought although fab was just bettered by breakfast at the shangri la hotel singapore   We checked out at midday with bulging suitcases  smelling of Hermes products and thoroughly rested and truely impressed by the Burj  our bill for food and drinks was less than        we even got to keep the  leather key wallet We sadly left the burj to go the Al Maha desert resort for   nights  more at that review but also fantastic   Our overall impression was of surprisingly understated luxury with service one could only dream of  I will be saving up to go again next year  Everyone should go at least once in their lifetime if only for one night  
N =>  What your not told Hello to all of you looking to visit the wonderous Burj al Arab on your visit to Dubai  Throughout all the reviews I have read it tells you time and time again this hotel is a must visit on anyones stay in this city  It has shopping areas  Bars  and great restaurants  All may be well and true but if you are not a guest at the hotel or not booked for one of eiither Breakfast  Lunch or Dinner dont bother paying the taxi fare as you wont be allowed in I had turned up in very smart clothing on the evening as it was my intension to take my wife to shop in Sak s  th Ave and then to go for a drink in the Sky Bar but we were turned away at the gate by security  I have stayed at many top rated hotels with just as good architecture but that has never stopped to intrested tourist access to view what it claims to make it so special  
N =>  Serious WOW factor   We booked into the Burj for the first part of our Honeymoon and found it to be the most magnificent hotel inside and out  so much attention to detail and extremely Luxurious It was a real experiance and definately worth doing for a special occasion  We did find however that was all a little overwhelming and found it hard to relax  our butler contstantly wanting to do things for us  staff coming in alot to tidy up  We ended up going to its sister hotel accross the road to use thier pool as we found it more relaxing there The skybar do amazing cocktails and not much more expensive than london prices approx         each and definately worth the view We had a lovely surprise when we arrived back to our room on the first night to champagne and a choclate cake to congratulate us on our wedding  along with roses chocolates on the bed such a nice touch  
N =>   Burj oh beautiful Burj  My family   adults and   kids stayed at the Burj for a week on our way back from Europe  We had stayed at the Al Qsar on the way over to Europe We had an excellent stay at Al Qsar but every day we would look out the window and upwards to the worlds only   star hotel  We decided you only live once so why not splurge on our return visit to Dubai and stay at the magnificent Burj  We arrived in the early hours of the morning and we were told whilst still on board the plane that we may not be able to get to our hotel as several main roads in dubai would be closed due to a US VIP who was visiting Dubai  Luckily we arrived in Dubai just before the streets were locked down  When we arrived at the Burj we were advised that the VIP would be arriving at the hotel that morning and as such all our belongings would need to be xrayed  They said there would be alot of extra security and we would not be able to leave the hotel or move around the hotel for most of the day  The VIP turned out to be president Bush  We were shown to our suite but we were all eghausted so went straight to sleep without taking too much in  When we awoke we were all very hungary and ready to test some of the Burj room service   quot Sorry Madame but due to the VIP coming we cannot get any room service to you as the lifts have been shut down  We will send your butler to the suite to explain the situation  quot  The butler arrived and apologised profusely when he realised they had not thought to make arrangements for a hungry family of four  We had travelled most of the night so were probably not in the best shape to deal with the thought of not being able to eat or move from our room for most of the day  We also had an issue with the blinds in the room  We were promptly upgraded to a two bedroom suite and arrangements were made to get us fed  The two bedroom suite was magnificent words cannot describe how unbelievable it was from the size to the attention to detail and the wonderful view  There were   flatscree tv s a lounge room dining room kitchen area and two massive bedrooms upstairs both with enormous ensuite bathrooms with full size hermes products  Every night a little gift was left on our pillows lip balm  sleep spray  la prairie face cream  perfumes and chocolates  Our room was filled with fresh flowers   The butler would come every night with a selection of nibbles and drinks  Our butler would fill the childrens bath of an evening for us and we were suprised he actually asked what our preferred tempreture would be  Having never really thought about that before we left it to the butlers discretion  We ordered some of the worlds most expensive room service most nights but it again was unbelievable  The kids had burgers that were delivered in there own Burj packaging similar to McDonalds  The meat patty in the burger is made from none other than Waygu beef We went to the Skybar one evening to sample Burj cocktails  The mixologist comes around with his cart of fresh fruits and various spirits to hand mix your cocktail  I had two of the most wonderful cocktails I have ever tasted I sampled the spa which was also an exceptional experience  There facials are amazing I felt pampered and younger as a concequence The indoor swimming pools  there are two  both overlooked Dubai and the ocean  One is ladies only in keeping with Muslim requirements  These spaces were lovely with heating swimming pools and spas and were empty most times we used them   felt like they were our own private sanctuary Used the hotel cars regualary to go shopping  The rolls were gorgeous  The shopping in Dubai is also fantastic  Had to slow down or buy more bags   bought more bags Kids club in the hotel is small but available free to inhouse guests  Our kids went a couple of times to play computer games and most times were the only kids in there so not the place for kids to meet other little ones The architecture lights  fountains  fish tanks and water features are amazing  We were told that the hotel is closed to tourists but we saw several hundred of them every day in the foyer area and on the first floor  Lots of cameras snapping and it sometimes was a little hard to move freely through these areas without the feeling you would be imposing on peoples photos  Was a little annoying  We also strolled around the building one afternoon only to be stopped twice whilst our guest information was checked  Very high levels of security which is good but left you a little uncomfortable about being constantly watched We got to know the guy downstairs who serves the tea and dates to guests coming and going  He was delightful and ensured he always had a burj chocolate for the children  Finally this was a very expensive but brilliant experience  I still dream of the Burj often and hope I will return again in the future  If you get the chance to experience the unique and beautiful Burj you will not be dissappointed  Part of this hotels mission statement is to never say no to a guest regardless of the request  You will not be disappointed  
N =>   Fantastic Service  We actually stayed at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  sister hotel  but we went to the Burj in the allocated time slots for drinks We went up to the Skybar after taking in the OTT cars  decor   and people  When we arrived at Skybar we wanted to sit by the glass  for the view   the waitress said they had a free table for us  so starting to walk towards it  but what she didn t know was that another waiter had just given it to someone else  We then had to sit on another table  not so good  Then suddenly   mins later the waitress brought us over   FREE glasses of champagne   Wow  You would not get service or compensation like that at home  Plus the champagne was     per glass   so bargain  However  we did buy   ridiculously priced cocktails after  Which  I have to say  were delicious I think you have to be slightly deluded to stay here  if you think its reality Im sure Im mistaken  It was like a theme park or tourist attraction than a hotel  I so prefered The Jumeirah or the Al Qasr  They were bigger and offered more amenities  x x 
N =>   Deserves the hype   Me and my wife stayed at the Burj as part of our honeymoon We had booked a helicopter transfer  but due to delays in our flight  the hotel had to cancel this  but provided Rolls Royce transfers instead From the moment we checked in  it was obvious   this was no ordinary hotel  The decor is outstanding  the attention to detail is stunning  and the rooms are just amazing Our room was more like an apartment  Set over two floors  with the biggest jacuzzi bath I have ever seen  The staff couldn t do enough to make us feel special  even giving us a choclate cake  and flowers to celebrate our marriage Put simply  this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at   in terms of pure luxury  We loved the Burj  and will DEFINATELY try to go back one day  
N =>  good and bad    Only a few coments as there is enough to read from others here  We were particularly worried about the staff  asking for tips  described in other reviews  It was not a problem  Start as you mean to go on and don t tip the luggage porters  There is a very good DND    do not disturb  system operated via the TV  high tech and over complicated but it is worth the effort to get this explained  and also a low tech card thing to hang on the door  These worked for us  Good things    You have to try the frozen youghurt at breakfast  better than ice cream and you can pretend it s healthy and the express lift to   th floor   so says my partner Staff everywhere were discreet and managed to leave you alone but were there if you wanted them  Bad things  The over long explanation of the window drapes  the tv  dvd  laptop  the lights  the temperature control  the shower  the bath  the safe  the pillow menu  I am not joking  etc etc etc    The Al ha Restaurant  an extremely tacky  submarine  ride to a table by a giant fish tank  I was told repeatedly that a jacket was required  so I obliged  but this did not seem to apply to all the other male diners  On checking out they attempted to charge us for breakfast that should have been included and managed to duplicate the cost of dinner and charge us twice  A month later and we re still trying to get a refund  Check carefully before you leave  it s not as if they haven t got enough out of you already  
N => Indulgent Afternoon Tea at the Skyview Bar Booked Indugent Afternoon Tea at the Skyview Bar on the   th Floor We were going to be late as we couldn t get a taxi from our hotel When we called to advise them they were fine and told us not to rush and that they d hold out booking When we arrived we were quickly seated   to enjoy a leisurely afternoon of being spoilt   all after a glass of Moet and Chandon on arrival It was everything and more than you would expect from a   star hotel  Its a definite must and one for the ladies  
N =>   OTT We stayed here for   days for our wedding anniversary  We ve stayed in some top hotels around the world and been treated pretty good but this was a whole other experience  It is definitely a once in a lifetime thing  I m glad we did it but I wouldn t do it again  We ate at the roof top restaurant and the food was excellent and so was the view  Given the rating of this hotel I didnt find the cost too bad  approx      for   courses plus cocktails   The location is great if you want to stay in the immediate area for the sister hotels  Emerates mall and Water park  but we found getting around very stressfull due to the amount of construction traffic congestion and wreckless driving style of taxis The butlers buzzed round like annoying flies and it became tedious to have to keep swatting them away  They even let themselves into our room whilst I was in the bath despite have informed us earlier that we would have to buzz them in  It was to bring us flowers and chocs for our anniversary but they wouldn t leave them  they wanted to hand them over personally  I assume to get tips  so they took the gifts away again and came back    minutes later making us late for our dinner booking My advice would be to stay here for   nights  then book yourself into somewhere else in the old part of town for a bit of peace and to soak up more of the culture  
N =>   Loved The Burj        Can t wait to go back   Having only ever had Afternoon Tea at Burj al Arab we promised ourselves we would one day stay here and realised our dream earlier this month I know there are lots pf people think this hotel is OTT and Tacky but I didn t feel this at all  Well apart from Skyview Bar Arriving by hotels BMW   Series I must admit we felt a bit apprehensive about staying here and worried we would be out of our depth but on check in we very quickly dismissed those feelings We were taken straight to our suite after being meet by many smiling faces at the entrance and inside the lobby  Receptionist could not have been more friendly  asking us how our flights had been etc  Once inside our suite       we had to contain our excitement while we were shown around by our Butler Cliff  He explained all the gadgets to work TV  Curtains  Door etc and I really had to try hard not to look overcome  We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne  bottle of red wine and very posh French Water along with all the Herme s goodies in the bathrooms  I was in heaven  So was hubby  he was even checking that I didn t have more Herme s than him After the Butler left our suite we jumped up and down and said to each other  quot This is the Life quot  Well it was only for   days  We decided to chill out on our first day after travelling for nearly    hours so we got showered and changed into our bathrobes and slippers ready to relax for the day Later in the afternoon we thought we had better unpack and just after we had finished another Butler came to our suite with a bottle of Dom Perignon Vintage Champers  Wow  What had we done to deserve this  it wasn t as if we stated a Special Occassion or anything  Butler said  quot Nice bottle of Champagne with Compliments from the Management quot  As he was pouring it a Front of House Manager called  Jari Neilson  mislaid his card unfortunately  and asked if we were happy with our suite to which we replied  quot Yes Thank you very much quot  He then said  quot I would like to upgrade you to a Two Bedroom Suite which wasn t available when you checked in this morning quot  My hubby and I looked at each other in astonishment and didn t really know what to say  We very gracefully declined and told said man we were very happy where we were but thanked him so much for the lovely gesture  Yes  we were crazy and if we hadn t unpacked and had been dressed we would have gone like a shot We had  quot Private Dining quot  which was very good and not overly expensive  Well we had to drink our Dom Perignon After a great nights sleep in a very comfy and massive bed  Word of advice  Don t look up  Could have done without that mirror  we had breakfast in Al Iwan where we were to have it for both days  Great Selection of food and we loved the corner booths looking out into the lobby  Staff in there were so friendly and always making sure we had everything we needed  We then went out for the day  I really didn t want to  and on return smiling faces greeted us from the taxi  quot Welcome back Mr  amp  Mrs               Lovely when they know your name as soon as you arrive  We ate out at Nina in One  amp  Only on our second night and really wish now we had dined at the Burj Upon return we were greeted in the same way and our floor consierge informed us a BMW   Series would be taking us across to Dar Al Masyaf around       am next morning  The girl even knew which type of room we had booked at DAM  Unfortunately this did not materialise but will do seperate review on that So back to room to pack up to go next day and already were feeling quite sad  We have never stayed in a hotel where the staff were so wonderful  We were made to feel really special and there were much more important guests staying than us I just loved the opulence and splendour of the whole place and could very easily get used to it  Well for a while anyway On check out the next morning we were feeling a bit deflated and when the bell boys started to wave us off I nearly cried  My hubby kept looking back and saying  quot Bye Bye Burj  Sad Will we return    Too right we will  just as soon as the Bank Balance allows LOLJust a little tip  you may take it or you may not but if you decide to have a couple of nights at the Burj Al Arab I suggest you leave them to the end of your trip as after staying there the other hotels have a lot to live up to  In our experience anyway  
N =>   Afternoon Tea   at the Burj Al Arab      Star   I didn t actually stay in the hotel  but really wanted to experience the   star hotel life style for an afternoon whilst in Dubai   So decided to book afternoon tea prior to our arrival in Dubai On arrival at the hotel guest centre our details were check and the taxi was allowed to proceed to the main entrance  where we were greeted by hotel staff and shown to the lobby bar   The hotel is just fantastic  it is totally over the top  but that s what I expect from a   star hotel Afternoon tea was actually a   course tea  served with Champagne  Sandwiches  Beef Wellington  Sorbet  Tea coffee hot chocolate  get to choose from a verity of different teas and coffees  Scones  Cakes and Sweets  It cost about    or    pounds each but was well worth the money  just for the experience So if you have not quite got the money to stay here for the night then book afternoon tea just to see the hotel  really is worth the money  Fantastic   A day I ll never forget  
N =>   Fabulous  Everyone should stay here at least once  it was unbelieavable  The rooms will delight and surprise even seasoned travellers  We found the service fine  did not use the pool or restaurants as not really family orientated but it is easy to get a buggy wherever you want to go on the Jumereih strip  Loved the whole OTT vibe  yes people coming in just to say they ve been to the Burj for dinner drinks whatever can be annoying but once you are in your beautiful room with its beautiful marble staircase chandelier they are forgotten Would love to go back one day and arrive on the helipad    
N =>   Awesome but disappointing  I ll start by saying the room and building itself are just an awesome site   don t get me wrong  And just to say that I ve stayed at the Burj Al Arab will be something that I really don t ever anticipate knowing anyone else will be able to match in my group of friends  However  I was disappointed by some of the service provided  For the money paid   I was expecting to be wowed  The check in was a bit of a cluster and the check out was as well  In fact  the entire stay went to h    once we recieved our checkout bill  They have no real organized way to control the madness down at the entrance and they are trying to get people onto shuttles taxi s incoming passengers etc and you are in the middle of the maddness  The fitness center was lacking as well for such a nice place  It was nothing better than a hilton fitness center  All in all we don t regret staying there   but we will never do it again   merely for the price  
N =>  Over the top I turn    at The Burj  It was amazing all the way around  They start by picking you up at the airport and taking you to the front of the customs and imigration lines  When we got outside I was given roses as we steped into the car  Upon arrival  we were greeted by a line of staff members giving us cold towels  figs and drinks  The suites are just wonderful  It s like a Trump building except this is the REAL thing  The  quot underwater quot  restaurant was very good and it s fun to go on the  quot submarine ride quot  to get there  We only stayed here   night before a trip to the Seyshelles but it was a great way to kick off a   th birthday  A note   I think you have to request the special airport pickup  It s totally worth it whatever it costs  If you re spending this much it s a drop in the bucket  
N =>   A wonderful experience  My wife and I spent three wonderful nights at the Burj on our way home from Abu Dhabi  We were spoilt by the well trained staff  Our butler and his helpers were polite and very helpful  My wife was taken ill during our last evening   No fault of the hotel  I called room service at   am  The Butler sent a Paramedic within ten minutes  He was able to give my wife an injection and we were able to travel home When we checked out I was suprised to be told there was no charge for the Paramedic  My wife was collected from our room by wheelchair  We were taken to the airport and met with another wheelchair  Well done the Burj   I forgot to mention the food was very good  If you have time try eating in your room  Quite an experience  We are pensioners but hope to return soon  Colin from Devon UK  
N =>   Luxury We stayed here for   nights to break our return to UK from Australia  We arrived before our check in time and had to wait for our room   we were given a complimentary lunch of our choice while we waited  The staff made our wait as comfortable as possible  We didnt have a problem with this as we knew the hotel was fully booked   we had no control over our flight times so we were prepared for this  Our room was fab     storey  we had our own butler who was helpful and genuinely a nice guy  We wanted for nothing  Yes  the dinner menu was expensive but what do you expect  Could not fault anything   being spoilt was a great end to our holiday  If you go to Dubai and your budget allows  stay here   you will be sorry if you dont  You can only go into the Burj if you are staying there or have a dinner reservation Luxury    is exactly what it is   if I return to Dubai this is where I will stay   no doubt about it  
N =>  Burj Al Arab is really luxury WOW   Got a taxi to outside the   star Burj Al Arab Hotel s  famous new hotel  security gatehouse  I managed to have lunch at Wild Wadi  theme park  before entering Burj Al Arab  I managed to escape from being splashed by the waterfall  to keep my smart clothes dry for posh Burj Al Arab   The security guard had allowed me to go to Burj Al Arab with my afternoon tea reservation letter  I walked towards Burj Al Arab and went in   WOW  very luxury lobby  I could not believe I met the same Japanese ladies whom I met the day before  during our Sundowner Dune Dinner Safari tour   We took photos there  We entered the Skyview Bar on the   th floor for the afternoon tea  The bar staff were very friendly towards us  They allowed us to take photos there  Nice tea  sandwiches  pretty little fancy cakes  etc  I felt full up   The Japanese ladies left there before  pm  I stayed on until the dark evening for the night view of Dubai  It was really fantastic  I also took some photos of the luxury fairytale lifts corridors  I went down to the lobby   I liked the colourful carpet  I walked back to the taxi stand outside Wild Wadi  theme park   I know it was very expensive  but it was really worth visiting  
N =>   An experience we ll never forget  Well what can we say that hasn t already been said about the Burj We booked through Amex   got the free brekkie  free massage late check out and upgrade if avialable  We spent   nights at the Mina Salem   our last night was to be at the Burj   the Mina called ahead to let the Burj know that we were coming   and off we went on the buggy  When we arrived we were greated warmly and checked in   to a   bedroom suite   so we got our upgrade We got there at      am and our suite was ready and waiting for us   we loved our tour of the hotel  loved looking up into that big atrium  but were eager to finally see the famous suites  So in we went   well we were staggered   as everyone said we would be  The suite was       square foot      bathrooms    bedrooms    bar area    dinning room  with   seater table     living room and a wonderful spiral staircase  Our floor to ceiling windows looked out over palm island   which was great as it really gave us perspective over the whole massive project  We also had   plasma tv s   yes we used them all We too enjoyed all the freebies   the dates  cheesey nibbles and the sweet nibbles  the bottle of wine  all the Hermes toiletries  the slippers  the flip flops and the beach bag   and yes we brought quite a few pieces home with us  Why not   we paid enough for our   night Anyway after all the suite expolration   we headed down to the pool   very nice sun loungers  great service   interesting other guests   good people watching place  I actually spent quite a lot of time in the hot tub   nice and relaxing not too hot and gets the sun in the afternoons We had a lovely lunch by the pool   then went up to the sky bar to watch the sunset and look at the amazing views  have to say that the sky bar was very oddly decorated   kind of distracted you from the view Back down in our suite nice Mr Butler had delivered a cheese plate which we enjoyed very much whilst we tried out the   whirlpool jacuzzi s Next morning we had the buffet breakfast which was delicious   not sure how much it would cost normally   it was part of our package  As we had late check out we were able to have our room till  pm   which was great as we had a late flight that night  so we spent another day by the pool and then headed up to the spa   had a great massage and really enjoyed hanging out in the pool area looking at the twinkling lights of Dubai The Burj really was everything we thought it would be   over the top almost gaudy but yet somehow managing to stay amazing and non tacky  There were plenty of people flashing their cash but also plenty of people like us   just there for the experience  I reccomend it   for a once in a lifetime stay  Would we go back   maybe if we had new people to take with us   i really think thats the beauty of it   your first memorable visit  
N =>  ok but not heaven  Myself and my wife stayed at the burj as part of a our   destination stop  We arrived in style being picked up at the airport in a air conditioned luxury  x   We arrived at  am and I was very disappointed that we had to wait until  pm for our room to be prepared  We were told that we could use the Spa anf gym facilities whilist we waited and we informed that this was on the   th floor  I was not impressed with this as there was no real direction and after a long flight all we wanted was to chill out  We we hust left to our own devices  For a hotel of such stature I expected more  Finally when the room was ready it was amazing and a designated butler on each floor was extremely helpful night and day  I enjoyed that food that was very good and on our first night we ate at the newly opened asian themed resturant on the LG floor  excellent food and the next night we ate at the Al aha which was superb and excellent wine  at a price of course  The burj is very OTT but something that needs to be experinced once  The let down was the initial arrival probs so I would recommend that you clarify this before you book  I will always remember our final day breakkie that cost me       ouch   
N =>   Out of this world What can you say about the Burj  The first word that comes to mind is WOW  We went there last year as part of our honeymoon  After visiting Penang  Langkawi and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this was the absolute icing on the cake  We arrived early in the morning and were greeted by a member of staff at the airport  This actually guaranteed an express service through the airport  We had booked a Rolls Royce to pick us up from the airport    after all it was our honeymoon  We informed the hotel about the early arrival in advance but they did not guarantee an early check in  However  when we got there about     AM they checked us straight in  Brilliant  I was so excited I could hardly sleep  Our butler offered to empty our suitcases but I did not want him to  As they knew that it was our honeymoon  they gave us this gorgeous chocolate cake and some gorgeous roses  There were always fresh flowers in the room  There are loads of other things in the room from the Hermes products which you can take home to a selection of sweets  There was something else on the bed every night from chocolates to little toiletries  You also got different canpees every night before going out  The food in the hotel is brilliant  You have got two different restaurants where you can have breakfast  We also tried the Sky Bar and Restaurant  Food is brilliant and the views are amazing  We also went to the Seafood Restaurant  which can be reached by buggy or you can walk  It is part of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel but as a guest of the Burj you are also welcome  We went there before and it was great  One lunchtime we decided to have a buffet lunch on the second level of the hotel lobby  It was very expensive      a head       but it was seafood and we only noticed the price when we got the bill  I can t comment on the hotel pool as we never used it but with a gorgeous beach who needs to     white sand       clear water and the service at the beach second to none  You get fresh water all the time and the waiters come round with little fruit shoots and cold towels for your face Someone said that you pay for what you get  That s true but it is so much worth it  I want to go back but probably have to save up for a while Spacious luxurious accommodation  superb food  friendly staff  a gorgeous beach       what else could you ask for  
N => I Loved The Burj  I Am Dreaming To COme Back Soon  We had a great time this y visiting this fabulous hotel  What can I say  From the meeting at the airport with the Burj representatives and passing the customs as VIPS to the transfer to the hotel with their Rolls Royce and when we arrived everything was out of this world  the architecture of the hotel was so impressive  the service excellent   our butler Ashan was perfect  As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary  I do not remember how many bouqouets of roses they brought us  I loved the Hermes products they gave us The restaurants were fantastic  The Assawan Spa was magnificent  After staying at Soneva Gili and Hilton Rangali in the Maldives I finished my trip with a stay at Burj We are now seeing our videos taken from this trip and we are looking forward to staying at Burj again  
N =>  wonderful   over the top but just great We booked a stay of   nights at the Burj after getting a good deal through an on line travel agent  I would like to point out that the price didn t matter though  as the service was superb Our only grumble was the food in the under sea restaurant  but as this is the worlds only   star hotel we shouldn t really  I really enjoyed the food upstairs in the    s style disco restaurent overlooking the sea  Make sure you book before the sun goes down to enjoy this one to the full Anyways  service   fantasticRooms   even the cheapest suite is amazinguse of facilities   greatfood  even the buffet breakfast choice couldn t be bettered anyway  I think you get my drift Use of the hotel allows full use of the sister hotels facilities  and will give you free access to the water park  I say free  but in fact they give you free towels  and a token worth    dm to use in the park to buy food  amp  drinks  so in fact they pay you to go  and take you everywhere in their fleet of buggies Fantastic hotelGreat people Enjoy it  You will never get better Anywhere  
N =>   Stayin  at the Burj    My wife and I booked a stay at the Burj for two nights in late y       If you want the quick and dirty  it s pricey and I truly don t think it s worth it  If you are looking for a unique experience and are middle or high middle income  it s better to use your money on shopping  That s my two cents   my other ninety eight follows       Prior to leaving  I hadn t been contacted on how I would be met at the airport  They hadn t even sent email asking when I would arrive  I called the limo service at the Burj and asked if we were going to be picked up  Would you like the Rolls Royce or the BMW He s asking me  Who would pass up a ride in a Rolls Royce Phantom   But wait   why is he asking me such an obvious question Do you charge additional for airport pick ups Yes  sir  The Phantom is      AED and the BMW is      Needless to say  the BMW was a good ride   P     Arrived at the airport  which we had to walk for about    minutes from the plane to customs  by the way  and were met by a Burj representative right before customs  He was very cool and let us know where to meet him after customs Customs was quick and so was bag pick up  We went out to find our driver to no avail  We had to stop at the Jumeirah desk to ask them where to go  About one minute later another driver came and picked us up The ride over was very nice  Our driver was kind  of course  and met my wife with a nice multi colored bouquet of roses and some cold hand cloths  We were given a book with about    choices of CDs to listen to on the    minute trip  Along the way  our driver gave us little tidbits of information about the buildings in Dubai and the Burj  Good stuff Once at the hotel  which really does look fantastic   we were met by staff members that set us down in the lobby  gave us more hand cloths and some dates to try while they grabbed our baggage to take to the room  I paid for the two nights stay  which they flagged       AED on my credit card for  and off we were to the room I thought the room was a bit over done  frankly  a little tacky with the colors  but it was very comfortable  A remote control handled everything in the suite to include the curtains  tv and front door  etc  Our butler  James  showed us around the suite  explaining everything and before leaving  we asked him to set up a jacuzzi bath for us  James was amazing during our stay  Any question we had  he answered very precisely  The room did have cool amenities like free Hermes after shave and cologne for men and some perfume for women  We had fresh fruit every day  They had a very nice laptop with very fast internet Food  Each morning we ate the breakfast buffet  it was pretty good  but nothing extraordinary  I think it was about     AED per person  but can t remember  We ate in Al Mahara  the restaurant with the large aquarium  My wife and I are sincerely people that are easy to impress  but the food was not all that great  I think we paid about      AED  Service was good and it was fun to look at the tank from time to time  If you eat there  you ll probably get a visit from George  one of the fish that constantly hovers over each table  pretty cute  We didn t eat anywhere else and I regret not trying out Al Muntaha on the   th floor All in all  the Burj was a fun experience  After we left  and stayed at Al Qasr just next door  we realized that the Burj actually felt like home  not like a hotel room  It genuinely felt like our place  That s a very unique experience for only two days  Yet  I still feel it was too pricey  The room  food and tipping costs were pretty significant So  Hope this helps  It s nice to be pampered  but it s gonna cost you  
N =>   Just OK My husband and I spent two nights in a Panoramic Suite        We booked this stay last minute through American Express and paid      USD night  There was nothing about this stay that was worth that price  We spent the first   hours with the IT people trying to get the WiFi service to work in the room   as my husband had to communicate with his office  The view was fantastic  but I felt the suite almost tended towards tacky  it was so overdone  There was alot of gold  and cool electric sunshades  but when the people in the suite next to us raised or lowered their sunshades  it was very loud in our suite The butler service was pretty attentive  but I don t really see it as an added value to the stay The pool areas were overcrowded and there were not alot of attendants tending to guests  My advice is don t book more than one night  The hotel will not let you leave early without paying for the full stay   and I have a feeling many guests try to do this  Another odd thing about this hotel    we pre paid the room  but when we checked in  the butler asked for our credit card  and brought us back a receipt explaining that they had blocked out       UAE for incidental charges  I have never seen a hotel block a specific amount for charges  We moved from the Ritz Carlton in Dubai which did not block my credit card for incidental charges  I almost have to wonder if alot of their guests overspend on the      breakfasts       lunches and      dinners and can t pay the bill  Try one night and if you love it  then extend your stay  
N =>   All we thought and more All we wanted  no diffrence in treatment from what we saw Super rich or enjoying luxuary  Room stunning Food expensive but great  Drinks in hotel OUCH  dont go near the mini bar  already planning a return  so much to see and do in Dubai  Dress smart and enjoy the whole thing   The sky bar is a visual treat  Contact me if you want   Well travled and I think real opinions  Loads of photos onlt too willing to share them on E mail 
N =>   Nice hotel but losing its class This was our  rd stay at the Burj al Arab and marked differences were noted  I had emailed the hotel previously to request a high floor suite and make a booking at the Al Mahara restaurant and these requests were confirmed within    hours  We had stayed in the Shangri La hotel prior to our arrival at the Burj at      am and were advised our suite was not ready but should be within the hour  We were offered tea coffee in the mezzanine area which was fine and we were happy to wait  However  at        no one had come to see us and I had to ask what the situation was  We were advised it should be approximately a further    minutes      minutes later someone came and said our suite was ready  Not really the best start  We were then shown our standard duplex suite on the   rd floor  strange coincidence but this was exactly the same suite        that we had a couple of years ago  The gentleman on reception showed us around the suite  not the butler as there didn t appear to be one around  and quickly whizzed through everything  He mentioned there were a couple of changes  such as a flat screen TV in the bedroom now and the Hermes products had changed  ditto the style of the slippers beach bag etc    rd floor is the highest floor you can get for a normal suite as floor    holds   presidential suites and floor    the   royal suites  We had a view of the Palm Jumeirah which has a lot more construction on it than before   the hotel provides a telescope in the room to enable the guests to look at this in more detail  We had reservations the first evening at Al Mahara and walked to the  quot submarine quot  but previously had been escorted by the butler  The meal was fine and the service was very good but I found the choice to be a little limited  Beware wine prices   I chose a cheaper bottle which was      the normal seemed to be about           The next evening  we chose to hop on a buggy to Mina al Salam and an abra to Al Qasr   had a great steak in MJs steakhouse and the service was excellent The third and final night  we were invited to the manager s cocktail party between       pm  Again  no escort by the butler from the floor  which has been done previously   We met a couple of the department managers  Chandra  head of housekeeping and Felix  Asst Manager in the Skyview bar  who were really nice  Chandra kindly offered to show us around the presidential suite the next day  as we had previously looked at the royal suite  even though they were being redecorated  We decided to eat at the Thai restaurant at Al Qasr  Great meal and excellent service again  At   am the next day  Chandra collected us and we went to the   th floor to view the presidential suite  This was absolutely fantastic  There are two bedrooms and the colours are blues yellows in comparison to the gaudy red golds of the royal suite  The bathroom is beautiful and much more subtle than the royal  We thanked him profusely  and of course tipped him  for allowing us to have a look around  I also mentioned the change in Hermes products offered in the rooms and explained my mother loved the old products when she was there a couple of years ago  He was so kind when we left and gave me some of the old products to take home for her  We went to the pool for a couple of days and on the first day were shown to a sunbed  had a towel laid out  given a bottle of water  evian and lavender face sprays and had an umbrella put up for us  On the second day  there was no one around and we did everything ourselves but found other people were assisted later  We had to ask for a bottle of water  The only thing I may be able to say in their defence  is that it was extremely windy  due to a cyclone affecting the Middle East  and they were busy due to these high winds  Overall  the rooms are always great  wonderfully spacious  cleaned perfectly and products replaced regularly  The downside is that security has lapsed with people entering the hotel  Before  it was just for people who were staying there  had dining or high tea reservations  Now  at certain times of the day  any guest of a jumeirah hotel can gain entrance  thus leaving you to fight your way through a throng of people to get onto escalators  People were also coming to the floors to hang over the balconies to take photographs  I thought this detracted from the hotel s exclusivity and I m not sure it s the best way to go if they want to retain their reputation as a high class hotel  
N => Does not live up to the hype We spent twon nights here in transit through dubai   Going through dubai there seemed to be only one choice of hotel  but in the end the whole experience was rather tacky     The suite was gigantic  we had over    m of floorspace  which was all a bit too much  the extra bedroom for example was not realy needed  the style is basically over the top gaudy  and despite all the space you have no outside space so are stuck in the a c environment the whole time      They talked us into visiting the  quot underwater quot  restaurant which was all an enormous hassle  they started off telling me my shoes would not be acceptable so after going out and buying shoes they said   oh and you do have a jacket and tie     this being dubai a jacket is the last thing I expected to need but they lent me one and off we went in the phoney submarine   this should alert you to the fact that you are not heading to a quality dining experience      the food was overpriced and too salty to be edible and overall very unimpressive     My general view of places that impose dress codes are that they do this as an admission that their general clientele are not a classy bunch  in Tokyo I have never been to a restaurant with any dress code as people tend to dress well at all times  places like the burj can impose silly codes that annoy cutomers  but a jacket and shoes with laces are not going to prevent customers from being loud  annoying and poorly behaved      
N =>   Fun to Experience We stayed in a panoramic suite while on our way to the Maldives  I am glad we stopped because it was a memorable experience and broke up our long trip  Dubai is a unique place and there are a lot of fun things to do and see while there  I wasn t too impressed with the shopping  it s just like any other large city  same stores  same prices  I actually prefer NYC  London or Paris because you get to walk around outside and see sights  in Dubai everything is inside and I find that less enjoyable  We visited one mall when we spent a few hours snow skiing indoors  For some reason I wasn t expecting it to be that cold  but it was  I was just wearing a long cotton dress  I do advise women to cover up out of respect  although there are those who do not  and I got very cold  but I do get cold easily  like most women do   It was a fun few hours  More exciting was the dune buggy ride in the desert  It is soooo fun and a crazy adventure  A tad scary because you are just strapped into this little buggy which goes pretty fast and you whip around the dunes in a caravan  Of course I got stuck a few times and had to be pulled out  but they were nice about it  I highly recommend going on the buggies  but keep in mind that if you are  or are with  a prissy girl  you get really dirty  sand gets EVERYWHERE   and it is a little scary  We stayed for the BBQ dinner and belly dancing  which was fun  but I would have preferred going back earlier  it takes about an hour to get out there  and having a nice dinner somewhere  but not at the Al Mahara   The Gold Souk was fun to walk around in for a while  but everything felt cheap to me  so we didn t purchase anything The Burj is fun  It s exactly like the pictures  very opulent  Our room was huge  and of course the mirror is a fun surprise  even when you know about it   They are obviously very attentive to your needs  Our room service breakfast was delicious  and they had lots of fresh fruit and little treats as well  Oh  and the Hermes toiletries  All wonderful  I guess my only complaint was our experience at the Al Mahara  We enjoy indulging every once in a while  but chose not to go crazy here because the wine prices were just ridiculous  They are absurd even for a   star hotel  The food was terrible overall  And they served shark fin soup in a restaurant centered around an absolutely stunning aquarium with sharks swimming around  Seemed kind of backwards to me  Anyways  the bread and desserts were good  but the everything else was not  They are trying to be sophisticated and modern and it s just not happening  furthermore the ingredients did not seem of the finest quality  And the simulated submarine voyage is kind of cheesy  like a ride at Disney  We still had a memorable time regardless So  it s fun  a unique experience to tell your friends about and show off some pictures  I doubt we will go back to Dubai again  unless it s a stopover  but it we had a fabulous time and I think if you can  spend a little money for the experience  
N =>  How I Got the Best Value on the Room Booking I noticed that there are many ways to book a hotel room  You can call the property directly  book though the actual hote s website  find on eof the very popular websites like Expedia  amp  Travelocity  etc  You can also book through a travel agency and finally  you can find other websites that maybe heretofore unknown  You might think it takes a leap oof faith to go with an unknown website  BUT in reality there is NO risk in doing this b c unlike purchasing a product on a website  amp  paying for it before you actually get it  when a making a typical hotel reservation  you are merely offering your credit card to  quot guarantee quot  your reservation  Heck  in many cases you can even cancel a  quot guaranteed quot  reservation w o penalty as long as you do so a day ro two before the reserved arrival date  And as long as you use a website  that s backed by something like a physical location or people that answer their phones  amp  you can talk to  OR you find a site that has a secure online booking connection it s SAFE  amp  very worthwhile  When searching for the best value on room rates at The Burj Al Arab  that oftentimes  quot in Season quot  go for well over      USD per night  I came across       that overall had a better price than the big  known sites on the standard suite only booking PLUS  they threw in complimentary perks that enhanced the value even more  Although I booked it across their secure booking engine w o talking to anybody  I did call them later to be sure all was in order and so far everything has panned out w oa hitch  They do charge     to make a booking if one of their agents does it for you but you can pocket this if you just use their online booking engine  
N =>  Burj   absolutely fantastic hotel  We had been warned to expect absolute luxury  but nothing prepared us for our visit to the Burj  From the Butler service to the friendliness of the staff to the opulent surroundings   nothing was left to chance  If there are any hotels better than this in the world  i would like to visit  because I cannot imagine being made more welcome  We stayed at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi  but it was nothing compared to the Burj  We are definitely going back to the Burj when I save up  but the visit to Emirates Palace was a one off for the experience  All in all  if you aren t satisfied with the Burj  there is something seriously wrong with you   
N =>   One of the most Memorable Weeks of our Lives My wife and I stayed here in ember for the  rd time  on this occasion for   nights to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary and my birthday I find it really hard to put into words our experience at this wonderful and awesome place  My wife has mobility difficulties and on our last visit    years ago  we were upgraded to a   bedroom Disabled suite on the   th floor I contacted the General Manager  Mr Luc Delafosse  about our planned visit and asked if it would be possible to have use of this suite again  Unfortunately it was booked for our entire stay but he most generously and thoughtfully upgraded us to a   bedroom   bathroom suite which had a  quot ground quot  floor bedroom  on the   st floor  It was a magnificent panoramic suite about   times larger than our home   and furnished and acquitted with the true Burj style and glamour From the welcome at Dubai airport to our final farewells we experienced a standard of service from every member of the hotels staff  some of whom remembered us from out last visit   years ago  that will live in our memories for a very long time  Wonderful meals in all of the restaurants including a dining extravaganza at the seafood restaurant with a complimentary bottle of chamagne to help us celebrate our wedding anniversary  Chocolate cakes and a trio  with guitarist  to sing on my birthday  every day there was something new and yet done just for us The General Manager asked if he could come to see us in our suite and he came with a lovely gift for my wife and all the charm and courtesy you would expect from such a representative of this iconic hotel  A true gentleman and it was our privalege to meet him  We are not royalty  celebrities  or professional footballers  only in my dreams    but we could not have been looked after any better if we were  I really cannot wait to return   God  my bank manager and my wifes health permitting Just a thought but all those reviews from other  I agree stunning  hotels telling us to go there and forget the Burj    a goodly proportion of them feaure more photographs of the Burj  inside and outside  than the hotels they are staying at    HmmmmmI write this review as testimony to and with my thanks to all who made our week one to remember and that includes the friendly guys who cleaned our suite right up to Mr Delafosse and all in between It really cannot get any better   thanks to allJohn and Kath Lancashire UK 
N =>   We wil return    Absolutely fabulous  We have no complaints whatsoever Experience of a lifetime The staff are outstanding  Without any information from ourselves  they arrived at the suite on my partners birthday with a beautiful cake  flowers and a card from the management  Accomodation wonderful  views outstanding  food as you would expect   We can t wait to return  
N => BEAUTIFUL LUXURIOUS AMAZING ARCHITECTURE WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED This hotel was amazing and so beautiful  it was def worth a   star and anyone who said it was less than excellent obviously are used to the   star luxury and do not know when they are seeing a good thing    Fussing over the butlers not knowing where to put your stuff is a bit silly  Everything was lovely and the architecture was amazing inside and out  Def once in a lifetime opportunity if you can afford it   
N =>  Out of this world My wife and I have travelled all over the place  but this hotel has to have been the best we have ever been to  You get picked up at the airport before even going through customs  and are then taken by Rolls Royce to the hotel The sky bar is out of this world  and has the best range of malts  brandys I have even seen I won t say anymore  but do this spend the money on the expericen of a life time  you only live once PS were we booked in for   days and stayed       
N =>   a bit overrated spent two nights at this hotel from   th   th sep  On arrival at this hotel we were told that our room was not ready even though we had checked beforehand that it would be okay to check in at  pm instead of the usual  pm  the staff then ushered us to the lounge for a complimentary tea or coffee while we waited  After a short wait we were then shown to our suite on the   th floor and can honestly say that it was worth the wait  I dont have to go into how luxurious the suites are as i am sure you have all seen the pictures but can honestly say that they were gorgeous but not entirely sure if the suites are worth the seven star rating  After being shown by our butler how to work the remote control for the curtains  door  etc  we thought we would be asked if we would like our cases unpacked but ended up doing it ourselves  The utler then returned to the door a total of seven times to ask us trivial questions that he could have asked on the telephone and asked four times if we wanted him to make a reservation for dinner even though we had told him that we had already booked  Are these guys on commission  A nice touch and I suppose these are what makes this hotel special was that the butler returned to the door again but this time mentioned that he had noticed from my husbands passport when we checked in that it was his birthday and produced a birthday cake and a bouquet of red roses  We had friends join us for drinks in the skybar and for four beers and three spirits with one bottle of mixer it cost us      I knew that the bar was going to be expensive but still thought this a little excessive  Good tip is to go on the golf buggy outside to the madinat and go to the boardwalk pubs  trader vics  left bank etc where the food is half the price as is the alchol and you get a much better relaxed atmosphere  The buffet breakfast at the poolside is excellent and even included fillet steak  The pools themselves let this hotel down as i would have expected something fabulous for the seven star rating  can honestly say the pools at caesars palace las vegas are far superior for a quarter of the price  The freebies in the room are wonderful  including fruit platter every day  welcome bottle of wine  canapes and savoury snacks but best of all are the full size hermes products in the bathroom  which are very luxurious but lets remember how much you are paying to stay here so you would expect nothing less  Overall we had a wondeful stay at this hotel  i think it would be a one off visit for most people  The staff here are friendly  polite and helpful although at times we had to put do not disturb on the door to get some peace  I would reccomend that everyone should try this place just to experience it but im not sure its worth the price tag as its a bit over the top and didnt realise that if you are staying at any of the other jumeria hotels that you can get access to this place after a certain time so felt a bit over run with people just wanting a look at times  
N =>   Ace Service Well  we had to go  just to see what this   star hype was all about The hotel itself does have  without exception  the best service we have ever experienced  perhaps a little too attentive  As soon as one of the   or   porters opens the front door  you have    people waiting to collect you luggage  show you to the restaurant  whatever you want  When we left  a lovely   Series BMW took us to the neighbouring resort  and we only went for afternoon tea The hotel is ostentatious beyond belief  Solid gold columns and aquaariums lining the escalators  Completely over the top  The lift up to the Skyview Bar was long but the glass lift ensured a good view of the Jumeirah Palm  On arrival we were seated  not too close to the windows unfortunately  and provided with a menu of    teas  A good start  Each choice accompanied by a fresh  silver tea strainer The food arrived  and we were horrified      for   tiny sanwiches    miniscule rolls    inch across     slices of malt loaf and some very nice cakes  We would have plenty of room left for dinner  As it happened  the sandwiches and rolls were never ending  So much so that we could only manage to polish off   of the   cakes Then came the scones with choice of passion fruit or strawberry jab  the passion fruit is far too sweet  and fresh or strawberry cream  which was perfect  We could have had more but we were stuffed The tea I would most recommend is the Lotus Flower  The most repulsive was Lapsang Suchong  imagine putting a big log of well smoked oak in your mouth  and you would be nowhere near  I had heard the name and thought I d try it  but wish I hadn t All in all  a pleasant experience Now the real reason for our visit  The gold leaf cappuccino  To my horror  the barman said they were not allowed to make it any more for health and safety reasons  but eventually he let me have one  for free  It is not something I would recommend to be honest  The gold was not an aphrodisiac and just tasted like grit in my mouth  but at least I did it The cocktails however were great  but very expensive  but we enjoyed our drinks with the best view in Dubai and made some friends too  The complimentary nuts were very welcome too All in all  and absolute must do for all Dubai visitors  and they allowed us to take photos video aswell  
N =>  New money playing host to new money We had aspired to stay in the burj al arab after two fantastic trips to dubai  staying in the Palace at the Royal MirageWe went for evening cocktails on the last night of our second break at the Palace and took note of the smart casual dress code   no jeansGiven the fantastic service at the Palace and the price jump to all of the Jumeriah group hotels we were expecting to experience something even better We arrived at the Burj  nobody met our car or welcomed us even though a group of doormen were standing laughing and joking with each other  We walked in  had to find our own way to the elevators with no clear signage to the cocktail bar and no one in sight to assist In the sky view bar we were unable to sit anywhere with a  quot view quot  let alone a Sky View and the seating next to the windows prevented us from even a standing view A large group of footballers were completely ignoring the supposed dress code lounging around in jeans and trainers  a guy behind us was ringing people in england bragging it was his   th birthday and yes guess what  he was in the buuurrrjjj The decor throughout was psychadelic and whilst the outside is iconic  the inside is lavish to the point of being tackyWe were served a selection of canapes as part of our package which were totally prepackaged and could have been straight out of Tesco s  nothing   star thereOn leaving we were confronted with a horde of hooray s leaving the ball room  one drunk girl turning to us and saying oooh yooo tooo   is she yooouuur looveer or yer wife  It said it all we found the place to be full of footballers  chavs  trust fund kids  toffs etc Yes  it is an iconic building which has been lavishly constructed and has to be admired  but for us it was without taste inside and is left catering for the  quot nouveau riche quot   who are daft enough to go there  New money playing host to new money 
N =>   An Experience of a Lifetime   Well done to all at The Burj Al Arab   I always look on your site when booking a holiday  so when I returned from my trip to Dubai staying at the Burj al Arab I was intrigued to see what others thought of it I think we were staying at a different hotel to the two people who wrote comments before us   we were out there at the same time from the  rd to  th e and had an absolutely wonderful stay We couldn t fault a thing   we were greeted at the airport and fast tracked through immigration   we were taken to a waiting white rolls royce with chaufer in livery of the hotel who greeted us with cold flanels  water and a menu of music we would like to listen to on our journey At the hotel we were greeted by at least six members of staff who had been waiting outside for our arrival   the week just got better and better Our butlers were first class   then so were the service staff who serviced your room each time you left coming back to fresh bathrobes and towels  We never once felt we were not good enough to be there  we felt special and were treated like royalty I could write pages and pages about how fantastic this hotel was   we are well travelled and this is undoubtedly  quot the best hotel in the world quot  and deserves it s title  We personally cannot wait to go back   Well done to all at the Burj Al Arab    
N =>  Nice  but    Got the chance to visit Dubai  I never thought I d actually go there  considering its too far away from Australia  Did not stay in the hotel  but we ate there  Wow  what can I say  an amazing place  but like others have said on these forums  the whole concept is very vulgar  They have actually employed people to clean the guests  sunglasses  and wipe the gold hand rails every damn hour  There are millions of people starving just a few hundred miles away  Africa is not that far from Dubai    yet in this place they spend billions on just making themselves look good  I found the whole place to be disgusting  Nothing wrong with the hotel   but the whole concept is just wrong   pathetic if you ask me  I will never go back to Dubai  thats for sure  
N => OTT I can t claim to have stayed there  but my wife and I had a special  quot Xmas afternoon tea quot  there on Xmas day on a short stopover on our way to Oz As everyone else says  the place is jaw droppingly spectacular  inside and out  It may not be to everyone s taste  but they haven t spared the cash on decor Staff very attentive and the  quot tea quot  was top notch  Started with a glass of bubbly Choice of teas coffee perfect sandwiches  scones  cakes and fancies  Even a choir singing in the backround  Being Christmas Day  Santa came round and gave kids a little something  All perfectly pleasant but at a price  Got home to find on my credit card bill   tea for             
N =>  Once in a lifetime  Just returned from the Burj Al Arab as a suprise trip for my husband s   th birthday  It took me   years to save up but was worth every penny On arrival at Dubai airport we were whisked through passport control like VIPs to our waiting white Rolls Royce  The Chauffeur  in his Officer and a Gentleman uniform  wished my hubby Happy Birthday and presented me with orchids  The car was gorgeous and we even had a cd menu At the hotel all the staff greeted us and again wished my hubby happy birthday   but that was nothing compared to what was waiting in our suite  Not just wine  birthday cake  delicious and flowers but a line of butlers singing Happy Birthday  WOW The service and surprises continued throughout the holiday The underwater restaurant is expensive but worth the experience  Breakfast at Bab Al Yam is lovely  The views from the Sky View bar are breathtaking   take the panoramic lift  We both had a full body massage at the spa where the staff were most attentive   even finding my hubby in the sauna to let him know my treatment had finished and I was now in the pool I m not really interested in architecture  but when lying on the beach you can t help but keep looking at the hotel   its beautiful When we ventured out the best nights were at Jambase at Madinat Jumeirah   fantastic food and jazz band  and La Parrilla  Argentinian restaurant with tango band and dancers  I won t give anything else away about the hotel   you need to experience it yourself  This was supposed to be a  Once in a lifetime  holiday   not anymore   we ll definitely return Start saving up now   you won t regret it  
N => Fantastic experience We stayed for   nights for our   th Wedding anniversary  in ember  after spending a fantastic   nights at the Al Quasr next door The Suite at the Burj was outstanding  very opulent and really over the top  exactly what we had expected  and had been looking forward to  Full size Hermes products  including perfume and aftershave in a very beautiful bathroom Staff were fantastic  from the chauffeur of the white rolls who presented us with orchids  cold towels and a very warm welcome  to the Butler who was very helpful yet discreet   Although he never offered to unpack  We were given wine  flowers  chocolates  cake  card  more handmade sweets  throughout our stay  we had a beautifully made up bed with single red roses and more chocolates  each night  we couldnt have been more pampered   it really made the occasion special Ate both nights in the hotel  the restaurant at the top was very    s nice atmosphere  average food  cost around      but worth it  The Seafood Restaurant the next night was amazing   even the submarine ride   absolutely fantastic restaurant  a superb gastronomic feast  very befitting for our   th Anniversary  more expensive than the previous night but well worth it We have to go back because I didnt have time to visit the spa  which has been highly recommended For a special treat its more than worth a visit  
N => Dinner at Al Mahara  over hyped over priced with mediocre food So  the Burj is worth seeing and we were told you couldn t get in without a reservation  We only had a   h layover in Dubai so couldn t stay overnight  but we made dinner reservations at Al Mahara  Seeing the Burj was well worthwhile  The design is far out with a Vegas y sort of flair  But Al Mahara was disappointing  I ve pain      for meals before  but for that price expect very high quality cuisine  This food was mediocre  Service was good and the aquarium is fun to watch while you eat  The  quot submarine quot  to get to the hotel is lame and we took the elevator after dinner All in all  I d recommend making a reservation at their least expensive restaraunt just to see the Burj or maybe just stay overnight  Don t go to Al Mahara though  It s like dropping money in that big fish tank  
N => Stunning hotel but lacking the personal touch Writing this review directly from the Burj while waiting for the current fog to clear The weather has been perfect but some fog this morning  Arrived yesterday after staying at Al Qasr for   nights we decided to have   night at the Burj as it was our anniversary yesterday  Arrived at the hotel courtesy of Al Qasr as Burj forgot to send us their car as they had a conference on  Not the best start as I had ordered the white rolls as a surprise for my husband  The arrival at the hotel was welcoming but hurried as I mentioned they had an important conference taking place  We were shown to our suite and awaiting us was a   room suite  we were totally amazed it is fabulous using past and present tenses here because we are still here   Antony our butler yesteday afternoon showed us around brought us chilled drinks and gave us a tour of our suite  we have   beds   bathrooms   living areas and   dining area and kitchen panoramic views all around   range of luxury hermes goods in bathrooms too many superlatives about the suite itself to mention However service here is mixed Some people greet you some dont  We did not see our evening butler at all only when I called him in to ask him to clear a dirty tea tray which had not been removed after the room had been made up  Our evening guest services lady Stefanie a German lady was very rude and very unfriendly when we arrived on our floor yesterday evening after visiting the spa and having afternoon tea instead of welcoming us she asked us what we wanted    Only after I complained they apologised and said that sometimes visitors wander up to the floors this is totally not acceptable when you have saved hard and are staying here as a guest this should not happen visitors to the hotel should be seperated from the guests of the hotel  In my opinion there are too many visitors wandering around  Previous comments from people that the butler offered to run baths unpack cases did not happen to us so I was quite disappointed  We took breakfast this morning outside by the pool in Bab Al Yam it was fantastic wonderful selection of everything you could possibly desire  Staff there warm welcoming and very friendly Overall for us this stay in the Burj has been a mixed bag  The hotel itself and the suite is fantastic but it is really the service what makes the stay and this we feel really has let it down for us  At the Al Qasr it couldnt be more different the service is out of this world  it is a truly magical hotel and I am so glad that we will finish off our holiday back there for the next   days  Roll on check out time  
N =>  Great food pity about the service We only ate lunch here as we were staying at the nearby Mina A Salam hotel but wanted to suss out the venue and see whether we might stay at the Burj on our next trip to Dubai In short we wont be and here s why  remember this is a   star hotel  we arrived for lunch a few minutes early and checked into the restaurant foyer  We expected to be offered a pre lunch aperitif in the bar lounge area but were simply told to come back at the appointed hour  So we made our own way to the hotel lounge and ordered our own cocktails  Not exactly a good start I was travelling with my wife and daughter and when we finally sat down it was at a table set for four  I was initially surprised that the unused fourth place setting was not removed from our table but my curiosity was answered after we had started eating when a waiter poured water into the empty glass at the spare space and ushered someone we had never met into the spare chair  I asked  quot who are you quot  and was told he was dining on his own and would he like to join us  Er  I dont think so  The waiter then made some sort of excuse to the effect he thought for some strange reason this gentleman was part of our group Towards the end of the meal my daughter s water glass was whisked off the table despite being still about half full  My daughter questioned the waitress when she returned and was merely told in a quite surly manner that the glass was empty  We had an exchange between my daughter and the waitress of yes it was empty  no it wasnt in the best Fawlty Towers tradition for a few seconds before I made to retrieve the glass and water from a side table  At which point she provided us with a fresh glass and more water When we booked the meal we had arranged to take coffee in the lounge bar area on the opposite side of the hotel on the   th floor so we could have a different view of the mainland beach  After eating we made our way to the reception area for the lounge bar and were told they were only serving pre booked full english afternoon tea and anyway there were no vacancies but if we wanted to come back at      for an afternoon tea that would be ok  I protested and said that was not what had been agreed but they would not budge  Having been so unimpressed with the service so far neither would I  We refused to leave the area and so the receptionist said she was calling the restaurant manager  I said something to the effect of the sooner the better and he appeared a few minutes later  Somewhat surpisingly he was immediately sympathetic to our position and offered to seat us immediately if there was a table free  He investigated and there was and so we were able to enjoy our coffee in peace By the way  the food was excellent but we will not be going back  
N => Superb hotel bar the Restraunts I am writing this review while sitting at the study desk  using the supplied laptop in our suite in Burj Al Arab You may be wondering why I am writing a review on this hotel while staying at such a wonderful  the answer to this question is simple  I am waiting for my wife to get ready for dinner Anyhow  we are regular visitors to Dubai  amp  we usually stay in Jumeirah Beach Hotel as we have   young children This visit it is just my wife  amp  I  for   nights only From the moment we got picked up at the airport in a white Rolls Royce  the experience was superb As you are greeted in the RR  cold hand towels  amp  bottled water is handed to you  while my wife was presented with a well presented flowerin an attractive presentation box After we arrived we were whisked up to our suite immediately no hanging around for the room to be ready The butler greeted us on our suite floor  amp  showed us around the suite which is just out of this world  I doubt you will find a better  normal charge  suite anywhere in the world A huge plasma screen jacuzzi study with laptop  amp  internet access and acres of room awaits you There is even a pillow menu with a vast selection of pillows awaiting your decision The suite was very comfortable  amp  had everything you could think of The one thing we were worried about was that it just may be too stuffy for us  how wrong I could be  there was a very relaxed atmosphere everywhere we went The only complaint I had was the Al Muntaha restraunt on the   th floor  it was exceptionally expensive  amp  the food was not very good This put us off eating in the hotel restraunts again for dinner opting for Gordon Ramseys Verre  amp  Jumeirah Beach La Parilla instead To summarise  a wonderful stay in a wonderful hotel Just go  amp  eat dinner elsewhere as there are better restraunts available in Dubai  amp  not as pricey  
N =>   Highly disappointed with the Burj Al Arab This my seem a Shock review to all  in comparison to the   star ratings it has received so far  However me and my wife had a nightmare for the short duration that we stayed here  The first problem was the bath  which for some reason ceased to supply any water when needed  This also surprised the bath assistant  but it still took a good    hours for it to be rectified  The second incident was with room service meal  Upon presentation of the meal we found a piece of meat in the salad although we had asked for a veggie option  which upset my wife as she is a strict vegetarian  The last and final straw came when we were charged extra for the meal as they stated that we had ordered a meat dish even though it was confirmed earlier on that we hadn t  What can I say            stars of pure rubbish  I d rather stay at dehli darbar hotel which I find to be amongst the best in the world  
N =>  Amazing rooms but over the top Stayed here for   nights  The rooms are fantastic  every luxury you could think of  the hotel is also out of this world will all of the facilities you would ever need  and more We just found it TOO much  with someone knocking on your door every   minutes asking if you wanted your bath run  your beds made  more ice  etc etc  I understand that thid hotel has to give good serices  but this was too much  In the end  we put the do not disturb sign on the door to keep them away I dont regret going here  it was an amazing experience  but I wouldnt go again  
N =>  Total Luxury This hotel exceeds our expectations every time we go  This was our second visit  and this time my boyfriend lover surprised me with the presidential suite  It was fantastic  Every luxury your could imagine was there  I never even had to draw my own bath  And the tub jets   oooooooh  It was a surprise birthday get away   and what a surprise it was  I thought the one bedroom was grand   this far surpassed that  I have to say   the food was out of this world  Very delicious  The service   spectacular  Bruce has very over the top tastes  and likes  quot certain things quot  while away on vacation   this hotel caters to your every whim   no questions asked  If you want it   they will find it  You pleasure is their mission    D  Rowley 
N =>  Afternoon Tea I have just got back from Dubai and went to the Burj for afternoon tea  The greeting at the door and by reception was very good   I was told i could take photo s on the ground floor and first floor  Then went up to the   th floor for afternoon tea which was excellent  Cost about     or so and was well worth it   i was on my own and was made to feel comfortable by staff especially the english head waiter or Manager not sure who he was  The tea was great   every type to choose from and plenty of it  The sandwiches were gorgeous  i had veggie ones and had the cakes  scones etc which were lovely  Spent about an hour and half there   great experience though i have to say some of the visitors were a little above their station  If you fancy a treat take the opportunity tovisit this hotel though unless you are rich you wont be likely to stay there  
N =>  absolutley fabulous my husband son and i spent   night at the burj to celebrate my   th whilst on holiday in dubai  Words can not describe how fantastic the hotel is  The suite was beyong belief  but i must say that the food we ate was not as good as that at the Le meridien where we spent the rest of our holiday  A burger at the poolside was        and a glass of bubbly was      but it was an experience and i would return again tommorow  
N =>  not worth it I stayed here in      The lift to the skybar and the views over the Arabian Gulf are breathtaking but not as breathtaking as the price of the drinks when you get there The al maha restaurant was ok  but I have had better meals for a lot less I don t mean to sound like a skinflint but I did not think it was worth the money  If you are seriously loaded I m sure it would be great fun  but there are many other hotels in Dubai that are just as good The best things were the pool  the fountains and the aquarium in the entrance  although you can t take photos in case you frighten the fish  And yes that ride in the Rolls Royce limousine still brings a smile to my face  
N => A little over rated   Yes this is a wonderful hotel but I think a lot depends on what you re used to  My husband and I stayed for   nights a couple of weeks ago to celebrate our   th wedding anniversary and they did provide us with some little extras for this  wine  cake  which were great but no more than we d received from the city hotel we stayed in first  We ve travelled the world extensively and if you re used to    in the Far East then you re not really going to get much more  The suite was huge with every gadget available but again if you re used to staying in suites the only difference is that their s are more opulent  My only criticism is with the restaurant   we dined in the Al Muntaha  on the   th floor  and we ve certainly had better for a lot less  We had a main course each with the smallest glass of wine you ve ever seen and this cost         The cost would have been OK if it was the best food we d ever eaten but it wasn t and the portions were miniscule  If you do want to eat in the hotel go to the Al Iwan which  although buffet style  was excellent  Would we go again   no  but we re glad we tried it  
Not for the faint hearted The Burj is what is says it is  The world s most luxurious hotel   but at a cost  A beer is    and a glass of champage will set you back      Not for the faint hearted  However the rooms are spectacular with bells and whistles galore  The lobby is stylish and jawdropping  the Al Mahara is a great restaurant but again  is tough on the wallet       for   with wine   The Hotel has a strict dress code  no shorts after  pm  and gentlemen cannot remove their jackets at dinner   this can seem a little stiffling if you are there on a relaxing holiday The Burj is unique and worth staying a couple of nights just to savour the experience and the glamourous surroundings      Be sure to take the Rolls to the airport when you leave

Not a family hotel If you are planning on visiting dubai with your family or for a simple holiday they think wisley  The Capitol hotel is mainly for business people  We were the only family there who were not on business  The rooms are spacious and up to date  as well as the hotel  However the hotel does seem tired  The View however in rooms are very poor  We had two rooms  one room had the beautiful brick call to look at with two small windows on either side and the other room had another room to look at  Breakfast is not great as the same food is served day after day  Other hotels i have stayed at have a huge variety but the Capitol doesnt  The guests are all on business so it doesnt make it fun for family  There is no specific hotel evening entertainment  only a couple of bars and a resteraunt which we didnt use at all  the swimming pool is small but fine for a dip  nothing special  while we were out on the roof  we were disrupted by the drilling taking place on the room and all the dust plesantly falling in the pool  If you expect to see other people there then think again  its a dead area on the roof with a shoddy gym facility  The hotel service is fine  but we used the hotel for somewhere to sleep  If u want something special  spend the money and go somewhere else  but if your on business or jus need somewhere to sleep then its fine  
N =>  Capitol Hotel This hotel had lots of good points but major disappointment was that there seemed to be no non smoking rooms We arrived early in the morning      am  and the hotel was very accommodating  showing us to our room within half an hour of our arrival  however  the room really smelled of stale smoke  This was not an isolated problem as at least one other couple had the same problem  even though they had pre booked a non smoking room  We asked to change rooms and was informed that we could  but not until midday  At midday it seemed there was a problem  with only one room available  I fear this room only smelled sweeter due to the fact it was above the night club and had probably been unoccupied for some time  As I was fortunate enough to have ear plugs with me the noise did not prove a problem The hotel itself was very clean and the staff most pleasant  the food was OK and on a par with other establishments tried  but disappointing and not as good as Singapore  our last port of call  The hotel provided daily shuttles to the beach and to the city for shopping  which was appreciated In all the hotel was fine and for the cost  a cheap deal through Emirates airlines   is somewhere I would use again  
N =>  an oasis in the desert u can find touch of the gulf   india  amp the far east  food was excellent ambeinece was good service was perfect 
Not a great hotel and the staff made it even worse First  the hotel lobby smelled musty and looked old  The rooms were not much better but bearable  The bathrooms were clean  I didn t eat there because the floor of the hotel restaurant  adjoining the business center  was sticky  I also had significant problems with the internet  When I got there  the young ladies at the reception desk were rude and did not smile at all  They also complained loudly about the  stupid  customers calling them and asking them  very stupid  questions  Definitely not welcoming  I could not access the internet in my room and the reception offered no support whatsover  I went downstairs to the lobby and asked for help or a refund  They initially refused to do either  I then went to the business center  The only thing going for them was the lady there  I believe her name was  Miss Blossom   She was helpful when the hotel s own computers didn t connect to the internet  She let me use her computer  I had   urgent emails to send  at no charge  The only other helpful person was a young man at the reception  I only saw him once  who helped me get a taxi The hotel is close to a nice mall  That is one of it s only highlights I don t recommend this hotel at all  Especially not for the price  
N =>  Enjoyed our stay Have seen a lot of the reports on here   certainly our experience was not the same We arrived a lot earlier than we were able to officially get to our rooms   on reception they arranged this for us Breakfasts had a choice wide enough for most   found the staff pleasant   especially if you were with them Smoking in the bar could be a problem   however there are   bars The Phillipino bar is lively with a group who are energetic and not short on talent Rooms have ample space  Hotel was clean and tidy and had a wonderful Indian restaurant where the authentic food was extremely good   and entertainment provided by an Indian group was good but not intrusive Comments about taxis are valid   and they certainly weren t easy to come by as the hotel is set slightly back from the main road If you want a cosy hotel this one will do  I would go back there as the amenities they offer for a smallish hotel were acceptable 
Never Again The hotel staff are rude and slow  The rooms were OK but the room we had was above the disco that played loudly until wee hours of the morning  Even when I rang the front desk to have the music turned down I was told he would ask and ring me back   I m still waiting for his phone call  If you smoke and love watching soccer this is the best hotel for you  I think I have got lung cancer from just sitting and having one drink before dinner  Something needs to be done about the air conditioning system as all you could do was cough from the smoke  It s a wonder the smoke alarms didn t go off  You can tell I m a non smoker  The location of the hotel is terrible unless you need to go to hospital or you want to walk around the  new gold souk  which is so dead it would be a miracle if it is still in business when you get there  Food was average  Would never recommend anyone in my family to stay there  
N =>   Good hotel but a long way out of town We stayed here on an Emirates stopover and stayed for   nights  The hotel was OK  but it was a long way from the city coast areas and you had to take a taxi to go anywhere  Our room was spacious and the bathroom a good size  We had no hot water for a day as the system broke down   we were not advised and had to find out ourselves why we could not have a hot shower  They provide a good breakfast and evening meal  The staff are well trained and polite  but the people on the front desk were not too friendly and everything was an effort  If I travel to Dubai again I would probably look for a hotel in a more central location  
N =>  Moderate but not again We stayed here on an Emirates Stopover in ober for   days We were allowed to check in reasonably early although the hotel should know that Emirates Flights from Australia arrive very early am and should have the rooms ready straight away  The reception staff could learn to smile  it would help when you are exhausted after    hours on a plane  Room was big and fine althought the totewsl had seen better days  Breakfast was OK with willing staff but in a small area off the main lobby  The hotel looks and feels like an ex pat drinking hole and is geared for business types not families  it is also isolated although taxis are very cheap compared to the UK  Overall is was not bad but not up to   stars elsewhere in the East and we would not go back to the hotel nor Dubai which is just one huge building site HALondon  UK 
N =>   Problems from Start to Finish Chelsea Hotel  Dubai  UAE   quot Problems from start to finish  quot Date  tember         Reviewer  J  Daniels  Scotland  UKNote  this review is for the Chelsea Hotel not the Chelsea Tower Apartments  same group   different building Hotels Website  www crimsonhotels co uk uae chelsea hotel In tember      we went on holiday to Mauritius  We decided to have    days in Mauritius and a couple of days in Dubai on our return as we had a stop to change planes  We booked the Chelsea Hotel through our travel agent but didn t really know anything about it except that it was rated a    Hotel  The hotel was just a base to see Dubai and somewhere to sleep between our travels Friday   th t     TaxiWe had arranged and paid in advance for the hotel to collect us from the airport with their own private taxi at     am on the Friday morning when our flight got in  There was no taxi waiting  I waiting for    minutes before phoned the hotel and was told that the driver was there and that he was waiting at the airport exit doors  After another    minutes of checking every firm and driver at the exit doors I phoned the hotel again to be told that he was leaving the hotel as we spoke and that he would be with us at the airport in    minutes and to wait by the exit doors     minutes later he arrived  He was apologetic but he was more anxious that we would not complain as he might lose his job  In fact he whined all the way to the hotel  He was so annoying I had to tell him several times to be quiet  When we arrived at the hotel they were not in the least bit interested that we had to wait over an hour and a half for our hotel transport to arrive  RoomThe room  which they let us into early   about       am  was very good   cool  quiet  lots of marble  comfortable bed  etc   As I had not slept at all on the overnight from Mauritius I collapsed into bed and slept for about   hours before exploring Dubai Saturday   thDayToured Dubai   tried the ski dome  fantastic  etc  NightWe arranged for an early breakfast for the Sunday morning as we were leaving at      am to go to the airport in the pre booked hotel taxi Confirmed with the front desk that the transport would be there to take us to the airport Went to bed early      pmWas awakened with loud music filtering through to the room Complained to the front desk who said that the music must be from the room next to mine and that I should knock on the door and complain   I told the front desk to sort the problem After another hour of the loud music I decided to find out where it was coming from  It was not from any neighbours room  it was not from the room under my room  In fact it was coming from the hotel nightclub on the ground floor    floors down  which did not close till     am  Unable to sleep Sunday   thBreakfastWent down for breakfast at      am to find that the    hour caf  breakfast area was closed off for cleaning  After complaining to the management  who really were not interested  eventually managed to get tea and toast  we had paid in advance for full English breakfast  CheckoutThey had to check the mini bar before we could leave and then they tried to charge us for a packet of nuts which we had not taken   I refused to pay  Eventually the let us leave feeling like criminals  The attitude of the management and staff in the hotel is atrocious  They have no interest in their customers whatsoever  The hotel seems to be full of American workmen who spend all their money in the hotel  It is NOT a tourist hotel  Avoid the Chelsea Hotel at all cost     
Not to be missed   My girlfriend and I stayed at the Chelsea Hotel last week and thought it was excellent value for the price paid  We got a free upgrade to an executive suite and although I can t comment on the size or quality of the standard rooms  The hotel was exceptionally clean  The hotel is equipped with roof top pool  jacuzzi  gym etc      and a good few bars and on Thursday  ladies night and Saturday  sport   they are full and vibrant  as mainly ex pats go to them to get a beer  The staff are very polite and helpful  In a taxi you can pretty much get anywhere within      mins maximum and the taxis are cheap  
N =>   Average hotel terrible service Stayed in Chelsea Tower for   nights  We originally booked a   bedroom apartment only to discover that all one bedroom apartments are fully booked  So we were upgraded to a   bedroom apartment  Now you might think what a lucky dude I was happy at first  but when I arrived to the room I was surprised that the other two bedrooms were locked    I contacted the hotel reception and expressed my dissatisfaction with the apartment since it huge but half of it locked  The receptionist wasn t helpful whatsoever  so when I asked to speak to the hotel manager I was told that the manager will call me the next day The following day I was waiting but no one called  So when I called the Manager  MOHAMMED  he was rude  and arrogant and didn t provide any assistance saying that there are no one bedroom apartments and he will not open the other two bedrooms without a charge  One more thing about this hotel  the room keys didn t work  so when I went to the reception to have them reprogrammed  I was told that the system wasn t working and I had to stay in the room without keys   I then left the hotel to the beautiful Madinat Jumeriah  Check my review for Dar Al Masyaf  
N =>   To mr Yesser the respectful restaurant manager We stayed from    till march         We had to work for the Fiteselektor eventThe staff was very good and the rooms are very okay The food from the restaurant was very good Thank you for having me   us Leo      
N =>   close but no cigar Appartment size good  but poor soundproofing so traffic noise was an issue and I was on the  th floor  Servcie weak  examples include paying for a late check out  then getting to my room with some very heavy bags to find my key no longer worked so had to do all the way downstairs again  my laundry not getting returned for   days till I chased it up as I was checking out  and they dont do laundry on Fridays  and the fact that this hotel is  quot dry quot  i e  no alcohol available at all  and dont forget being the middle east you cant just pop out and buy some to take back to your room   Food ordered at pool took    mins to arrive and when I wanted them to look after my luggage after I had checked out they wanted to charge me dhs    per bag for the priveledge  but here their incompetance worked in my favour as they forgot to charge me All in all an ok place to stay  good location  but expect   star service and you wont be dissapointed  
N =>   Plesant suprise A four star    floor    m high hotel   serviced apartments located in the middle of other skyscrapers close to the forthcoming highest building in the world  Burj Dubai   Offering mainly aimed to expats etc staying there longer  I was there on combined business holiday trip lasting for   days during      Hotel is new  built in       One to three bedroom apartments with fully equipped kitchen  Some rooms have balcony  we had a three bedroom apartment  free upgrade in check in from one bedroom apartment   which was probably bigger than our house back home  It had three bathrooms   additional toilet  Nice pool section with   m pool   additional one for kids  Good  fast service during throughout the stay  Quite many restaurants  amp  cafes  including the usual Starbucks  Burger King  Pizza Hut etc but also Lebanese  Iranian  amp  Indian places   small supermarkets and a little mall in the neighborhood within walking distance  And it is actually possible to walk to those spots  unlike in some other places in Dubai where you simply need to use a car    Also some high end restaurants available  e g  in the nearby Shangri la hotel    lane highway going just by the hotel  so some amount of traffic noise is always there  Nothing annoying as such though  at least not in our room in the   th floor facing the highway  Note that this highway is extremely congested many hours a day  so even a small journey with taxi can take a very long time All in all really nothing to complain about  It s not exactly a full five star hotel with extensive pampering etc  but as a four star apartment does its job very well  I would not hesitate to return to this place  
N => unhelpful staff We booked on the internet  paid by credit card and we live in Abu Dhabi so could forsee no problems  We drove to the hotel in dubai  Staff insisted on our passports as ID  which we didn t have  would NOT accept our photo ID  uae credit cards  nothing at all  Very unhelpful  couldn t careless attitude  Where going to charge us for the room even though it was them that wouldn t let us stay there  Other hotels in dubai did not insist on passports as ID  Spoilt the day  
Nice surprise The hotel is new  so I think rates are low only temporarily  But in       we got a   bedroom suite for much less than the cost of a   bedroom at the Dusit Dubai  The rooms at Chelsea were larger and nicer  It really is an apartment  and there was a full kitchen we could have used There is a health club with a nice pool      olympic length  they say   but there are no amenities such as a fancy lobby  a bar  or nice restaurants  Breakfast is free and is served next door  
N =>   Not a true Sofitel but still comfortable We travelled to Dubai for the first time in ober      and booked into the Sofitel  Being a Sofitel hotel we expected something quite  flashy  unfortunately we were let down  The rooms  although comfortable and clean  were not of the standard we expected and were definately not what we expected after looking at the photos on the hotel s website  We suspect that the room photos shown must be the Executive Level suites The rooms were large with plenty of space for the huge bed  eating area and desk  The bathroom was a good size with great water pressure and loads of hot water   something I am obsessed about when travelling Our Emirates flight from Australia arrived very early in the morning and I would suggest if arriving this early       am  that you pay for the extra night so that you have a room to go to when you arrive  We didn t  so spent many hours sitting in the hotel foyer waiting for a room to become available  However we were supplied with complimentary drinks and were able to have breakfast even though we would be charged  It worked out well as we had breakfast included in the cost of the room and as we had an early departure to Paris we were unable to have breakfast on the day we left so in the end it cost us nothing  Also the hotel provides complimentary transfers from the airport which we weren t aware of when we arrived so we would suggest notifying them prior to arrival so that they are waiting  however taxis in Dubai are not expensive  Overall the service  particularly in the resturant  was excellent and the staff were very friendly  We had a few issues with the check in staff but we feel they were the exception to the rule  We would recommend the hotel to others but if staying in the standard room we would suggest lowering your expectations for the usual Sofitel standard We are booked in to the hotel in the next month for our second stay  mainly because we couldn t get our chosen accommodation elsewhere however we have booked an executive level suite  fingers crossed it will live up to expectations  
N =>   Never book a triple at this hotel  Arrived at      am  Gave the front desk credit card information for incidentals as room was already paid for through travel agent  Was told that the electricity was not working and therefore they could not issue keys  Was asked to wait in the lobby  An hour later was told electricity was back on  but found that staff had not assigned a room to us  Took another     hour to get keys  When arrived at the room  no third bed was set up  What had they been doing for an hour and      Once additional lumpy rollaway was added to room there was little room to move  Asked front desk to be moved to larger room in morning  was told that all rooms were the same sized  Advised them that they should not sell triples and was told   quot The travel agents know the room size  quot  Found that this hotel and the staff had little customer service skills and less ability to anticipate the needs and expectations of guest  I ve been told there are        hotel rooms in Dubai   pick another hotel for your stay  
N =>   More like   STARS   Booking my stay via the Sofitel website after a pleasant experience at several other Sofitel locations over the past   years with my new job I was lookign forward to a   star luxe stay after a stressful business trip My expectation were reasonable  however certainly not met by the Sofitel City Centre Firstly  checkin was anything but a breeze  Checkin screwed their face up at my e confirmation I had printed and were unwilling to collect bags from taxi   leaving me to lug large garment cases as I am a buyer for a fashion company Secondly  the room was stale and boring  At this price point I expect some form of expression in terms of decor  However the Sofitel offers poor quality and worn furniture more suited to a   star hostel  Chippping to the desk and bedside table as well as well as stained carpet I was lookign forward to a dip in the pool as I was not accustomed to the heat of Dubai having flown in from Paris  Pool area was situated badly as the rooftop location meant that wind gusts were constant  Noise traffic from airport and streets invasive The gym was well equipped which I d regard as the Sofitels only good point If shopping is your thing the attached shopping centre is lax  and Dubai has MUCH more to offer in terms of retail Overall I will not be returning to Sofitel City Centre as I feel this vibrant city has much more to offer at this price point and star rating  
N =>  Comfortable stay  I stayed there   days  executive floor      excellent service  good room service  Location  next to a huge mall  very practical when you need to shop  If you need to rent a car  go downstairs and negociate at least     from the book price  I have no regrets about my stay there  eventhough I left this hotel to stay for the last   days of my stay in so called   star hotel  One  amp  Only Royal Mirage  horrible service and poor management Room   price is very good at Sofitel     Go there  you will enjoy     
N =>  Good Hotel The location of the hotel is excellent but this is defenitely not a        hotel    it needs a whole lot more than a renovation for the rooms  amp  common areas    i would rather rate it as a       superior  but defenitely not a    
N =>  Not recommended This hotel carries a five star rating  which it clearly does not deserve The lobby area was drab and unappealing  The pool terrace was equally disappointing  The room was so average and bland I can t even remember it  The restaurant was nothing special either Staff were however friendly and helpful The hotel is next to a large shopping centre  which gives lots of dining options and quick access to plenty of shops  The doubledecker sightseeing buses also conveniently stop at the shopping centre Overall  I didn t like the hotel and expected more as the room rate was not particularly cheap  I would recommend splashing out a bit more to stay at one of the nice beachfront hotels instead   that is certainly what I would do next time  
N =>  Bad Service Facilities and Location Paying      which was a travel industry discount rate  i was expecting outstanding service  a beautiful room  and an excellent location  However i recieved NONE  CHECK IN Painful  SLOW  and umcomfortable  It took    minutes for my bags to be brought from my taxi to the desk  They then placed me in a SMOKING ROOM when i e mailed to confrim i wanted NON SMOKING  I Was moved after    minutes STAY I stayed in a standard delux room  My KING bed was simply   single begs stuck together creating a huge annoying gap in the middle     Overall the room was tired  you could hear the planes landing at the nearby airport  Only good thing was its size   actually very big Hotel staff were unable to connect inbound calls to my room   problem was because i moved rooms they were unable to change my room number  i now know how russell crowe feels because all i wanted to do was talk to family back home Internet facilities expensive and no privacy providedLady looking after the business club was rude and staff sent me from the lobby to my room to the lobby to the business centre to my room to the business centee to simply reconfirm my flights as i did not have ID or the original ticketWHen i had checked out and wanted to check my bank balance on net banking on the internet after paying      a night the man said i would be charged Room does NOT include coffee and tean facilities     and does not include these LOCATION it is in deria  But to get to the beach is   hours when the traffic is bad and costs a LOT  The shopping centre attached is ok but to get to the bigger malls is     hours awayOVERALL i would never stay at this hotel again  IT IS NOT value for money  
N => 	star room s   star service Hotel rooms are Five star but service is far from it   This is a dry hotel so no bar  You have to walk to Sofitel down the road if you want a beer  Breakfast buffet was ok but the chief cooks your omelette in the Restaurant with no extractor fan so your clothes end up stinking of food every morning  gave up in the end and started taking my breakfast to the room so I wouldn t smell of food all dayLocation is a nightmare to get to and from cant get a taxi first day took  hr    mins not even a limo  next day planned ahead this time only an hour and that was booking one with the front desk of the hotel  dont even think of going to the shopping mall to get a taxi   hours wait in the afternoons  When returning by taxi  drivers off load you when they find out where your going happened   times  Madness the traffic will kill this place if the country doesn t sort it out some how Pool in shade in the winter time so no use  gym opens at   and closes at   so no use if you have been out all day  Traffic is noisy and next to a mosque so call to prayer at    am if you need an early morning callConstruction site next door to hotel at the moment which is pretty much    hours so you get a nice beep beep beep of the crane lift all night I tried to change hotel but everything was full and company was paying for a   star hotel  This hotel does not deserve the title of   star even if the rooms do have that   star look to them  if you just want room and nothing else for one night it might be ok  One last thing i asked the door man to tell the taxi driver to take me to the VIP lounge at the airport i checked with him at least   times to make sure so there would be no mistake  he said YES YES i know i have told him  well guess what  driver went to main terminal and had no clue about the VIP lounge or where it was In the past i have had great time in Dubai and have thought of working there full time  but this trip has put me off for life  the traffic is a mess and will kill the tourist industry they are trying to develop never again  
N =>   I like this hotelGood Food Clean But Not Located in Great Area  i like    Rooms   Foods   HB  Break Fast  amp  Lunch   The Foods Were Iranian    Staffs   View Of Hotel    Clean   Cheap  amp  Good Rate   I will Back to This Hotel For Next timeDislikes    Not Located in Great Area     Noisy Night Clubs   We had Room in Upstairs But You Can Hear Night Clubs Sounds     
N =>   Awful This was one of two hotels we tried in Dubai  and would not recommend this one to anyone  unless you are Middle Eastern   This hotel clearly caters for a specific type of clientele  and if you are not in that group  you are virtually ignored  Our  double  room was located directly above one of the three very loud night clubs in this hotel  which operates every night till  am Not particularly well located  difficult for taxis to get access to  so they do not   and not all of the services they state they offer are  Our laundry disappeared for three days  
N =>  Great place to stay  The hotel looks to be new or newly remodeled  It was very nice and clean  Our room was HUGE  The staff there are extreemly nice and helpful  We even got flowers for one of the front desk girls to thank her for her kindness  We booked thru asiarooms com and got a good deal  It was pretty cheap compared to other hotels and since it was new  clean  huge  it was well worth it The only downside of the room was the shower leaked a little bit  but it wasn t a big deal  Sometimes it took us a little while to get a taxi in front of the hotel in the morning but we just walked a block or so and were able to always get one If I was going to stay in Deira again  I d stay here  
N =>  rating below one star definitely wouldn t recommend dirty room  black mould all around bath  reported it to reception no response    staff very unfriendly  breakfast buffet was a joke    wouldn t recommend it to my worst enemy  
N =>  claridge Hotel Dubai During my stay in Claridge hotel in Dubai at the time mentioned above  I as a guest was not pleased with the behaviour of the staff specially the people in the information section  They were very road with the customers which was very surprising for me No good hospitality was shown to the guests The quality of the food was not good at all  The water was too hot for taking shower and all togather considering to the expence of this three star Hotel  I was not pleased at all  
N =>   Average   star hotel This average   star hotel is conveniently located in the city centre  Walking distance from main shopping centres  Reasonable comfortable rooms at reasonable price  Nice buffet breakfast Ground floor disco which is usually noisy at nights  Personally I found it disturbing  Plus this place tends to be flooded with Russian prostitutes at nights  Strickly speaking  hotel policy does not allow any visitors in the guest rooms  off the record it does happen Hard to find a taxi in the mornings  until   AM  Reception staff can be busy at times and you might have to sit there in front of them  waiting to have a word Overall it s a reasonable hotel in the city centre  I suggest to book through a reputable travel agent e g  Expedia and save money  
N =>   Very good budget hotel The hotel was great  Very polite and helpful staff  Requests were answered promptly  Clean rooms and good food  Very good location  A supermarket just opposite the street  and internet cafe and variety of fast food restaurants nearby  The roof top pool was great  The bathroom was clean and good  The beds were very comfortable and clean The only problem we could find was the towels which apparently were not dried properly  and so smelled vary bad  This was random  though  some towels did not smell and some were not usable  In Summary  I would go to this hotel again  if I want to choose a budget hotel  
N =>   Quite good and comfortable location Overall  the staying was good  Staff was friendly and always available on time  Rooms were clean  but not as cosy as we expected them to be  The big problem with the restaurant buffet  Too few seats for many people  We had to stand in a queue to get seats and have our dinner  But the food was really great and diversified  Plus a lot of interferance into privacy  We could not bring our friends into our room  Small swimming pool  However  the location of the hotel compensates the abovementioned minuses  Just in front of the Al Ghurair Center  not far from Spinneys and ks and Spencer and    minutes walk from Naser Square  
Not bad   You get what you paid for   During my   night stay at this hotel  I can say that it earns a above moderate place  Pros are price  location  good food  Cons are small rooms  unclean bathroom towels  and the fact that the street that passes in front of the hotel is always jammed with traffic  I had to wait    minutes in front of the hotel to pick up a taxi to the airport    Otherwise a good location close to downtown and very close    minute walking distance  to Ghurair Shopping Center  There is also a supermarket right across the street which is also a major plus  There are two computers in the hall connected to the internet that are accessible to guests for   Dhs per hour which is quite cheap  The hotel also has a parking space so if you are renting a car  a definite plus    
N =>   great but the service i stayed in this hotel for   nights        the rooms were spacious bath was fine very very quite in corridors  breakfast was just great i love sausages i asked the guys to fix som leak in the bathroom  i needed to talk to three of them then they fixed it  internet was not free at all looks like Dubai is far behind in free high speed wireless internet services in hotels I called and went to the reception for a wake up call at   am  departure to the airport  thank god i used my cell phone alarm  no one even bothered All in all it was great stay if i would be back i would love to try another one 
N =>  The right choice Stayed at this hotel on the way back from Australia  The choice was more good luck than anything  but it was an excellent choice for what we wanted Position  Almost in the City centre  Shopping mall very close  and about    minuites from the Creek  Not close to the beach  If you want to hear the sea from your room  do not stay here   A lot of building work going on around the hotel but it was not intrusive Reception  We arrived at     AM Staff quickly dealt with the formalities and we went to our room  Leaving the hotel was equally painless  We used the hotels own transport back to the airport  Only    more than a taxi and worth it for the extra bit of luxury  On arrival at the hotel they want your credit card and take     EDoff it to pay for any services that you may use  If you don t use any  they credit your card with the    ED at the end of your stay   I hope    Room  Average size  clean and well presented  Safe for documents at no extra chargeCleaned on a daily baisis  Towels changed and toiletries replenished   If I were to go again  I would upgrade to a  quot Creek View quot  room  as the one we had overlooked a building site  Pointless paying for a balcony as it would be too hot to sit out anyway Food  Breakfasts good  A request to the ever helpful waiter brought us fried eggs or an omlette of your choice  We were going to eat there one night  but it was a buffert and we didn t fancy anything on it so I can t comment on the evening service or food  A small cafe serves snacks and drinks     at a price  This is a  quot dry quot  hotel so don t expect any alcahol to be served If I ever went to Dubai again I would certainly stay in this hotel and it is in an ideal position for the city sights  
Not for western business travellers Stayed there       nights was not impressed on a business traveler aspect  When I arrive at a hotel  I usually need to get to my room and get connected to the internet  I don t have time to wait on the bell hop to bring my luggage to my room  I always bag drag it myself  Case in point for any hotel manager reading this  Have your desk people ASK the customer if they would like their luggage sent to the room  Don t INSIST that it be taken up for them   As for the room  Placement for connections for electricity and internet is very inefficient  The Ethernet connection is by the bed and the desk is on the other side of the room  I had to request a cable and the maintaince guy brought me one he spiced himself The overall design of this hotel leaves me wondering if this was a first attempt for the architect  As previously posted  rugs would help For those who enjoy a libation  this is a dry hotel  
N =>  Rooms clean was cheap enough but would not go back  Check in  amp  check out was extremely slow but they were not busy  Breakfast was very ordinary  but staff tried by doing what they could  The rooms are very clean with everything you need  Breaky was included with our room  amp  despite it saying clearly in the rate we were charged for it  amp  took  mins before the office person accepted they had made a mistake  amp  removed it  He just kept repeating  quot but you had breakfast quot  while seeing on the original voucher that it was included  It was good value  but go without the breakfast  amp  with the money you save order a club sandwich by room service instead  
Not   star I have stayed in many   star hotels in my short life   I paid a   star price but got   or   star service and cleanlyness  This place has large rooms   but don t think the service   room service or breakfast that was left for a day or two to mature  is what you are getting  There is only one thing going for this place and that is near the mall   but even then then new mall of Dubai is better and bigger   hard to belive  than Emirites  Please stay somewhere else listen to me  A big room stay at the Taj  Near the mall stay at Kepinski or Dubai mall The Adress  not been there  Great beach hotel Jebel Ali   or Jemira Beach I have stayed at them all Brett 
N =>  Keep away We booked the hotel for   days for a customer upon a   star hotel request close to the free zone  We looked up the website and saw the fascinating photos  We confirmed the reservation but our customer called us back after the check out with complaints that nobody would like to hear    It was not a   star hotel  There was a construction     Service was terrible  Their profile was damaged becasue they had gone there for a billion dollar business   And the worst thing  They were charged one day extra  we dont know why   We have lost a very high profile customer     THANK YOU CORAL DEIRA                                                  HOPE NOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
N =>  Overpriced      Stayed at this Hotel for   night with my father   what a dive     See attached pics of our  quot view quot  from our minature rooms   the smallest room I have ever stayed in     more like a   star pension than a   star hotel    also could not even get a beer as it is an alcohol free hotel  
N =>   Terrible Staff My experience at the Coral Deira Dubai was very bad This supposed    hotel  has probably the worst staff you can ever find  At my arrival  I specifically asked for a non smoking room     guess what  I spent all my stay in a smoking room regardless of the complaints I made to management The staff was horrible as in one of the days during my stay  they did not even made my bed  All this  not to mention the adventure it is to book a taxi  I opted to book taxis on my own through the Dubai Taxis number as the hotel staff would not ask for taxis   Unbelievable  
N =>  friendly my stay here was very pleasant  I was on my own  very nervous  and a first time visitor to Dubai  the staff were very friendly  and put me at ease straight away  They were very helpful  nothing was too much trouble  they helped me arrange tours  cabs and gave me instructions as to how to get to the places I wanted to see  The pool was very nice and most of the time i had it to myself Breakfast was really nice  it was a nice way to start the day  
N =>   Core Hell Dearer My wife and I arrived at the hotel after a flight from Nairobi   making it there after midnight  Upon presenting our online prepaid accommodation voucher  we were told there was no record of us  The guy on reception made some enquiries  couldn t sort it out and so said we would need to pre authorise to pay the      Dirham a standard room cost  Fair enough   even though this was the last thing you need at that time of night   he assured us all would be sorted out in the morning Next day  I went down to the lobby and explained to one of the staff what had happened   they informed me that the local agent had not received the booking  I then showed the hotel the confirmation emails AND my credit card online receipt to show how I had already paid for the room  Enter Mr helpful   possibly named Imad  although he didn t introduce himself  He checked the emails and credit card statements over and over and then finally phoned the company   I was asked to speak to them  They told me the mistake was the hotel s and that they would sort it out  To cut a long story short  let s just say that at      I had had enough  Almost   hours later I was left with no other option but to forcefully and loudly articulate my dissatisfaction at the front desk  Enter someone with customer service training  A Sri Lankan man with impeccable manners and understanding  He immediately offered us complimentary food and drinks in the restaurant  which incidentally suffered from the same lack of training   staff bringing out fried eggs instead of Caesar salad and bringing out ice cream desert at the same time as the main course    He also sorted out our transport to the airport and this was much appreciated      minutes later he had the whole matter sorted  As for the tall black gentleman  Imad    he was more concerned with letting us know that it was the travel agency who had made the mistake   not the hotel  He didn t seem to realise that when you have one day in Dubai  you don t want to spend it in endless arguments at the front desk  Even though the problem may not have been the hotel s fault  the way it was handled was atrocious and it ruined the last day of our holiday  The hotel  material  is fine  it s the total lack of customer care shown by some staff that lets it down a bagful  If you want to stay somewhere that you can be sure of quality service  this is not the place  Did someone say   star  That has to be a joke  
N =>  Not   Star but decent hotel We booked this hotel through Emirates as a stopover on our way to Africa  We stayed there for   nights  The hotel is definitely not a   star as rated on the Emirates site  at the most I would give it   stars  The staff is friendly  but not too helpful  we were unable to convert our money even though they have a sign that says they will convert for you  The doorman is terrible at getting cabs  one evening we had to wait       minutes just to get one The rooms are okay  clean simple decore  the bathroom had limited hot water and after complaining it still did not work  we weren t offered another room either The indian restaurant  quot Rasoi quot  is really fabulous and being Indian we are harsh judges of our own cuisine  All the chicken dishes we tried were really very good  not same for the lamb dishes though  We didn t try the buffet  so can t comment on it  The breakfast buffet is very good  lots of choices of hot and cold foods  as well as drinks  and breads and fruits  We usually ended up skipping lunch after having a late breakfast The location of the hotel is close to the gold market only   miles or so but getting there is another story  with the traffic it usually takes anywhere from    minutes upto      hours  They really need to do something to expand the roadways in Dubai I don t think we will stay there again  too many other nice hotels to try  
N =>  Such a friendly hotel We have just returned from a   week stay in Dubai  with family for the first   days and at the Coral Deira for   days  I was a little worried when we first arrived at the hotel  as we had driven from the very clean  amp  modern Jumeirah Beach via the tunnel under the creek and the slightly  scruffy  port area  However  once inside the hotel we were very impressed with the friendliness of all the staff  even being given a drink on our arrival  We were a little shocked to discover that the hotel was non  alcoholic  but once we had accustomed ourselves to the idea  it did not worry us  Everywhere was clean and bright and the room was excellent  The pool on the roof was also very good and not at all crowded  It was very convenient to the creek and managed to retain all the atmosphere of city  We booked   excursions  one to the desert and the moonlight dinner cruise  both excellent value although the puctuality of pickup was a bit dodgy When we go back to Dubai  we will definitely book here again  
N =>   great service i just finished my stay at this hotel and booked it having read the advice on this sight  i was very pleased with the location of the hotel as we were smack bang in the middle between the souks and the deira city mall   pretty much a   dhs cab ride    aud  to get to either  the staff were lovely  especially jeff   as they booked our lunch at the burj al arab and also the desert safari  our car ride back to the apt was thrown in for free  breakfast was included and a good way to start the day with lots of fresh food  the room was very comfy and roomy  having just come from paris it was huge    all was very clean and well maintained  had a small gym and roof top pool   we walked    girls  at night to go to dinner and was very safe   be sure to check out the arabian restaurant just a few doors down    off the top of my head its called bashwan  but try the hubbly bubbly and local food  they took great care of us    
N => Very Nice Hotel I stayed in this hotel   th ust         st t      with my wife on   mths old daughter  we were on vacation from London and wanted a good place to stay  I had read the reviews and thought it had passed my test by OVER     Our flight arrived Dubai at     am and by     am  we were at the Hotel  check in was not till  pm  we were about   guest waiting to have rooms allocated and by   am  we were ushered in our rooms Hotel is classed as a   star  Sincerely  I will give it a very top   star rating  centrally located  our room       was large and very clean  big bathroom  MINI Bar   room service everyday  breakfast was very nice also  We also had a complimentary pickup and drop off at the airport which was just   mins away  Hotel has a    hour guest service facility  we used this a few times to order late night food Other facilities we enjoyed included internet access  sw pool  sauna  gym etcReally  I cant fault this hotel  the staffs were absolutely fantastic  Mahmood  Hotel PRO  Amin  Car Hire Service  Ymn  Breakfast Room  Bernard  Porter  and everyone at Coral Deira  Thank you  we had a GREAT time  Please feel free to use this Hotel  I strongly recommend  Thanks 
Not great at all So which wise guy gave this hotel a   star rating   Just because the bathroom tiles was made by villeroy and boch does not make it a   star  I stayed here for five nights and lets just say its was comfortable but never again  Mr room had a view   of the building next door s balcony strewn with old broken appliances  The jumeirah beach this place aint  The breakfast was not great and more of a three star standard but the icing on the cake was when my hotel room door was left open for around   hours with my laptop on my bed along with my digital camera  I went mental as any  could have walked in and taken it  When i pointed this out   the manager he told me at least it was not stolen  I saw red  Another annoying little gripe that each time i needed   ask   a clothes iron  what sort of   star dont have irons in the rooms   And the room service dont understand what are asking for   i asked for an emory board and was sent ear buds  The great thing about this hotel is the location on muraqabat street otherwise its just a three star dresses as a five  
N =>  nice and personal i went to stay here with my sister  We were two girls from the UK and were abit hesitant as we had never actually heard of this hotel    we came onto trip advisor before going to read the reviews  But I must say the reviews we read were abit off putting  When we got there the transfers was excellent the gentleman was there waiting for us  When we got to the hotel the main reception i must say wasnt very appealing surely not for a    but must go on and conclude that the service was excellent breakfast was great and the hotel staff reallt made you feel that you was personally serviced  I would go again  
N => Good but not    Hotel was nice but did not feel    compared to others we have stayed in  Breakfast was average  We had requested a no smoking room and were put in a smoking room that retained the smell throughout our stay  However on the plus side the hotel was in a very convenient location for shopping with shopping centres a short walk and taxi ride away  Plus it had the added bonus of a free shuttle bus to its sister hotel in Sharjah which was excellent  
N =>  Comfortable and centrtal We spent seven nights at the Coral Deira         ch       Having read mixed reviews about the courtesy shuttle service   we decided to take a taxi  At around three miles away   it took around ten minutes and costs very little An early check in was requested   but our arrival at the hotel meant that we were too early for our room to be ready   so we had to wait This was not a problem  we were offered a cold drink and encouraged to have a look around the hotel  We decided to leave our luggage with staff and rested by the swimming pool for an hour or so The tripple room requested  was a good size with a king size bed and simple single bed  The layout of the room was good  with good space and clean  The furniture of a good quality The hotel has a nice welcoming reception area with good staff The breakfast was fine but nothing spectacular  The layout of the eating area was spacious  comfortable and pleasantly decorated As for the location  it is central  but streets are often difficult to walk due to a car centric society Anyone planning to visit Deira  should strongly consider staying here  
N => Well worth the money  
N =>   Not bad but be careful  
N =>   Not   star    at most  
N =>   Very nice hotel but not   star  
N =>   loved it we got a good room with balcony  Also very good service  ket place and gold souk was within walking distance we stayed there for   nights  I really loved the hotel and the yummy breakfast they served  only problem was to get a taxi  we had to wait for       mins  
N =>  Average at best We didn t have a great experience at this hotel  It was noisy and the hotel staff were indifferent  We complained about some guests who were making noise in the early hours of the morning but staff didn t appear to care  The location is not great   next to busy roads  It was hard to get a taxi  We wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone  
N =>   pain in the neck It took an hour for the shuttle bus to pick me up from the airport  and when i finally arrived however i ordered some food which was a kebab mix  it looked great until my younger son ate it when we realised that there was a fish kebab in the mix as he is allergic to fish  Tell me  how many fish kebabs to you get in a mixed grill  My son had a reaction which could of killed him and we asked for the ambulance service  due to the location of the hotel it took half an hour for the ambulance to come Be aware that hospitals in Dubai are hopeless and the docters don t have a clue what to do in a life and death situation Thank God he survived as I had never saw him in this state ever After the long night  my family and I went to have breakfast  the staff are really nice however the food was not edible and they didn t have many options of food  They gave the same breakfast everyday and i stayed their for a fortnight Then you get the taxi problem  No taxi goes past the hotel so you have to get the concierge to order one for you  The taxi service they get charges nearly double than the other public taxis  When you mention that you want to go to the Coral oriental hotel they do not have a clue where that is and I have resulted to giving directions to the hotel    times To stop the taxi problem i decided to rent a car from the hotel desk office  The man at the desk seemed trustworthy and probably wouldn t cause any more problems  I asked him if the cars were all insured and he said yes  After three days in driving in the dangrous roads of Dheirah i had been crashed  let me warn you that accidents occur all the time in Dubai and is probaly tone of the worst places to drive  When i told the man at the desk that i had crashed he told me that the car actually was not insured  I had to pay a hefty bill  i couldn t do anything about it but the manager of the tourist operater in the hotel said that the man at the desk will be paying a quarter of the fine  That sounds better but they still charged me a hefty bill This was the worst Trip i have ever had and i travelled all over the Gulf and Dubai five times and i have always enjoyed it but this hotel one of the worst hotel in the world 
N =>   Nothing There  Hotel check in was fine  room was clean and respectable  not up to the    rating though Then  safe was locked and unusable  water pipe sprung a leak and flooded the bathroom  cleaning was poor  there is no bar in the hotel  no pool and no real facilities to speak of  The business centre was one laptop which is unconnected to any printer Taxis are very difficult to get due to it s location  Staff were disinterested  Not up to the standards of other similarly rated properties in Dubai  
N =>  Could Not Sleep or Find A Taxi You will be middle of a traffic jam with no taxi to stop Waited   Hours  no lie  for a Taxi out side  After we walked to city center  But its winter and    C  Summer time you can die if you be that long outside  They cant find you Taxi Taxi drivers begin curse when you tell them to go there from a mallActually two of them said  quot  my bad luck  quot  to meThere are diggings front of the hotel Metro or something is under construction under the hotel so you will have constant noise and shake My Room smelled cigarette and that smell came from air condition You must explain your problem and insist to have solution till you get mad Location of the hotel is like Bronx in New YorkDolapdere in Turkey  Little India in SingaporeFind a hotel in Jumeirah if you don t like India because Deria is a Indian Town  Left alone like Dead city Dubai s wealth never touched hereMy room had a constant noise that came from a huge machine room next to it  When you look Outside window you will only see a court surrounded by long walls and Noisy smokestack on the middle We paid       for each  inc  Plane tickets   For   NightsNot cheap Should have   stars not  For Turkish People I would say  quot  Uzak Durun  quot  Means  quot  Stay Away  quot  
N => i will be coming back i went to meet my boyfriend over in dubai after not seeing him for a few months  we aranged to stay at a diffrent hotel but it was not avalible so we was given the choice to stay at the coral oriental insted so we desided to take it  when ariving in dubai we just wanted some where we could both catch up on the months that have gone past  this hotel was very help full as soon as we got into the hotel there was someone to help us with our bags  they always had a smile and was happy to help  the price wasnt bad for the hotel and it deserves its four stars  the food was really nice we often called to get it ordered up to our room  also when we went out during the day the hotel staff made sure they flaged down a taxi for us which didnt take long as the roads are really busy as for the noise there is some that we could hear in our hotel room but no enuff to disturb you sleep  there is only two english channels on the tvs in the room which had some very good films on and news through out the day  there is no pool in the hotel  but for a small taxi fare its worth going to use other hotels swimming pools and beaches  there is a great pool in the hotel next to planet hollywood  its nice to go have a meal then relax by the pool after a few drinks  and as far as i know its open to anyone  in the streets of dubai its best for women to have as much as you can covered as the amount of men that look at you is unbeliveable  to keep with the religion have your shoulders covered  over all this hotel is very nice and looks better than the photos that are on the internet i would certainly go back there again  if you like your english breaky to much dont go to dubai as you wont be able to have bacon  they do have beef bacon but it isnt the same  o and if you have any trouble with the taxi drivers it helps to show them the card from the hotel it has a map on it which helps them find the hotel  they also all answer to the name Harry give it ago  x 
N =>   for work but place was good to relax after a long day quiet and nice had gone for work but place was well adjusted and kept for some one to rest after a long day 
N =>   Not great noisy expensive Long drive from DXB through   km building site  Best restaurant items pricey  Lots of uncontrolled children and associated noise and nuisance  Disturbed sleep throughout stay due to noise of guests coming and going  and cleaning and maintenance work Small pool  used by lots of children  some incontinent Not good  Won t revisit if I don t have to   much better available elsewhere in Dubai  
Not a fan           I have stayed at this hotel a few times and it is fairly average The most recent time was during Ramadan and I was actually yelled at by the pool attendant for taking a sip of water discreetly A very functional hotel which is linked to a small shopping centre  The pool and gym area are ok  Rooms are comfortable and modern  the hotel is fairly new   There is a restaurant which serves a buffet but I didnt find the quality very good  I found a great japanese restaurant just outside the hotel  part of the shopping complex Not a lot around unless you have business in the area  
Nice affordable hotel in Dubai Stayed here for more than   month  It is a bit far away from the  quot major quot  Dubai attractions  about    AED to Dubai Internet City      AED from the airport  but a really nice hotel in a quite location The internet connection is really expensive  AED     per week  but reliable  A small shopping mall is connected to the hotel and there are a couple of nice restaurant around the lake  the japanese one is highly recommended   They also offer a shuttle service to the mall of emirates and jebel ali resort  The room service could ve been a bit better   stuff which was on the floor stayed on the floor and they cleaned around it  
N => Ok Hotel Very simple and basic hotel with small swimming pool  The price we paid does not worth the standards  Wouldn t go back  
NIce Hotel  I arrived on         spent couple nights at the hotel  then moved to the apartment building which is connected to its hotel  I stayed her for a month thou The hotel pool is great  I mostly spent time at the gym before the pool  Unlike other riott  this hotel has no a suana or steamroom  They should have some  cos they have plenty of room to add these on Food is good  and reasonable price  The lobby area always serve a nice sandwitches and coffee  In addition  there is a shop and restaurants   grocery store  Bank  ATM  Laundry shop or internet shop at the shopping strip area  It is very convenient for those who doesn t have cars or no need to drive However  there is one hotel receiptionist always keep smiling  but i felt it isn t quite genuine  Well  I have to look over it since he didn t do anything wrong The hotel bar on the  nd floor   seems so so   I wouldn t recommend much since the staff aren t professional enough in making drinks  it takes    mins to get a drink  Cosmopolitan  served on New Year s Eve  And it sucks big time  I planned to get drinks for myself         dirums but ended up    dirums and I walked back to my room The Hotel apartment at the back seems nicer than the hotel itself The room is nicer with a kitchen area where you can cook with fully equiped kitchenware  and nice view indeed  You will feel like home if you pick the apartment  rather than the hotel room The price seems abit expensive  but if it is not  I probably dont have a place to stay since all people will come to stay here  I think the long rent should give more special rate to client   like me  LOLLocation is not a problem from me to work  but its traffic is a big issue  Particularly  the annoying roundabout that I need to travel to work or even my colleague tried to pick me up  seems very unpleasant People get tired of this traffic  Some taxi driver even denied to give me a ride because I am staying at this hotel  I ended up walking back to the hotel from the big roundabouts while rainy all that evening  This is unacceptable aweful i ever had in my life  The best receiptionist at the Hotel Apartment i even known  is ROBIN  He is the best  His friendship and service are touched  He does has a genuine smile  I will recommend people stay here  if you dont want to see many construction around Dubai  Then choose this hotel  you can enjoy your days or weekends in the park Thank ROBIN  you are superb  
N =>  Fabulous service nothing too much trouble Have just returned from staying at the riott Courtyard for a week with my husband and    year daughter  We booked a suite  Room      as there was   of us and got a fabulous rate for it  Upon entering the suite there was a bit of a lobby area with the most amazing flower display and a card signed by the staff welcoming us  Flower displays were abundant throughout  THe room was tastefully decorated  the bed  extra King size  was super comfy  Clean towels and everything replenished everyday if you wished  Well stocked minibar  Room service was excellent  but most importantly the helpfulness of the staff was second to none  Always a smile and a hello on passing  The food was good  prices very amenable  The Bar staff in particular deserve a mention  My only gripe would be that you had to get to the pool early to grab a sunbed  but it was the christmas season so they were extra busy  However  even on days that a bed wasnt available  the staff made sure you were comfortable with cushions etc and as soon as one because available they would bring it to you  I definately would recommend this hotel and would stay again  
N =>   nice hotel but don t arrive in your own car The hotel is very modern and rooms well furnished to a very high standard  Location was good  less than   mins drive from the airport and right next to a shopping mall complex so a good choice of shopping and restaurants  There is even a large supermarket should you want your own things  The major problem I had was parking my rental car  I parked in the underground car park the first night  arriving at  am  but the next day security refused to let me park it  they said it had to be valet parked  Discussions with the concierge and others got different answers depending on who you asked  or sometimes different answers from the same person   min later  you cannot park yourself  You can park yourself but must be on level P   You must have a valet parking attendant drive you down to P  but you can drive out yourself  You can park yourself but must leave the keys with the valet parking attendant I have only had compulsory valet parking once before  at Hyatt in vancouver   because the then US president  Bill Clinton was staying at the same hotel  In dubai I certainly did not see any serving US presidents   Worst time was being driven to P  by the valet parking attendant  taking the keys to my room  then being called and told to get the car moved to P   The following morning I asked for the keys and was taken down to the valet parking office  keys were not there  they were back at the front desk   Staff did not seem to realise that when I leave to work in the morning I want to go down  walk to the car and drive away  Waiting around even for  min is not acceptable and I do not want any risk of a long wait due to sudden rush of people leaving for work in the morning  On check out my bill had a charge for internet  even through my corporate rate included it  and one night the system knew this and didn t charge  but another night it decided to charge me   They did take the charge off straight away  but check your bills   
N =>   Can only recommend    Enjoyed a great stay at Crowne Plaza   Festival City   business  amp  pleasure     can only recommend    Lovely  amp  large rooms   Superb service   pool   gym   food etc   Pure   star   Close to shopping  amp  the Airport as well why this hotel is great for both business  amp  pleasure      
New Clean and Non Smoking Having just return from our trip to the UK we chose to have a   day    night stopover in Dubai  Having never been their before and unsure  we turned to TripAdvisor for advice  Following extensive reviews of fellows guests  we selected the Crowne Plaza Festival City and we were not disappointed  Although we stayed in an executive high floor room with a creek view  it was everything one should expect from this chain and more  It is totally non smoking  the first I believe and the rooms were a treat as a result  From the early check in at      am  to the assistance with our activities including the hotels own taxi to the airport all was great  Special mention mention must go to the pool gym spa team  they keep this place a treat  This is a relative a new hotel and it is being maintained at that level  The proximity to Airport  Festival City Waterfront  which is still under construction  it s shopping and cheap eats  plus the facilities of it s sister hotel the Intercontinental creates a package that is hard to beat at the price  With the opening of Dubai s soon to be completed monorail it will only enhance it s position  The hop on hop off bus comes to the door and so much more  My wife would not let me complete this review without a mention of the fabulous breakfast we enjoyed each morning  part of the package and highly recommended   Not only do we intent to stay their on our return trip to Europe in il  I would recommend the place without hesitation  As with anything in life nothing is perfect  They have in the joint a great pub called the Belgium Bar great beer s  great food but it is a SMOKING PUB in a non smoking hotel go figure  Coming from Australia where the pub s are now non smoking I question this  only to be told that the non smoking area was upstairs  dose not smoke rise  Additionally on check in we were offered an upgrade to a suite at an additional price  we declined  on check out I over heard some new arrival s being offered the same deal  so don t expect a free upgrade  I have not included photo s are their is already enough  
N =>   Great hotel for a short stay Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for   nights as a stopover for the start of our honeymoon  Previously when we ve been to Dubai we have stayed at a beach location  However as time was not on our side this time so we opted for a hotel in a location that was easy to access from the airport etc   First impressions of the hotel were very good  it took just over    minutes from the airport ideal for a short stay  The hotel has a Belgium bar attached which was quiet week nights but very busy on Thursday night  It was a   minute taxi ride to Le Meridien hotel which has about    restaurants one being Yalumba famous for the Dubai brunches on Friday afternoons  It was also only   minutes taxi from The Irish Village which was also very good The pool area was very nice and clean it linked up the the Inter Continental Hotel so both pool areas could be used  Pool snacks are served in the Inter Continental area as the Crowne Plaza tried to persuade guests to opt for the buffet lunch  The pool area has views of the Dubai Tower on a clear day Room service was okay  we had paid for breakfast as part of our hotel package however when we phoned for our breakfast to be sent to the room they told us we would have to pay extra by paying for breakfast again  After many complaints the breakfast finally arrived in our room which was very good All in all it was a good location and a   minute walk to the shopping mall in Festival City which was extremely quiet compared to the huge Dubai Mall  The Dubai Mall and Fountain are just a    minute taxi ride away and well worth a visit  I would stay in the hotel again although I did miss the beach  
Nice Hotel I reviewed this hotel after a one night stay for an overnight layover  I had a very good experience  Based on that stay  I decided to stay here for a week on my trip to Dubai for business I still liked the hotel but after a six night stay I have some additional observations  I still liked the modern  clean and comfortable hotel rooms  The ipod docking station was a nice feature My coworker stayed at the adjoining Intercontinental and I would stay there the next time  His room was equally as nice but his rate was slightly lower than mine  The included breakfast at the IC was far and away superior  The CP breakfast had a very limited selection where the IC has an almost unlimited selection of choices from a fresh juice bar where you select the fruit mixture  to a deli bar where they shave meat fresh to standard Asian  European  Middle Eastern and American breakfast fare including pork bacon With my longer stay  I had a chance to use the amenities more extensively  The pools are very nice  I preferred the CP pool because it had lap lanes  However  the pools had lots of unsupervised children both in the pool and around the pool  Most of the time  the staff looked the other way  Almost ever visit to the pool  there were groups of children who would jump in the hot tubs then run across the pool area and recklessly jump in the pool  get out and return to the hot tub and repeat over and over  Children regularly played in the lap lanes rather than the rest of the pool  I felt the staff should have been more aggressive in keeping the lap lanes clear for lap swimmers and minimizing the dangerous horseplay  Instead my coworker and I had several minor collisions with children and many more near misses  The pool was plenty big for everyone but there was no control by most of the the staff and no parents present Another issue occurred in the fitness centers  The fitness centers look very clean  However  each time I visited  I used one of the floor mats  When I was finished  I asked the staff for something to clean it and each time  they said just leave it and they would clean it  I watched through the window as the staff member just folded the mat and put it back on the pile  No cleaning  That is just unacceptable  At least put out a spray bottle of cleaner for the guest to clean it themselves Overall  the hotel is still very nice but based on these things  I have to dropped my rating some  
N =>   GREAT HOLIDAY very good hotel which is linked to a nice shopping mall the only problem was that it was too hot and it was difficult to be at the pool during the day  The view from the creek side room was blurred as we could not discern the burg dubai during the whole week of our stay  one thing that I would recommend is to find out with certainty as to wether there really exist a policy of early check in as we were made to pay for the night though we arrived at the hotel at  am  
N =>  Perfect for stop over in Dubai We used this hotel on   occasions as a stopover en route to NZ from UK  Both times we were able to check in at  am as our flights arrived in Dubai really early  This wasn t a problem for the reception  and we really appreciated it as we were travelling with a   month old  The pools were fine  if a bit on the small side for Dubai  bit the hotel was lovely  The only criticism was the fire alarm which went off on Friday evening with no explanation as to what had happened   we had to evacuate with our baby down the back stairs to the pool where no one knew what was happening   people were still playing in the pool and had no idea  Apparently there was no  real fire  but who knows  I would suggest asking for a room on the Dubai Creek side  much better view  Hotel lexus transfer to the airport is only    dhrms  which is cheaper than a taxi  Festival City shops were impressive  but apparently there are better malls in Dubai if thats your thing  overall  great hotel for a great rate  off their website   Will def be back on the next trip down under  
N =>   Fantastic hotel with fantastic staff We have just returned from    nights at the Crowne Plaza Festival City  This was our third visit to Dubai but our first stay at this great hotel  Our check in time was  pm but due to our flight timings we arrived at the hotel at   am but this was not a problem and within    mins of arriving we were in our room  My party was my wife my    year old daughter and myself  the guys arrives with a fold down bed for my daughter which made to room seem a bit smaller  with hindsight I should have booked a larger room  but this was not a major problem  The staff in this hotel were fantastic and always went an extra mile to make sure that nothing was a problem  From the guys who looked after the room and were happy to supply extra bottles of water when needed and the lifeguards at the pool who handed out cold towels and slices of pineapple  The hotel is attached by a walkway to the Intercontinental Hotel and the Festival City shopping plaza with over     shops and eating places  There is even a Panda Supermarket for any holiday extras you forgot to pack  A surprise for us on our first day was an invitation to the manager s cocktail reception the next night in the Belgian Beer Cafe with free food and drink plus a chat with the senior staff from the two hotels  Our stay was fantastic and we will be back as the staff are brilliant and know how to look after their guests from the front desk staff to the girls in the coffee bar to the room cleaners and the security staff who always had the time to say hello  
N =>   Mixed experience    Our booking was with Virgin Holidays which was pretty striaghtfoward thats until a query came up  I must have called up    times and gone through various departments but my query was not resolved untill I emailed the Hotel myself  The Hotel was nice and clean most of the staff were very friendly and always helpful We were told to pay a deposit at check in which was not mentioned before   On our last night day I stupidly forget one my shopping bags in the taxi I spoke to one gentlemen at reception who by the way never looked happy to be there As a panicked shopper who lost my beautiful abaya that I had purchased I was given little sympathy from him I was told by other staff members that the Hotel could contact the taxi firm I understood that it was a long shot but this particular gentlemen was very dismissive and not very helpful However the Head of Security spoke to me and was going to check the cameras too see if he could get a reg number for the taxi    which was very kind of him  unlike his collegue Other than that the breakfast buffet was lovely we chose to eat at the in house restaurant Zaytoun which was nothing special average really Overall I would say it was neither a great experiance or negative one   
Not Family Friendly Booked and prepaid for   nights  a so called Advance breakfast rate There was no breakfast option for my daughter  even after paying the breakfast rate before travelling  Wanted another extra    dh per night for additional bed   deposit of     dhs by credit card which I simply refused  have stayed in crown plaza Geneva etc  and this was the first time I have experienced a shoddy service from Front Office I simply think they don t know who their customers are On the positive side close to the Airport and shopping Malls  and inter connected to a shopping centre with shops and plenty of eating options Room service was very good and runs an efficient restaurant with plenty of staff Used the Internet at the Business centre  but excessive pricing for users about    per half hour Pool  Gym Sauna all ok This is not a Family friendly Hotel  good for business travellers If you are travelling with family my advice is to shop around  or if you are a priority Club member better to phone and get some information before you book from the hotel Group  that will put you at ease when you arrive 
Nice convenient hotel We stayed at the crowne plaza festival city for   days last week  After choosing this hotel through lots of research and reading reviews on trip advisor  we pretty much knew what to expect here  Location  Its about    mins frm the airport and about the same to Dubai Mall  U need a taxi to go about and they are quite easy to find  With the festival city mall attached  you have a pretty nice extension you can walk about  grab a snack  watch a movie  The downside is  this hotel is quite far from the bustling sh zayed road  Rooms  We stayed in a city view superior room and being the cheapest in the category  was still very spacious  The clear glass screen between the bedroom and bathroom was great for my  yr old playing in the bathtub and watching TV  not to mention we not having to worry about her playing in the water  The decor is contemporary but could be better Food  Buffet breakfast is quite nice but food otherwise is the biggest negative this hotel has  We ate at the room only a few times and they were all bad experiences  Please dont try their pizza   Staff  Staff were very pleasant and anthing you need is not too difficult for them  They are well trained and extremely courteous Activities  With our   yr old there wasnt much we could do but sit at the pool  The intercontinental is attached so you can use the pools of either hotel  It was quite child frendly and we had a great time whenever we went for a swim  
N =>  Worst experience in    years of travel  The hotel customer service needs major improvements  I haven t had such a terrible hotel experience in my    years of travel  I come to Dubai at least   times out of the year due to business and always enjoy myself  Since I had heard such great things about the Dubai festival city area I decided to give it a try  And I must admit the area was quite nice and convenient for shopping  entertainment and eating out  The Crowne Plaza on the other hand was just awful  I booked my room online and prepaid for the best rate  When I arrived at the hotel to check in they took a deposit for double the amount without making me aware of it  Making my way to my room I found that I did not a city view as requested  but a view of a highway and the other side of the hotel  The setup of the room was nice  And I thought the bathroom was impressive until I found out the water pressure was weak and there was no hot water  Internet was about     a day and it did not work one day of my three days there  We calls on the issues several times with no reply  Although they did send someone up to the room at  am to fix the Internet which I thought was quite rude  We did take advantage of room service and the bar restaurant down stairs and found the food to be lacking in flavor  When the day came to check out I was so relieved  Upon checking out we found out I was being charged for a call my friend made from an AT amp T toll free phone card  I was asked why and was told it was because she used        amp  it is not toll free only       is toll free  After having a conversation about different US toll free numbers for about a hour with the assistant mgr and the hotel mgr we paid the    us dollars for one phone call and decided to follow up on the issue later  And I have to say the hotel manager attitude was concerning  He made no attempt to research the situation or offer any other alternatives  He just kept telling us the      is not a toll free number and we should have used      instead  It was really sad to see a hotel in such a great location have such terrible customer service  But after meeting the manager of the hotel it all made sense  So if you want to stay in the Dubai festival plaza area  amp  enjoy it   please stay somewhere else  
N =>   The Pearl turns into a Diamond Since there has been a major crisis around the world we decided take some additional time off to get away from the stress of the worlds downward spiraling news of every day  we decided to come back to this hotel because of their amazing prices in this crisis we paid this time nearly half the price we paid from last time and I can tell you the quality has not changed it just gets better and cheaper for all We would like to say though the staff at this hotel and especially from front desk to the valet parking and room service and also the Anise Restaurant in the connecting Intercontinental are      how well mannered  informative they always are  Congratulations you have pulled of again our   nights were great    we will be back to try out the new golf course next time for sure  
N => 	star hotel with   star customer service  We booked   nights from        after researching lots of hotels using tripadvisor  All the reviews are accurate as this is a fabulous hotel in a convenient quite location  We will return  amp  can highly recommend upgrading to a room with creek view  Breakfast is excellent as was my complementary birthday cake  
Nice hotel but far away from the centre This hotel was very clean and staff very helpful Food was good and poolside was good   nice music and atmosphere long way from the centre but it is next to a huge shopping centre  so plenty to do in the evenings great hotel for business users  but it would be boring for a holiday   recommend the resort hotels near the coast Would return for work or a short break with the children but not for any longer than   nights  
N =>   Very impressed from beginning to end How refreshing to stay in a hotel where they believe in customer service  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left  nothing was too much trouble  The staff were courteous and friendly  each with a ready smile and a warm greeting Having arrived at     am after a long flight from Australia to be told our room was ready was a very pleasant surprise and even better to be asked would we like breakfast The room was spacious  with an amazing view over the creek of the city skyline  It s a view you will never tire of at any time of day or night Breakfast offered a good choice  our   year old son believes himself to be an expert  and he was more than happy and full each morning The pool area was nicely laid out with a vast choice of pools to suit all ages  You never felt as if you were on top of each other whilst soaking up the sun watching the helicopters land at Festival City  Nice touch of cold towels and fruit offered throughout the day Would have no hesitation in returning as very impressed by the total package  
N =>   Confusing check in Had pre booked this hotel for   nights with Asia Rooms  being a family of   had requested inter connecting rooms  on early arrival the guy at reception said that as we had only booked standard rooms which were not ready and he could not give us connecting rooms as requested as the hotel was full  however  we could have the available connecting de luxe rooms on floor    with creek views for an extra        per night or adjoining rooms on floor    for        extra per night  What he did not explain was that the extra price was per room per night   When I questioned this  suddenly he checked the computer again  and then said that he could only offer us de luxe  creek view  connecting rooms on floor   at        per room per night  So I am guessing that the standard rooms are all facing the courtyard entrance  I had also paid for   breakfasts for my family  but with an early check out on the last day I had e mailed prior to our stay and asked if we could have one breakfast on arrival as we could not possibly have it on the checkout day  the reply agreed  no problem  BUT when I mentioned this to the same man on reception on arrival he said NO but we could have a packed breakfast when leaving at     am on our last day  I promptly showed him the copy of the e mail  and guess what he said fine  we could have the paid breakfast as we had it in writing Now being a priority club member I am not sure what if any perks were offered to me  yes the hotel was excellent  but I just felt like the man on reception was being difficult  no standard connecting rooms available  hotel was full  could not honour breakfast request on  st day  only de luxe rooms on creek side  I would be interested to know if anyone else had the same experience  
N => Not quite open yet  We travelled to Dubai for a fantastic value weekend offer with Virgin last weekend  half price       each  which was too tempting to miss We were booked in the Crowne Plaza  though having been held outside the hotel for   mins   quot There s a photoshoot going on quot   we were then told to walk across to the sister hotel   The Intercontinental We had a great stay  see Intercontinental review for more  but beware that these two new hotels are clearly under capacity so are shifting guests around  It wasn t a big problem at all and shouldn t impact your holiday  The initial impression on arrival wasn t great though given the high quality of service on display thereafter  
N =>   Great place to stay  Everyone at the Crown Plaza was very helpful  The rooms were vey nice and I had a geat view  We booked the Desert Safari through the hotel and was very pleased  The pool area was nice  The internet service in the room was expensive  the business centr was reasonable but not as convenient  The location of the hotal was very good  close to the malls and restaurants  
N =>  cold bath water cold bath water but very pleasent and helpfull hotel staff 
N =>  Liked This Hotel       Myself  amp  My Husband stayed in this Hotel for two nights  amp  we were upgraded to Captain Suite there Hotel is located on Sheikh Zayed Road  amp  easily accessible from Airport As Hotel is having complementary shuttle service from Airport  amp  also for Mall of Emirates Rooms were good  amp  we liked it      amp  we had nice experience there  
N =>   Dated and therefore cheaper than other   stars in Dubai There s a good reason why this hotel tends to be cheaper than most of its star competitors in Dubai  it s dated and they know it  I stayed in a standard business room  Size was fine but furniture needs a makeover     and please  do replace that carpet  Bathroom was clean and water pressure okay  Staff was overall helpful throughout stay  For the gym fanatics  the sports facilities are very good   there s a big gym with all the free weights and machines you find back home  Food  breakfast was okay but not great in quality  sweaty cheese       For dinner lunch  I recommend Wagemama s next door  which serves excellent Asian food at very reasonable prices  
Nice Hotel in central location Hotel is conveniently located near main business area called Sheikh Zayed Road  Hotel services were excellent  Hotel has nice pool open on open floor  We have kid on age   n      they enjoyed their time in pool  The pool attendant was quit nice  Hotel has exclusive floors where they separate dedicated business lounge  Hotel has good restaurants  Hotel premises have quit good shopping area including a supermarket  Hotel  Considering all hotel is a good stay for business guests and nice stay for leisure guest as well  
Nice rooms but average hotel amenities The Crowne Plaza in Dubai is perfectly located on the bustling Sheikh Zayed Rd with a close proximity to the Emirates Towers  As a business hotel its fairly decent with clean and big rooms and a good choice of restaurants such as wagamama and a popular italian restaurant located in the hotel lobby However  other facilities such as the Hotel pool and fitness centre are well below average requiring refurbishment  Dont even get me started on the spa and the treatment rooms which even lack proper lighting and ambience  The pool though has potential with a good view overlooking Sheikh Zayed Rd Stay away from the night club at the hotel called Zinc which does attract crowd looking to get into trouble   
NICE HOTEL VERY WELL SITUATED We reaaly enjoyed our stay at this hotel  We arranged a transfer via hotel website before travelling and were met after Customs and directed to a waiting car   friendly driver and excellent service  On arrival at hotel we were given an upgrade to a suite overlooking the Emirates Towers fabulous views of the whole area  We had booked a deluxe kingsize room for the three of us  but space would have been a little tight  they advised  All the staff were pleasant and helpful  Not really a hotel for holiday makers  a lot of business people  but the restaurants are good  and pool is usually quiet  We found the central location the best feature  only    minutes from the airport     minutes from Emirates Mall        mins from Dubai Creek depending on traffic  The creek has a very distinct atmosphere  very busy  vibrant and hot   The hotel runs a bus transfer to Jumeriah Beach Park but this was a little disappointing facilities there are not good toilets and showers are very basic  and in need of renovation not up to usual Dubai standards  Well located for all shopping malls and good choice of restaurants in the immediate vacinity if you chhose not to eat in the hotel itself  
N =>   Not bad but a bit dated I spent three nights at the CP Dubai during a business trip in        First of all the level of service was very high  especially when compared to similar hotels in Europe  Pick up at the airport worked smoothly  so did the arrival at the hotel  surrounded by hotel staff helping with bags  check in  etc  The room was nice  big bathroom in dark stone  marble    fresh fruit delivered daily and well equipped mini bar  The only downside to the room was the slight dated feel of the furniture  though spotless One warning for the lifts though  it takes forever to get to your floor  so make sure you don t forget something before you leave your room    Breakfeast was ok but not really the standard I was hoping for  A lot of fresh fruits though and good selection of freshly squeezed juices  The CP Dubai is a nice  clean hotel with a good level of quality and services  Beeing a bit dated I would probably choose another hotel next time  not because I was disappointed but rather to experience the contemporary style of Dubai s prime hotels  
N =>  over priced and over rated I stayed at the Crowne Plaza  Dubai for a couples of days last week on a business trip  Arrived at the hotel to find it fully booked even though my reservation was made weeks ago  After some discussion at the reception  around    minutes  they found me a room which they indicated to be  quot very good quot   In fact it turned out to be  quot nothing special quot  This is supposed to be a   star hotel  but I have stayed in a lot better during my travels  In fact I have never stayed in a hotel so expensive at AED      nt  around      nt    certainly not worth the money Other aspects of the hotel   rooms clean but in need of modernisation  service was reasonably good  food was average  location reasonable for the airport but not great for shopping or for the beach My recommendation   search around and find something better and cheaper  
N =>  Excellent hotel I stayed at the hotel for one night one my way to England from New Zealand  I had booked a club room and was not disappointed  I was concerned as my flight arrived at     am and I was at the hotel by     am  This was not a problem as a room was allocated immediately by the helpful reception staff  The room was a good size and clean and cool  The club lounge on the   th floor was excellent  so was the service and breakfast  I would certainly stay here again 
N =>  Just ok Our time at the Crowne Plaza was ok  It is not a service oriented property  If people claim it is then they had a very different experience or they don t know what top service looks like The breakfast buffet was lackluster and had flies flying around the tables  The house band in the bar was soooooooooooooooo bad we could not finish our drinks 
N =>  Fab Crowne Plaza we were   girls going to Dubai for a week s hols and had booked   rooms but the reservation staff suggested that we book a   bed apt which actuall worked out a better price Breasfast was not included but you could order room service  The kitchen had a dishwasher washing machine tumble drier and all other usual appliances  Take tablets for the dishwasher and washing machine as they were not supplied  There was a large twin and double bedroom  beds were turned down everynight and a choclate left on yr pillow  apartment was cleaned every day and there were ample sullplies of towels  robes  amp  slippers  there was also a large dining area sitting room  but try and get a room at back of hotel as the traffic never stops  There was a complementary shuttle to the beach and town centre  they also collected us at the airport  The staff were polite  amp  very helpfull  We travelled everywhere by taxi as local transport is not great  taxi s are cheap as the metre only runs when car is moving  there was much more to do in Dubai than we expected so a return journey is on the cards and the Crowne plaza will be booked again  
N => A great Experience  
N =>  it was fab    
N =>   No complaints  
N => Memorable experience  
N =>  Comfortable yet old fashioned  Getting more expensive  
N =>   The worst service ever      This Friday ember    th I have visited my friends who still stay there at Dar Al Maseyaf Guld House and Al Qasr  The day there was a Global Summit  so the security was agitated  but that is OK  I undertsand  But when i was not allowed to go to the beach under the pretexte that only one person stays in this villa and he is already on the beach  I tried to explain that the guy is in the room  his wife is on the beach waiting for me and she informed reception thta she expects a visitor  the guy at the beach reception was particularly rude  he said nit allowed and that is it I asked for Manager First manager also gave the same report  I said you are given all those lists with gusets names  with which purpose  if you are not sure  just check  The rude one was telling there was no need to check  I said that I would complain  he glared at me and said  as you wish Finally the second guy found the villa number  called my friend s husband and got the confirmation  I was allowed to go and Nobody apologized   Do you think you are charging your guests to be humiliated  And then on the beacj we ordered a bottle of wine and srawberries     minites after we got the wine but no strawberries later the waiter told us  Strawberries appeared when the wine was finished  We ordered another bottle  it ttok them more than a n hour when we were going to leave  The waiter apologizedbut told that no wine was available a t the bar so he had to go to the main restaurant  Excuse me  it is our problem     Why do not keep the bars stocked    Why do not serve faster   And by the way  the waiter could not open the bottle  we had to help him and open it ourself    I think the management has to pay back the guests the price they charge the hotel is beautiful  but the service is unbelievably bad  
N =>   It could have been perfect    Since my first visit to Dubai  The Dar Al Masyaf fascinated me with it s lovely architecture and classy environment  Unfortunately  I cannot afford  and do not accept  paying     euros a night for a room Fortunately  this year  they had a special Ramadan promotion for     euros a night  As I was going on hollidays to the Maldives  via Emirates  I decided to have a one night stopover When you go to the DAM  I think  you expect the best  the top  the perfection  Arriving was a bit complicated  as I got lost on the different hotels and ended up at Mina  They were perfect and dispatched me on an abra to Al Qasr  where I would do my check in Check in was ok  a bit unpersonal  We were taken to villa     a bit far away  but as buggys are always available  this was no real problem  The butler service was good  and the room is very very very beautiful and confortable  I was asked what time I would be leaving the next day      The best I have stayed in my life  After leaving my luggage  I went to the beach  where I was assigned a nice sunbed  The sea was great  really warm    I had a burguer for lunch by the pool  It was very tasty and the price was ok     euros   The pool is very nice  cool and confortable  Though it is not deep enough and I felt too observed by    lifeguards When coming back to the room  after spending the day on the beach pool  I was asked by a different butler what time I was planning to leave      I had a shower and watched some TV  When leaving the room  a different butler asked me what time I was planning to leave      I went to have dinner at their big restaurant I forgot the name   lots of delicious options  The arabic sweets are amazing  When I came back  around  AM   I was asked by a different butler what time I was planning to leave      The next day we went to breakfast around  am  And guess what  Butler asked me what time I was leaving again      The breakfast was great  lots of choices  The restaurant was full and we were allocated a place in the spanish restaurant  I came back to my room and checked out  The check out process was slow  but ok  I guess if you stay there many days this would be normal Once we checked out  we went to Al Qasr restaurant  where we left our luggage and received a check out card  We were leaving around  PM  and my girlfriend wanted to go to the turtles in Mina and take some pictures  We walked and passed through the first security check point  A very nice guard offered an Abra  which we refused as it was not needed  In the second check point  we had the point that ruined our DAM stay  A guard refused us entry  I explained we just checked out  showed him my luggage card  and the other guard allowed us through  I asked him to call his superior  which he refused  I was so unhappy   unacceptable in such a  quot high class hotel quot I came back to the previous checkpoint where the other guard told me he was wrong  and as we were guests the previous night  we could go through  He offered me the Abra  which I accepted  It was nice to wave to the guy who just refused me entry    So  bad points  It is unacceptable to have an ex guest treated like you have never been there and ask the same person   times when they are going to leave  How would you feel It is a very beautiful place  lovely rooms  but I hated the ambience  People are always checking things like  quot are you a guest  quot     quot what time you will check out  quot     quot get out of here  you are no longer guest quot   The place is designed for perfection  but it is souless  People are machine trained and do not know how to solve simple issues  Or maybe I was not born for the  quot five star exclusive service quot  I emailed the hotel  they came back with an excuse and saying people would be better trained  What else could I expect     
N =>   Excellent Fantastic You Must go    it was a wedding anniversary trip that we had been really looking forward to all year and it didn t disappoint  As it was our third stay at the Dar Al Masyaf our expectations were very high and from previous holidays visits we were wondering if anything had changed in Dubai due to the economic climate around the world        we had no need to wonder   The service from before we left the UK was excellent  the service and attention to detail during our stay exceeded all our expectations  The staff are efficient  friendly and willing to cater to all your requests they love it when their efforts are appreciated by the guests  If you want a luxury    style hotel then make it here for your holiday destination  The view from our villa out to the ocean was breathtaking and made the holiday even more special   wonderfull room Villa           you can see the Pier Chic and Burj from your window   fantastic   Dubai was just getting started in the tourist industry when we first visited in      and we stayed at the Jumeriah Beach Hotel  then we got married in Dubai in      and stayed at the Burj for our wedding and honeymoon  Each year we go back to Dubai for our wedding anniversary  We have re booked the Dar Al Masyaf three years in a row now which shows that they have definatley got it perfect for us  You must go it s gorgeous  
N =>  a nice time What a fabulous experience  We were lucky to get a upgrade to a Suite which was fantastic  All the staff were highly professional  nothing was too much  This was our  th time in Dubai  stayed previously at Al Qasr and Jumeriah Beach  This was definitely the best  Would highly recommend it for all  
N =>   We loved it My two children wanted to write a review of the hotel so here goes  Megan  aged    I really liked staying at the hotel  It was really fun  Everyone was so kind to us  especially the butlers and the Arbra drivers  I really loved all the food  my favourite restaurant was MJ s and the Chinese William  aged    I had a great holiday  I loved Wild Wadi  My room was great especially when we were upgraded to the suite   I loved it  My favourite restaurant was MJ s and the Pad Thai  Jaya was really kind to me on the Arbra s and a man in MJ s made me a Shirley Temple which was really nice Mum and Dad had a great time as well  The service  food and staff are second to none  The fact that the pool s have life guards looking after the pool allowed us to relax with the children  The whole experience was outstanding and we cannot wait to return next year  I would also particularly like to thank Katherine the Guest Manager who spent so much time and effort making our stay so special  
N =>   Summer offer was worth it  We stayed for a few days in the hotel and availed of their Summer Promotion  where two kids below    years of age stay with parents for free   I have to say that for that rate  it was so worth it  Checking in was a very  very pleasant experience  We were led to the main lobby by a friendly bellboy and was immediately given cool towels to freshen up  From the main lobby  we were directed towards the buggy station to be taken to our room  We were greeted by our private butler for the night  were warmly welcomed  checked in and were led to our room  where refreshing drinks awaited us The private butlers we had throughout our stay were always so friendly and helpful  The wait for the buggy ride is always not more than a   minute wait  The whole Madinat Jumeirah  Mina Salam  Al Qasr  Dar Al Masyaf  Madinat Souk  property is beautiful  During our stay  we tried most of the restaurants in Dar Al Masyaf Al Qasr area and a couple of other restaurants bars in Madinat Souk and they re all basically good The only comment I have is the pool bar in the hotel  We went there to have drinks while watching the sunset but sitting at the bar put us off  alcohol bottles could use some dusting off  plastic cups look so worn out they should be replaced  the bartenders  work area could use some renovation  They look dull and dirty Aside from that observation above  Dar Al Masyaf is worth the experience  
N =>   Charming villas but disappointing service  We toured the area in a buggy from JBH and fell in love with the peaceful setting of the complex  So we decided to make a very bold decision   to change our flights and book a room for one night in Madinet Jumeirah in the last minute  I asked for Mina Salam or Al Qasr but they gave me a villa  No    which I have no complaint on its location   Never thought it would take me   hours to check in  The Emirates in Al Qasr didn t seem to care  amp  chit chatted with each other keeping us waiting      Finally we were taken by a buggy to our villa  We were greeted by a butler   here came the real check in process  He showed us to our room s      right  room quot s quot  where I booked only   for my hubby  amp    young kids  I thought the butler let us choose which room I preferred   one facing the beach and the other facing the backyard  No need to choose  right  The butler said the   rooms were ours  If we closed the main door behind us  the   rooms were actually connected  How nice to pay for   room and get   instead  Thought that was a nice treat during low season  Then we found out that it was a mistake   they charged us for   rooms  a whopping AED      for a night  Once we cleared their mistake  we were given the room facing the backyard  I insisted getting the one facing the beach as they costed the same  amp  the room was obviously available  to us   Butler said no  it was given to another family whom I heard was upgraded  why not us who came earlier  amp  were made such a terrible mistake  Finally  the butler s manager gave us another room which faced the beach     By the time  the sun had set  amp  we still had not had our luggages which was the first thing I urged for sending from JBH  There was no drinking water in our room  amp  at least   lamps did not work  didn t check the others   I called the butler  amp  even the emergency button on the phone  there was no answer     I think I am a city person  I really don t appreciate this kind of  one and only  butler service  We finally headed out to the souk for dinner  amp  ran into the butler  I asked about the AED    credit under the summer promotion program  amp  the butler rest assured us that our room rate came with full breakfast  amp  the credit     I wasn t so sure as breakfast was not included when I booked the room with reservation desk  Anyway  we tried to look for a restaurant where we could use the credit  Before we checked the bill  I called the butler to confirm if there s no mistake  amp  he apologized he was wrong again  Great that I called  so I settled my bill using the Visa     discount instead Nothing he or his manager could do  except to ask me to call the reservation desk again to see if I could change my booking to summer promotion  The girl handling my call acknowledged all the mishappenings  amp  gave me breakfast for free  Perhaps my expectation was too high seeing the complex  but got very disappointed by the poor service  be my butler was a trainee  He definitely needs more training  
N =>   Prepare to be spoilt  This was our  th stay in Dubai  each time having stayed within the Jumeriah Madinet complex    years ago we stayed within the hotel   Al Qasr  and so this time wanted to try the villas   we were not disappointed  We were initially put in villa      which we found was quite a distance from the main pool area  so we asked to be moved  which we were to villa     This was much better and we soon found a short cut to the main hotel  The villa was outstanding  always exceptionally clean  butler service was nice and also the   hour happy hour from    pm  The butler will call a buggy or Abra for you to go anywhere in the complex  I would recommend The Meat Co  restaurant and Beachcombers at Jumeriah Beach Hotel  Also check out the new Dubai Mall and its great aquarium and aquarium zoo This visit we also did a desert safari through Arabian Adventures  It was excellent  very good value for money and great for everyone  dune buggying  bbq  camel rides  henna painting  belly dancer etc  We have stayed at   other hotels in Dubai  including the Burj  and the Dar al saf is by far our favourite  We spent the last   nights of our holiday at the Atlantis   what a mistake  wish we had spent these last   days back at the villas  
N =>   Best Hotel in Dubai   Amazing I am writing this review because this hotel is by far the most amazing place we have ever stayed  My boyfriend and myself work in the travel industry and have stayed in many many hotels but this is by far THE BEST Our first stay was in  of this year in Villa    I think  it was amazing the room was very spacious and the hotel staff and butlers were brilliant  It was so peaceful and relaxing  The beach was like a paradise words cant describe it  Restaurants are great so many to choose from  my favourite PaI Thai As we enjoyed our first stay we returned in e to Villa     I loved this villa it was beautiful and the rooms were even more spacious  The staff were so lovely to me  I was on crutches and couldnt bear the heat too much  so i sat in the Majilas were everyone was so helpful to me  It was also my birthday  the hotel gave me a cake and flowers so thoughtful I Love this hotel so does my boyfriend  we wont stay anywere else in Dubai  we urge everyone else to do the same  We are planning a return visit next month  hoping to stay on the beach this time There is no were else in DUBAI that has a patch on the DAM in the Madinat Jumeirah  
N =>   Out of this world     Absolutely incredible  The Villa was amazing very spacious fabulous bathrooms and balconys  fresh fruit in your room every day The service was second to none the setting was divine  upon reading some of the negative reviews on this place I have to wonder were they staying in the same place I was I have stayed in a lot of top class hotels from The Bay hotel in Cape town to the Prague Mandarin Oriental and WOW this by far outshines them all  The butlers in the villa could not do enough for you  Each evening we enjoyed complimentary drinks in the courtyard  you can choose from a glass of Moet to a bottle of beer  I found walking around the resort any staff member that you pass would warmly greet you  The staff taking you around the resort on the boats were fantastic so friendly  amp  giving us loads of great tips for places to visit  amp  things to do  On the beach you have staff coming around with icepops  iced cucumbers for your eyes and even coming over to spritz us with evian and giving us cool compresses afterwards to refresh Each night you have little gifts left on your bed  from little massage oils  amp  chocolates to a customised map with a jogging route and sweat bands  Unfortunately I did not get a chance to enjoy a spa treatment but we poped in for a visit  amp  were met by a lovely lady that gave us a tour of their world class spa I will definately be returning  amp  trying some of their treatmentsour whole experience was just out of this world  our dining experiences were some of the best we have had in the world   You must try the steakhouse in the resort MJs mouthwatering and just exceptional service The Dal Al Masaf must be one of the best accomodations in the world   it comes down to the amazing setting  exceptional staff and incredible attention to detail  
N =>   beautiful place wonderful stay This resort was truly something  No detail has been overlooked and it is absolutely stunning  Our room was comfortable  luxurious and drop dead gorgeous  One of the greatest assets to staying here was the access to Wild Wadi  the Burj Al Arab  the beach and the pools  As far as restuarants and ammenties    they have everything  My only complaint is that the hotel does everything in its power to get you to stay on the property  While it is lovely and very difficult to pull yourself away from here  we wanted to explore more of Dubai  We felt a little bit pressured to book restaurants on hotel property  While the staff was sweet and courteous  they didn t really know anything about the rest of Dubai  only what the hotel had to offer  so that made it a little tough to get around  Other than that  our stay was glorious and we d love to go back for more relaxation in this beautiful place  
N =>  splendid You can be assured that the hotel exceeds all expectations  Staff food spa all  
N =>  Quality location and service all first class This was our  th visit to the Madinat Jumeirah hotel and our  rd time in the villas  As always the whole experience was very good from the minute we arrived to leaving  The Villas with the on hand butler service make doing anything a breeze  I agree with a previous report that the private pool service was not as good as previous years  but it was still good  Everything else was as good as before  The best bit was you were treated like a returning guest  they had done their homework and welcomed you back  which for such a large hotel was really nice We stayed in villa     two minutes to the beach and we were   steps from patio to pool There are     places to eat  this time we decided to try all new restaurants from our previous trips  Pisces was the best  highly recommended and i would also recommend Segreto  both a reason to dress up  good quality food and wine a place for a special treat  We also dined at MJ s which was a decent steak house The main pool was chilled which in the heat   degs was required but th private pools were quiet and chilled out  I did a bit of both as people watching around the main pool is an interesting way to while away an hour or two We will be back 
N =>   Give the Dar Al Masyaf     again    but only just  Just returned from a    day visit at the DAM with my wife and two children aged    and     which was our   th visit to Jumeirah properties in Dubai in the past   years  Although we were advised by Jumeirah reservations that if we booked direct with them and not through an agent we would def be given a Summer House with a lagoon view  on arrival we were given a room with no view at all  except the branches of a very large tree  Usually we stay in a Gulf view but friends had recommended a lagoon view due to some night timework being done on the beach during the time we were there Initially when I asked to change rooms we were told it was not possible  even though the place was in no way full  and when I asked to speak to the General Manager I was informed that he doesnt speak to guests unless they put it in writing and he will reply in due course     Only when I said I was cancelling my booking and transferring to the Atlantis did Randy a team leader grudgingly and in no way politely offer to move us  in fact the attitude with the staff we encountered in villa    was very poor  it was almost a  quot like it or lump it  quot  attitude which we had never experienced in a Jumeirah hotel before  I have to say the staff  butlers  housekeeping and pool staff at our new room  no    were outstanding and they really looked after us  whith nothing being too much trouble  which was in stark contrast to our welcome to no     The room also had a fantastic view  In summary the resort is still excellent but service standards are obviously slipping quite a bit which wont be helped if management dont want to hear guest feedback unless it is put in writing  Have I been put off the place    yes a bit and to be honest not sure I want to give any company over   grand a year when the management wont speak to me if I have a complaint  Will think seriously whether we stay with Jumeirah on our next trip to Dubai  
N =>   Didn t think it was possible to be better than Mina a Salam Yes it was better but only by the finest of margins  Based on our experiences  I don t think you will be disappointed whichever hotel or villa you stay in within the Madinat complex  Some signs that they were suffering low occupancy levels because of world economy problems  in particular some of the restaurants were pretty quiet  but this had no impact whatsoever on service standards which were as high as ever  The relative weakness of sterling now makes Dubai an expensive holiday  but it s still worth it  when you are in Hotels of this standard  All going well we will be back  
N =>  Stunning in every respect This hotel exceeds all expectations  exquisite throughout  Nothing has been left to chance  the decor  the furnishings  the staff  the food  the service is all second to none  an absolute delight  Expensive but worth every single dirham  
Near perfect We have just returned from nearly   weeks in the gorgeous resort of Jumeirah Dubai We went to Dubai with an open mind really expecting building work all around us and service not actually up to the hype We were truly very pleasantly surprised The summerhouses we stayed in are part of the Jumeirah resort and possibly one of the nicest parts Our summerhouse was private and secluded and they all have a little private courtyard in the middle of   rooms  All the rooms are serviced by a butler who is in the little reception area    hours a day and who will sort anything out for you  They were always incredibly courteous and helpful At  pm we would sit outside in the courtyard for our  quot happy hour quot  where drinks were served for   hours  complimentary The whole resort is serviced by buggies and abrhas little boats  and makes getting around easy and enjoyable Our room was spacious enough for   adults and       year olds but I think the sofa bed is not ideal for anyone older and Im not surprised children older than    have to be accommodated in another room The huge bathroom though meant that the room actually felt more spacious than it probably was It was lovely I loved the beach area and there was always plenty of staff to help you settle comfortably on the beach wherever you wanted to be  The advantage of the arabian summerhouses was that after a day on the beach   or wild wadi   complimentary to all guests at Jumeirah  we could chill out in the private pool area next to our summerhouse    shared with   others   This is particularly good for families with young children  There are lifeguards everywhere including at the private villa pools I was impressed with the excellent way ALL the staff had been trained to be of an exceptional standard of efficiency and politeness  Nothing was ever too much trouble and we were always greeted with courteousness and a smile I loved the harmonious mix of races both staff and guests Wild wadi water park is great for the kids and because it is included in your stay you can go as many times as you want  We went many times  just for a couple of hours I was truly impressed how immaculate and clean it was  Again the staff were fantastic and lifeguards were everywhere  always with a smile  Everyone we met  staff  asked us always  how are you The restaurants at Jumeirah are all very good and not as expensive as we had been led to believe  The worst experience was at the Burj al Arab where we were made to feel very unwelcome  My    year old son  as smart as he was  was almost not let in to the restaurant because he didn t have closed shoes  While I agree with a sensible dress code  I was disgusted at the way we were made to feel inadequate  When we pointed out he was    they said OK  Our bill was      so we were not exactly ruffians coming off the beach The restaurant staff were very rude All the other restaurants were great with the children I wouldnt recommend the restaurants in the souk madinat  These are not run by Jumeirah and you can tell  They are not good and the staff are totally different As for the building work  we had none near us unless you count  quot the Palm quot  in the distance Dubai is not a beautiful place  its like canary wharf   but the beach resorts are excellent We all had a fantastic holiday and I would say it caters for all ages and all expectations We will be back  
N =>   Too remote Stayed here one night before asking to move to a   bedroom suite in Al Qasr  separate review  The room was ok but somewhat sterile and not very comfortable  However  the bathroom was very nice and modern with a huge bathtub  The seaview consisted of palms directly outside the balcony which totally obstructed any view of the beach at all  We also found the villas to be too remote form the rest of the Madinat complex  We didn t stay long enough to comment further  
N =>  Fantastic breathtaking Beautiful perfect relaxing holiday We visited Al Qsar in ch     t         this year we are going to stay in one of the Summerhouses with Private Butler so on my return in y I will endevour to make a review Al qsarEverytime it takes my breath away  fantastic service   when we arrived we were shown to our room  which was lovely  but having been before I knew exactly the location of room I wanted   within    minutes we had the room of Our choice  we tried to request this before but was informed this was not possible The Fish restaraunt Pierichi is to die for if you like beautifully presented and mouth watering tasting food then this is a must  It is a little pricey but we feel well worth it  you may even see a celebritiy or two The restaraunts in and around the Al qsar are of very high standard so expect to pay a little more but you can also eat in one of the many restaraunts in the souk which offer many price ranges  maybe a quick pizza or a steak in the streak house  or even in the noodle bar  whatever your palate there will be something for you over all one of the nicest places I have been toLuxury at it s best 
N =>   Idyllic exquisite and nearly faultless This   night stay at the Dar al Masyaf was the third trip to Dubai for my husband and myself  Our previous holidays were taken with our children and we stayed at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in ruary      and at the Al Qasr in ober      Our Virgin flight landed at  am on Thursday  traffic to the DAM was fairly light and our taxi cost    AED  We checked in and were offered immediate availability in ground floor Arabian Deluxe summer house in Villa     I had emailed requesting an upper floor room in Villa        or       which had been noted on our booking but having been offered such an early check in we decided to view and accept the available room which was beautiful  with a secluded outlook  but very dark inside due to the amount of overhanging foliage  If we had been checking in later in the day I would probably have asked to see a different villa but we were very grateful for the early check in and decided that the bonus of having use of our room for a full day was a blessing too good to turn down Room service was discreet and faultless throughout our stay  Butler service was less impressive overall particularly during happy hour when we had to replenish our own glasses a couple of times and on one occasion we had to wait for more wine to be delivered to the Villa because there was no white wine left  not due to our personal consumption I hasten to add  and both on this evening and one other the white wine was not chilled  This inconsistent service was a disappointment to us because otherwise the Villa courtyard is a peaceful and relaxing venue to enjoy a glass or two of wine before leaving for dinner  We enjoyed chatting with a couple of our Butlers during our stay but did find the turnover of Butler staff more frequent than anticipated  As a general comment all the staff at the Madinat Jumeirah hotels including Abra and buggy drivers  waiting staff etc were  without exception  polite and friendly Of the five nights of our stay we only ate twice  onsite   On our first evening we took an Abra to the Souk to dine at P Squared the brasserie above Pisces Restaurant  Unfortunately this did not turn out to be the experience I had anticipated as the upper terrace was closed and P Squared diners were instead accommodated inside Pisces at the back of the restaurant to the far right   Food service was a little slow and a table of neighbouring diners were heartily complaining that the desert wine they had requested had still not arrived    minutes after ordering  Whilst our meal was absolutely delicious I did feel like we were  second rate  diners for chosing from the PSq menu  Our bill was AED     which included two main courses and two glasses of water  We also ate quayside at the Souk one evening at Left Bank which is not a Jumeirah restaurant  The bar inside is funky and outside dining by the waterside is just lovely  Our meals were very good and I would certainly eat there again  total bill was AED     for   cocktail    non alcoholic cocktail    main courses and   side salad   There really are so many restaurants by the beautiful waterside at the Madinat Souk to choose from but be aware that everywhere is very busy  Our other meals were taken at Certos at the Radisson Hotel Media City  Latino House at Al ooj Rotana which are both highly recommended and in an Italian restaurant on Jumeirah Beach Walk  Jumeirah owned Restaurants around the resort can be extremely expensive but it is also possible to enjoy fabulous dining at a more reasonable price by researching restaurants before or after you arrive We took a taxi ride to Atlantis one morning  AED     for a chance to see the Palm and the hotel  We have previously stayed at Atlantis in the Bahamas and were interested to compare the shiny new Dubai version but as we were not paying guests nor Aquaventure customers we found that we had very limited access and we were not really able to see much of the hotel at all  We did  however  enjoy the  free view  Aquarium in The Avenues and contemplated paying to go in The Lost Chambers  which was a reasonable price although I can t recall how much  but decided to get back out in the sunshine and took a taxi to ina Walk instead  The whole ina development just took my breath away  I am totally astounded at just how much building has been accomplished since we were last in Dubai in       The ina development site Media City The Palm etc is just so much more vast than I had imagined  ina Walk set amidst the sky scrapers and construction is pleasant oasis and we stopped to have a coffee and to gawp at the yachts  There is a dhow cruise available from here In summary we love the setting  luxury and privacy of the Dar al Masyaf and would highly recommend the hotel and Madinat Jumeirah resort as a whole  Enjoy your stay  
N =>   Just Disappointing We returned to this hotel after   years  in between staying at Royal Mirage  The wow factor seemed to be missing and the buzz not there We chose DAM over the rest of the hotel because we felt it offered something extra but I am not sure we were right  The Butler service was unattentive and particularly focussed on the massive Russian contingent which fills the hotels The main gripe is the price of alcohol and particularly wine  I understand the tax that all hotels are subjected to but to have to pay a minimum of     for a bottle of below average wine just spoils the experience  Our favourite champagne Billecart Salmaon which costs between     and     in London restaurants was      at the hotel restaurants  Dubai wants tourists but this will put even the wealthy off If we go to Dubai with the children next month I may just return to the Royal Mirage as the welcome is guaranteed  
N =>   Dar al Masyaf Simply Beautiful Having reviewed all three of the accomadaition options at Madinat Jumeirah  me and my partner initially had booked a room at Mina Salaam  However  upon arrival we were notified that the room was unavailaible  I was slightly dissapointed as we had our heart set on Mina Salaam  But this initial dissapointment had soon turned into joy when the receptionist had offered to upgrade us a villa at Dar Al Masyaf  We were soon whisked off on a Abra  Water Taxi  soaking up the beautiful sights the complex had to offer  When we arrived at our villa  no      we were greeted by a butler and shown to our rooms  The room was basked with rich Arabian decor  golds and dark browns  which was bubbling with an aromatic  refeshing Arabian scent  The bed was large and inviting with a wonderfull array of pillows  The bathroom was spotlessly clean  and the walk in shower was one of the best i have ever experienced  we could not have asked for more  Briefly summing it up The Villas were perfectly located  isolated from theMain Hotels Al Qasr and Mina Salaam  but being a stones throw away  it boasted its own reasonably sized private pool  which was always watched over by a lifegaurd  The breakfast selection was vast and incredibly yummy at all   breakfast locations Dining options were endless  of high quality but can be extortionatly priced  MJ s Steak House was soo Good we went twice   Shimmers is also a nice beach reastauraunt we happened to stumble across one evening when we went for stroll on the private beach  There are so many other dining options availaible which means it will cater for everyones tastes The service was supreme The whole place was spotlessly clean and well maintained  The whole complex it is located in Madinat Jumeirah is just stunningI could write pages and pages about how excellent this hotel was    But i would rather you go find out for yourself  Will i go back if i ever get the chance  you bet                         
N =>   The best hotel in Dubai by far  We stayed here for   nights as part of our honeymoon in y       Even though it was above    degrees celsius each day  this hotel totally made it bearable  The massive pool was amazing  as was the pool bar  The hotel souk was fantastic   so many restaurants  I think the hotel has    in total  and some great shops It was great traveling around the hotel by golf buggy or boat   always a fun thing to do  The staff were lovely and there was always a different part of the hotel to explore due to its sheer size  You could never venture out of the hotel and still have so much to do The spa was amazing  definitely worth booking a massage or facial Now on to the room   our private villa had an amazing private pool  an our butler was lovely   made sure he booked all our tours and restaurant reservations  The complimentary afternoon drinks served by your butler was also a lovely touch  The room itself was so huge and full of all the necessary amenities   including huge shower and separate bathtub Free entry into the Wild Wadi Water Park was fun   especially as you get driven there in a golf buggy  The beach was lovely as well   a little hot but well worth it  We also had dinner on the top floor  observation deck restaurant  of the Burj al Arab hotel   the food was ok  probably not worth the inflated prices  but a definite must if you are traveling to Dubai  just so you can say you experienced the only   star hotel in the world  or so they say  Also have to mention that the desert safari and ski Dubai are also must do s in Dubai   a little cheesy but where else can you experience these types of things To sum up   if you are traveling to Dubai  don t waste your time looking at other hotels  this is the one   it s over the top and extremely luxurious  and therefore totally Dubai  
New Year in Paradise Its is a return visit to this beautiful resort and we choose for New Year a quite Dar al Masyaf Villa     This one is a little of the beach action with a private pool and Pai Thia restaurant right next to you  We skipped the galadinner and selected Shimmers beach restaurant to celebrate      smart casual right on the beach  It was fantastic and a time to remember  
N =>   Just what we wanted My husband and I stayed at the Dar al Masyaf on our first visit to Dubai  and we were very pleased with our choice  Our stay was only for a few days stopover on the way to the Maldives  though it was a lovely start to our holiday We don t usually opt for the  big  resorts  though seeing as we were going to Dubai  we thought that this was going to be difficult to avoid  We booked an Arabian suite at the Dar al Masyaf  and were upgraded to a Ocean suite   the rooms are lovely  with fab bathrooms and a great view of the Burj The staff were superb  both friendly and helpful  so we couldn t have asked for anything more  I m not sure we would want to stay in such a large sprawling resort for a longer holiday  but as a stopover for a few days  it was perfect  
N =>  Simply the best We spent   nights at DAM  my brother s family  amp  mine The whole experience is world class  Arrival at Hotel  chilled watermelon juice  cold towels  golf buggy to villa  butler greeting  amp  the villas  WOW  We were offered an upgrade of    AED  approx       per night to ocean inter connecting villas suites  Perfect for our two families to close the outside door  amp  let the kids go between our rooms  Bathrooms are as big as the bedrooms Water taxis  amp  golf buggies are great fun way to get to restaurants  booked with a smile by the butlers   amp  the vast facilities offered by this complex  Butler arranged buggy to Wild Wadi  free admission  amp  entrance via JB Hotel Restaurants   MJs  try the Chateaubiand  Thai  Morrocan  Spanish Tapas  amp  Noodle Bar all fantastic but the weak pound means the bill leaves a bitter taste  Wine is extortionate  so take advantage of the free drinks    pm at your Villa Reception  then sip slowly at dinner  If you want a luxury break  with fantastic service  amp  food  The DAM is simply the best  even better IMO than Le Royal Meridien where we have stayed twice before  We all really look forward to going back  the experience makes you feel really special  
N =>    rd time back to this fab location   We returned back to these gorgeous villas tember      for our third visit back  and again was not disappointed in the slightest Our room this year was the best ever  an upstairs villa with waterways balcony that had a fantastic view of the Burj  Its so peaceful to have a waterways balcony where you can just chill out in the sun the Staff again were excellent and very helpful when we were asking about booking reservations  they were able to print us out menus on request which was very helpfulOur room was always cleaned to excellent standards and the staff didn t hesitate in getting us extra towels and face clothes etc when we asked The only small problem we had was with breakfast one morning when we decided to order it to our room It took a bit of time to come and a few things that we asked for were missing so I had to ring up to ask for them again However  they did still come and we actually got a plate of chocolates that evening to apologise for the delay  which was really nice This place is still our favourite and I don t think that will ever change Its just so nice to be a relaxing and luxurious hotel where you get spoiled by the staff  coming round with cold towels  cleaning your sunglasses on the beach and coming round with fruit As we stayed in tember this year  Ramadan was on during on stay  which to be honest didn t make much difference to us  We didn t really have to do anything differently  maybe just putting our drink in our bags when walking around the mall but that was about it Obviously you couldn t have alcoholic drinks on the beach during daytime hours but the free bar in our villa during   PM definitely made up for that    the staff aren t shy at all with the drinks and its kinda unlimited flowing spirits and wine so definitely make the most it   We went to some great restaurants such as Mj s within the Al Qasr  and the food was great we were celebrating my parents wedding anniversary and asked if the restaurant could do something special for them  and at the end of the meal the waiters came out with a gorgeous little cake and candle and a  Happy Anniversary  chocolate plaque  It was lovely and the atmosphere in there was great with again really helpful staff  couldn t fault it at all On the end of our stay  we decided to book a taxi from the hotel concierge to take us to the airport the following morning Again Check out was fine and all our luggage was transferred for us  However when waiting for the taxi we were getting a bit concerned for time  we checked with the concierge and they unfortunately had no trace of the booking which was disappointing  but the look on our face must have said it all and we were offered a free lift in one of the hotel cars to the airportwhich we definitely weren t gonna refuse       it was a relaxing ride again to the airport and we were sad to be leaving again Hopefully we will be back to stay again in a year or so  cant wait already    
N =>  Location    good Facilities    nice price    too much serice      Well  I booked my self and the family with kids in the Arabian Villas  airport pickup on time  but once we arrived  the checkin process was a nightmare  first I was told they didn t know I was coming   daa   how was I pickedip from airport    then I was given a room that was not cleaned  then I was told I was givern the wrong room and I have to change to add to my nightmare  my wife got really sick just after our arrival and we had to call for the in hotel doctor  the first point that was brought in the discussion was the price of treatment    in the mist of this situation for the second time  someone came and told me we have to change our room as they made a mistake giving me this room  I really gave it to them  and talked to the manager in charge  It was obvious that they were trying to help but they were not sincere  once the dust settled and my wife got better we started to enjoy  I started to look around for what is the problem in this resort  and it was obvious  the staff are not well trained  the level of service is really different from one person to another  there is an army of peaple but really few who know the service as we want it Also I have used their Talise SPA  very pretentious  it looks like a spa you would enjoy  but it is not  untrained staff  very pricey even compared to europe prices  In summary  I will never come to this resort EVER  I will not Recommend it to Any one EVER  I will make sure every one I know doesnot Stay at this resort Ever in case you want to know why  Price too Much       USD is alot  Service  only   r   out of    are good at service  I am sure in dubai you will find much better deals  and jummariah group  you need to change your selling line from stay different to stay at a different place    
N =>  Not worthy of   Stars nor the price tag  This hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in  We arrived here          after a truly fab time in the Maldives only to find out our rooms were not ready  because a local Diplomat was late checking out   We were offered a meal that night as compensation but when we tried to book  literally ALL the restaurants in The Madinat were full  So we were offered room service  which arrived after an hour s wait and the order was wrong by which time our   year old son had fallen asleep Breakfast the next morning was like a  quot bun fight quot  with an unbelievable level of noise and chaos in the restaurant  The beach wasn t much better and full of Russian s In our room the balcony light did not work  a lamp in the room had blown  we could not get all channels on the tv and many of the products were missing from the bathroom  We ofcourse complained and people scurried around but it was all just a bit too late  We hated the hotel so much that we departed Dubai early on          We have stayed at some truly amazing hotels and locations all over the world and were underwhelmed to say the least by the attempts of The Jumeriah Group  
N =>  paradise My daughter and myself stayed in a arabian de luxe summer house  Our room was absolutely magnificent There was a swimming pool to each summer house and each summer house consists of    rooms  Most days there was just the   of us at the pool  The service round the pool and room service was fantastic Towels round the pool were provided no matter how many you used this was nit a problem The whole of the resort was paradise it was surrounded by waterways and no matter where you wanted to go your butler got you a golf buggy to take you or you waited a couple of minutes for an abra The restaurants were expensive but well worth the money There are   other hotels on the resort and also a souk I will definately stay at this resort again  
N =>   A perfect holiday Having stayed in Al Qasr we had wondered whether we should return there but then decided to try the villas  We were so pleased we did I had contacted the resort before arriving with a request for a first floor room  We arrived about  am and the butler showed us to our requested room  I was disappointed to see that it was on the ground floor but in Dubai the ground floor is the first floor  We were offered a change the next day but the following morning we were told it would be three days and we had already decided that in daylight our room and terrace were great The room was lovely and had a small terrace which overlooked the waterway and Pai Thai  It was quite private and was great for sitting out with your morning cup of tea  Sitting there every morning with the abras quietly passing by and only the sound of birds singing  it was difficult to believe that you re supposed to be in the world s biggest building site  Luckily though  Madinat is away from all of the construction work The bathrooms are as great as everyone says  They re huge and very well equipped The butlers are great too  The ones that stood out for us were Lex and Caje  They were really helpful and recommended restaurants and made the reservations for us The small pool by the villa wasn t that well used on some of the    days were there but on a few  it was full  You get the same great service by this pool as you would on the beach We had breakfast in Khymat Al Bahar every day and after a few days the receptionist was referring to us by our names before we d even checked in  Breakfast was great with a huge choice  I defy anyone to say there s nothing to eat there The resort was fully booked but you still didn t have to queue  hang around or wait long to get served anywhere The maid had a great sense of humour  leaving us animals made out of towels when she turned down the beds at night  The other nice touch was to leave different items every night rather than the predictable chocolate  We got lip balm  massage oil  foot spray and the odd chocolate We had fourteen days of unadulterated luxury and each time we go to Dubai  we wonder if it will be our last  We think the magic will disappear  Staying at Dar has made us realise that holidays don t get any better than this so we re already discussing next year with our travel agent  
N =>   absolute bliss This was our first visit to this resort after staying in the Jebel Ali resort on our previous visits to Dubai and after half a day in the resort we where wondering what we had been doing all this time going to that hotel  This place has got to be the best hotel that we have ever stayed in   We stayed in villa    where we had a short walk to the pool which was very quiet with at most   or   people round it but on most days only about   which was fantastic when you are going for a relaxing break  The service round the pool from the pool butler was fantastic  always round with drinks  cold towels  pineapple skewers and believe it or not cleaning your sunglasses  We thought that we had been taken to the wrong hotel for the price of the holiday  The villa was superb  a good sized lounge bedroom with a double king sized bed and sofa area  The bathroom was the same size as the other room with separate bath and shower wet room and his and hers basins  There was also a balcony looking out onto the gardens  The room was spotlessly clean as it was serviced in the morning and also in the evening when the bed was turned down  In the evening we would come back to the room to find a origami towel in the shape of a different animal left on the bed along with a wee chocolate  On booking this holiday we where a bit apprehensive about the private butler service but I have to say that they where fantastic  They left you alone and did not bug you but it was good to have them there to book restaurant tables and spa sessions  They also arranged buggys to pick you up and take you round the resort  In the evening between   and   they also hosted a  happy hour  drink in the reception of the villa where you got a chance to meet the other guests staying in the villa which was a nice touch  It was even nicer when the drinks are free   The resort has a wide selection of bars and restaurants  around    in total which where of a very high standard  Some of the more popular ones you had to book through the butlers in advance  I would highly recomend MJs steakhouse and Zheng He s and the noodle house in the souk  Overall a excellent resort which I can see us going back to time and time again if only just to get round and try all of the restaurants  I would recomend this resort to anyone as it has to be the bet I have ever seen  FIVE STARS      
N =>   Better than ever Having stayed last tember for a week to celebrate my husbands   th birthday and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves  it was my turn this year  Where should we go  There was only one option   to go back to the Dar and we were not dissappointed  Had a lovely room overlooking the waterways in Villa     which was bigger that last year  The bed was  foot wide and the most comfortable you could ever sleep in  Having been previously we did not go to the buffet dinner but had meals in the souk  MJ s steakhouse  very good  and Segrato  Italian  very nice  Made the most of the free drinks between      pm  Moet is not always display but just ask and it appears  Alcohol is expensive but you have the choice whether to pay for it or not  Was alot busier than last year though it was Ramadam last year and there were alot more children around probably due to the Spring bank holiday finishing  Had complementary free access to Wild Wadi which was good especially when you see how much it usually is to get in  The beach is lovely though towards the Mina is better if you dont like stones shells under your feet whilst paddling  No construction sites close which is a real bonus Would we go back again   definately and hopefully next year  
N =>   This place is truy fantastic Had previously visited Dubai   times and had always stayed at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  which is an outstanding resort hotel  which our   children aged    and   think is absolutely great  In  we decided to book a last minute week away and was really disappointed that the JBH was fully booked  We had already booked flights with BA who had a special e offer on flights to Dubai and managed to get a great bargain of   direct flights for      including taxes  We booked the only   star beach hotel that was available and ended up with a Gulf ocean view Summerhouse at Dar Al Masyaf for the week for        which was far less than we usually pay at JBH and even had complimentary entrance to Wild Wadi thrown in  Considering we had paid a lot less than usual we expected it to be below the standard we had previously enjoyed and would have been ok with that  WOW how wrong could we have been  We arrived at reception at   am and expected to wait until mid afternoon for our villa but was pleasantly surprised to be told that it was ready  When Steph  one of our   fantastic butlers  who  between them work around the clock  showed us our villa to say I was shocked was an understatement  it was so spacious with plenty of room for us    luxuriously furnished and the enormous bathroom and dressing area put the JBH to shame  From our patio we had a fantastic view of the ocean and the Burj al Arab  and was where we used to sit with our complimentry pre dinner Moet each evening  The location of our villa  no    was also perfect for us as we were close to Sinbads kids club  the main  enormous  pool and the retaurant where they served breakfast  and I would suggest that anyone who wants a more private secluded villa should request nos    to     whilst those with children would be best with nos   to    Our butlers could not have been more helpful and truly added to the whole experience and ambiance  We are already looking to go back later in the year and cant imagine staying in the JBH again after staying at Dar Al Masyaf and even the children agree with me   which is a first      
N =>   A great end to a great trip  Superb all round      though needs a polish   Okay so this was the final stage in a trip from Korea  japan and then onto dubai for   nights We arrived at  am  we knew the check in was going to be  pm  the hotel is pretty much full at this time of year    the heat hit us like a spade at the airport  The transfer time took about   mins  white lexus  nice    and we arrived at the Al Qasar main entrance  the first thing that hits you is the sheer scale and opulence of it all  we were shown to a side reception room and checked in  told our room was not ready and we would be offered a lounge  refreshments and a shower whilst we waited  we were also able to use any of the resorts facilities until the rooms was ready We had a few oj s and some water and the room we sat in is basically a lounge area with reclinig chairs   its airconned to the max  they offer blankets etc massage all very nice We went for a look around  despite the searing heat   had a few coffees a snooze and few smokes etc and eventually at about midday our villa  No    at the Dar Al Masyaf  was ready  we were shown to a golf buggy and taken through the grounds Am going to cut a long story shory here because this is the one place that lives up to and exceeds the brochures  in most ways   the villas are in a word  stunning  loads of room  ours overlooked the waterways with fishes  crabs  cuttlefish  sometimes   etc  you have your own butler ours varied between Anton  whos grasp of english was poor  nearly as bad as my serbian  and had the sense of humour of a moth and a charisma bypass   sorry mate but wet fish springs to mind   and Caroline and Emo  sorry bad spelling  who couldnt do enough to help   the only thing we ever really requested was to change some travellers cheques    The whole complex is stunning  the weather was very kind to us  the sea was very choppy on a few days  price wise  we were half board and the buffet  although a maginificient selection  didnt get changed in the   nights we were there which was a bit boring to be honest  though there arer plenty of fabulous eateries on the resort including a fabulous costa coffee   a must whilst waiting for your room to be ready    plus the kids running about and people in beachwear and pushing prams etc tended to subtract from the ambience plus the charge of    for a bottle of evian with the meal was taking the michael a bit Breakfast was great  superb choice  we went to shimmers on the beach and also the Thai restaraunt for my birthday  had choc cake and red roses in room from villa staff     which although fairly expensive  about     a head without drinks  was indeed a superb all round experience We ventured into the Mina A Salam and it to be honest was not our thing  felt more Menorca then Middle east and more Lanzarote than luxurious  it really needs a polish as its brining the other two properties down a bit  but again thats my own opinion So all in all            rooms great  expect to pay but then you pay for what you get  some prices are well over inflated  we have stayed in the shangri la in borneo where they charged    for a water   by anyones standards  service superb at times and very occasioanally a let down Attention to detail exceptional  Clientele variable                  from D amp G  to Leeds Chest Tatoos Have fun We did And yes we would go back Cjx 
N =>   Luxury everywhere you look The Villas at Dar Al Masyaf  Madinat Jumeirah were  as expected  opulent and luxurious  I was only there for   nights for work and would have much preferred to be enjoying this villa with my girlfriend but who is one to complain The minute I arrived I knew I was going to enjoy it  Off the plan at  am in the sunshine after leaving rainy cold London the night before it was just what the doctor ordered  After arriving a reception a gondola soon transported me to my villa along the Venice style canals  The room was beautiful and the check in was effortless    The gentleman who checked me in was Thai so I think kind service is in his blood  This would be a great place to take a family if you could afford it as there was a young kid hanging around who had obviously bonded with the villa butler who was entertaining him The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom huge  The shower had his and her products    I didn t realise I I needed different soap  shampoo  conditioner etc but I guess there is a difference Anyway room service was quick  anything I wanted the butler would deliver or find for me    It was a great place to stay  even for work    
N =>  Wonderful Hotel  My husband and I stayed at this hotel last ember for the Dubai Film Festival  We stayed in Villa     The butler staff were great  especially Pasha who took very good care of us  We loved the quiet peace of the complex  Riding on the little boats from place to place was terrific  but my favorite was just walking through the resort  My favorite time of day there was just around sunrise  I walked to the beach and pretty much had the place to myself  Great place to find small seashells  it was very relaxing I also loved watching the changing colours of the Burj at night As we were there for the film fest  it was very busy with very little quiet time  but we found the private pools to be very relaxing  The temperature was pleasant  but the mornings were a little foggy  typical for that time of year  but made eating in the outdoor buffet for breakfast a little cool without a sweater The pool was sensational  The steakhouse at the Al Qassar  can t remember the name   was very good  the other steakhouse in the market place was quite good  as well  We had room service one evening when our jetlag got the better of us  and the quality and quantity were very good  We shared one meal  Simple comfort food  spaghetti bolognese with a side salad  Delicious  We took a day trip to go snorkeling over in Oman and it was very good as well  I would have packed some snacks and food  though  as they did not provide anything substantial  That was our fault  though  not the dive expedition  The waters weren t as clear as we d hoped  but we did see a few new fish we had never seen before cuttle fish  many good sightings of turtles  We had   stops  Altogether  it was a very long day about    hours from pick up to drop off  We were happy to do it  but the trip was very long and decided once was enough I would recommend this hotel for people who really want an escape and stay in a self contained resort  The giant Mall of the Emirates is very close by  and that was a nice diversion as well  If you get an opportunity to go inside the iconic Burj Al Arab  do so  it really defies description  
N =>   fab  what can i say about this hotel  everying was amazing from the moment i arrived  we stayed in a lovely villa with a gorgeous view of the waterways  the bulter we had was vey helpful and made reservations for at the restaurants in the resort evey night  i enjoyed the boat ride to the pool everyday but also loved the mini pool that we had aound the villa which was empty nearly everyday overall we had a fab time and cant wait to go back in june 
N =>  hopeless management beautiful rooms worth the price   I was so excited about staying here after reading the reviews and looking at the pictures on line  Despite what would amount to almost       a night I thought it would be a wonderful treat  Boy was I wrong   My husband  son and I arrived early at  am and I did have hopes that we might get our room ahead of time  but understood when that was not possible  Having flown all night from Europe we decided to have breakfast and then rest  sleep  out by the beach  Several times we called reception to check on our room  they never offered us a phone despite having them in the business center we learned later  and they could never quite tell us when the room would be ready  They kept saying  quot soon quot  so instead of hitting the mall we waited really wanting to shower and change first  Finally at  pm exhausted and rather hot we went back to the reception  The guy there would not tell us anything and finally after another    minutes someone came and told us that our reservation would not be honored    Turns out they overbooked the Dar Villas     They had my reservation and they agreed that I d made it months in advance  They even agreed that I had confirmed my reservation by email three times and by phone to check on something  They knew there was a problem since we arrived in the am  but no one wanted to tell us so they let us wait all day So     instead of giving us the special Dar villa I booked for four nights they offered us the villa for two nights and then  quot an upgrade quot   executive room with ocean view  at the Mina for the last two nights  I was so upset    if I had wanted to stay at the Mina I would have booked the Mina  The only excuse they had for the problem was that some big group  who they admitted booked after us   needed all of the villas thus we had to be bumped  So much for the little guy    After much complaining both about wasting the day waiting for word on our room and about being bumped  we finally had no other choice but to agree and off we went to our room   They did give us a free dinner as compensation but if it was just about the money I could have saved money by booking a cheaper hotel in the first place     Anyway we made it to the room and at first they gave us a ground floor room even though I had asked when I made the reservation for an upper room  Not a big deal but I thought maybe they would make an effort given the reservation problem  After mentioning it  they finally gave us an upper room and we rested while waiting another    minutes for our bags to follow    About the room     I admit it was awesome  We just loved it  The villas are wonderful   quiet  private and spacious  It is close to the spa and the private pools are just perfect  Just as I was about to relax the doorbell rang and in came the butler with the check in forms to sign  He walked right over and handed it to my husband  The check in form of course had the price of the hotel on it  Now this might not be a big issue EXCEPT that I had called the hotel twice to try and prepay the room as a surprise to my husband   He enjoys these things so much less when he knows the cost   During my two lengthy phone calls the hotel told me I could not prepay the room  despite doing so at the Kempinsky in Zurich and the Baur au Lac in Genvea during the same vacation    Anyway at the end of my call the hotel assured me that they would make a note in their system so that I could pay the bill quietly upon arrival without my husband s input  Needless to say that did not work out since the butler handed the bill to my husband   It is a small thing of no real significance  but you d think for the price of the hotel and after the problem with the room that they would get that right     It is a five star hotel that prides itself on service afterall   That evening we went to the mall and had a nice time  I have to admit that since we d been so upset about everything I kinda expected the hotel to have something nice in our room upon our return as an apology  a bottle of wine or maybe a nice letter  but of course there was nothing  The next day I found my mood souring as I thought of packing up and leaving our wonderful villa  we had so many bags     so I finally asked for a higher level manager and explained my unhappiness  She was nice  but we still had to move When we moved to the Mina I was so disappointed  The room was much smaller than the Dar villa and despite their promise we did not have an ocean view  Whereas in the Dar villa we ordered breakfast in the room each day and sat overlooking the canal with the birds singing  in the Mina our room overlooked someone s small house and their garage  The only sound we heard was the road noise  Basically after that we tried to spend as little time as possible in the room  or at the pool as the Mina pool was crowded unlike the private Dar villa pool    To make a long story short    the hotel seems to care very little about customer satisfaction  They did not try very hard to give us the experience we thought we were paying for  If you have to bump someone   then move them into a nicer room not a smaller one with no view  And don t try to make it sound like an upgrade just because it includes the free breakfast as part of the excutive wing  which was looking a little run down and was noisy since it is right off the main lobby    Would I go back  If I could be assured of getting the room I booked at the Dar villa then yes  However  frankly I am not sure I have any confidence that this would happen  I want to go back to Dubai with my mom in a few months and am just not sure I should give them my business again     
N =>   Beautiful hotel chaotic service This is a beautiful hotel marred by shambolic service  I stayed here twice in one week   with a night in between at a hotel in the desert  First check in we arrived off a flight from UK at around   pm to be told room would not be ready until   pm  Fair enough  We asked our bags to be sent to the room of some friends who had arrived the day before  Despite several phone calls and cajoling it took nearly two hours for the bags to be sent   The next check in was worse  Reckoning that we would not be able to get our room until   pm we delayed our departuere from the desert hotel and got to the Dar El M at   pm   to be told our rooms were not ready  Big argument  Six hopeless staff poring over a computer screen trying to work out what rooms were where  Eventually a more senior manager upgraded us and found us rooms immediately  I reckon there were dozens of rooms spare but the junior staff had no authority to upgrade  They simply couldn t think for themselves  The Jumeirah group make a big thing of staff smiling at the punters but perhaps they could do more to train them to think for themselves  Once in the room   rathe rheavy decor  distressed fake antique heavy brown furniture knocked up in India and made to look quite grand but really quite comfortable   all was fine  The butler service worked well and some nice complimentary Moet in the evening  We were Impressed that they did not produce some cheaper champagne nobody has heard of  Great Uzbekistani butler called Anton who should be made manager of the whole hotel  One of the few staff members who you felt was in control  Lovely pool  virtually to ourselves  Extremely clean and tidy  But beware the spa  Very expensive        massages   and not awfully good  Restaurants also hideously expensive  Expect London prices and the rest  Avoid the Italian restaurant  The Thai isn t too bad but don t expect a culinary wow  
N =>   Amazing We didn t get off to a great start as we arrived early and were put in a waiting type room which did not have a refreshments or working tv and there were only seats  We waited for ages and were finally told that our room was ready  When we saw our room it made up for having to wait a while  The room was really big with seating area  massive bed and the bathroom was almost as big as the room  complete with walk in rain shower  bath and twin sink  In each of the summerhouses is a lobby area with a butler  Ours was so friendly and each evening there was an hour of free drinks  including free champagne   in the lobby  It was extremely hot in the august that we stayed there and it was such a nice relief whenever we came back to a fully air  conditioned lobby with really calming music  We really felt like we were in paradise  Golf buggys were such a great help as the grounds are extensive and on the whole we preferred these to the abras  water boats  as they were faster and we found the abras to unbearable in the heat  Unfortunately having stayed there in august  it did mean that we were limited in the activities we could do as it was too hot for the sand safari and camel riding  Obviously this was not the hotels fault but i would recommend going in a slightly cooler time to allow you to do these activities  There were so many great restaurants in the hotel complex although they were not that cheap  I would definately recommend La Parilla restaurant in the jumeirah beach hotel which is only   minutes away by buggy as the entertainment and whole atmosphere was great  They had amazing steaks which were very expensive but worth it  This was our first time in Dubai and if we came back we would DEFINATELY come to this hotel  Great sevice  great facilties  great food  great rooms  Everything was GREAT    
N =>   Fantastic It s taken me a while to get around to writing this review  but we stayed at Dar for our honeymoon in y and it was fantastic  Totally disneyland   Vegas but also very private and romantic  You were completely peaceful and relaxed and then just arounfdthe corner is the crazyness of Al Qasr pool  restaurants etc  We had a Gulf Summer House with a private pool just outside  which was always very quiet  Wild Wadi was great if you re into that sorta thing  It was hot in y but we re used to visiting Vegas so it wasn t a problem for us Room was amazing  Huge  with a bathroom the size of a normal complete hotel room  Massive bed and loads of room to spread all our stuff round  We will be back here some year for our anniversary hopefully  
N =>  Great Fun   summer rate   value for money I ve just returned to a   night    day stay at Dar Al Masyaf and I LOVED it  Was travelling through Dubai on Emirates and used the Madinat s current summer offer of     AED plus tax for a room  randomly sellected by the Group  in any one of the Madinat s   hotel s  Think I struck gold with landing a room in Dar Al Masyaf  Absolutely no hassles for a lone female traveller in this complex  and the butler Jed was a star in Villa     The room was stunning  the bathroom is HUGE  and the villa setting was exellent with pricacy and easy access to the water taxi s  quot arba s quot  and golf buggies which were called by your butler to pick you up if you wanted to go anywhere in the Madinat  Only issues was with check in  Arrived on a     am flight but was not given my room till  pm  Whilst I had access to the health club  and hotel facilities  after a night flight   all I really wanted was access to a bed   However  I guess the reality of this is that all hotels face this problem of turn around of guests and the Madinat Jumeriah do try their very best to make an early arrival as bereable as possible  
N =>   seventh time in   years Dar al Masyef is the best hotel in dubai bar non  i have just returned from my seventh trip with my eighth already booked for september This is the first time i have ever had cause to complain   as     japanese had desended on the resort and it had been booked over capacaty this caused people to be upgraded to the burj or ocean view villas  this was to be for   nights  after   nights i was told by my butler we had to move to a summerhouce villa which i had booked itold them i wanted to move straight after breakfast as not to spoil the rest of my day i was told that was ok I finaly ended up moving at      After complianing to the resort manager i was offered a complimentary meal with drinks and two bottles of wine  this came to      which more than made up for the hassle we had had The service we recieved in the second villa was fantastic I had told the manager that had this been my first trip to the resort it would have been my last but i think in this instance the staff are so keen to please that they will say anything to keep you happy  when they should really say  im sorry but you cant move villas until      then you know were you are and can work around it   The resort is out of this world and when a problem did occur it was sorted post haste  
N =>   By far the best Have just spent a wonderful weekend at Dar Al Masyaf  which is by far the best of the   hotels in the Madinat Jumeiarah Complex  We live just down the road in Abu Dhabi so are lucky in that we can get good weekend deals at hotels like The Burj  amp  The Emirates Palace but the service at Dar Al Masyaf was far better than at either of these more famous hotels which are much less friendly The Madinat Jumeairah complex is huge  amp  we were worried that we wouldn t be able to escape the crowds but even though all   hotels were full  we hardly saw a soul at Dar Al Masyaf  Our Arabian Summerhouse was beautiful  Fabulous bathroom  amp  the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in but what makes this property so special is its staff  Our private butler couldn t have been more helpful  amp  within    minutes  everyone from the pool attendant to the waiting staff knew our names  amp  were genuinely friendly  We shared our pool with just   other villas although everyone else spent all their time either on the beach or in the huge main pool so we had ours to ourselves  Every evening we were offered free drinks  amp  nibbles before dinner  amp  we had no trouble booking our choice of restaurant   something others have had trouble with  The attention to detail was excellent   from chocolate dipped strawberries at bedtime to the constantly replenished fruit bowl  Mina a Salam  amp  Al Qasr were much busier  amp  but even there it was never crowded  If you get to the beach or main pool before  am you will have it all to yourself  Do be careful of the jellyfish though as I had a couple of minor stings  Dar Al Masyaf is more expensive than the other two hotels but for a special stay it is definitely worth it  And although the Burj is a fabulous building after staying at Dar al Masyaf we wouldn t stay anywhere else in Dubai  
N =>   what a disappointment We stayed in Arabian Summerhouse  booked for seven nights   reception told us after   days we had to leave because booking was only for   nights   no alternative  Only after we returned to UK having had to buy extra flights  did they admit it was their fault  Still trying to get compensation  
N =>   dar al moscow went with wife and    year old daughter   rd visit to dubai chose summer house as alternative to hotel room  beautiful resort  photos do not do it justice  water taxis great touch  now souk is open givesgreat choice of eating but as others have said book early  good shopping and definately adds to whole package  now the down side the resort was full      russian who want to continue conducting businessby the pool on their mobile phones  i could have been a russian holiday or more likely dubai is now their no  choice  it seems they have money to burn   and resort prices are now reflecting this  but still a special resort 
N =>   Fantastic Stay  Higly Recommended Stayed in the Dar Al Masyaf for    nights  Stayed in A Gulf Ocean View Room which ment it overlooked the gulf which was amazing  Room Was extremely high standard  quite large  big bed  lounge area  terrace  and luzury bathroom with stand alone bath  big seperate shower  and dressing area Of course minibar overpriced but good slection  Butler Service was great    She he really looked after us during our stay and also free HaPPY HOUR in the SUmmerhouse recpetion Very Tidy resort  the boats to get around were good touch SPa was out of this world  great relaxant Souk was great   good atmosphere   had own starbucks Breakfast was a nightmare most mornings do not suggest the AL Qasr as there is a long wait  although food was delicious expensive stay  Staff moral could be improved  but netherless a truly magical hotel  Highy Recommended   
N =>   Fabulous recommend but          We have just returned from a great week in the Arabian summerhouses at the Dar al Masyaf  Overall the stay was great but they are overbooking in busy periods  We booked an arabian suite   only the ocean suites are more expensive  We arrived on the late Emirates flight and were greeted with a sheepish reception and told that we were being  quot up graded quot  to a suite in the Mina Salam  At     am I wasn t going to argue but I was well aware that this wasn t an upgrade even though it was still a fabulous room  After a determined conversation with the reception staff we finally got to see what we had booked and were moved after   nights of our stay  It didn t spoil the trip but make sure you reconfirm everything before travel Apart from that the resort was as perfect as ever   staff service perfect Make sure you reserve at least a couple of restaurants before arrival as they do get booked up The best summerhouses in my opinion are numbered       We ll be back  
N =>   Fantastic We stayed in an Ocean front summerhouse  The whole experience was absolutely top drawer  from service to food to weather to cleanliness I am a regular    Hotel person and this resort is up there with the best of them  Pointless writing more  I will merely run out of superlatives Will I go again    at the drop of a hat  
N =>  Again it blew us away    We again visited this phenomenal resort after our first visit last year  This time we stayed in Villa   which was superb  again   Everything about this resort is    star and we will definitely return next year  The weather in t was far more bearable than in y so I am looking forward to our return trip  I cannot wait  Possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in WORLDWIDE  
N =>  Amazing hotel Booked at the last minute and got a great rate for a private room in a villa The check in process was not the smoothest as they did not seem to have a twin room and wanted us  two female friends  to take a double room  After a complimentary drink and about an hours wait  we got shown to our room in Villa    WOW The room was fantastic  The beds were huge with plenty of pillows  the view overlooking the waterway was amazing and the bathroom was so large it just wasnt true The idea of a private butler seemed good  but to be honest  they were a bit hit and miss  One was excellent and two were awful  Instead of making our stay smoother  they created chaos and confusion We had trouble getting a booking for our restaurant of choice as it was  a  weekend   b  rugby   s and  c  National Day  If you know what restaurant you want  it pays to book in advance  I think that some of the more popular restaurants such as Pai Thai should hold some tables for hotel guests Anyway  first night we went to Pisces  fish restaurant  and had the set menu which was amazing although the service was a little slow  The food was delicious and well thought out and the accompanying wines really worked well Second night we got a table in Jam Base which is a jazz bar and again  the food was amazing  The service was superb and the live band started out well but became a bit  quot cruise ship quot  so we left and went to Bar Kooba for cosmopolitans We really enjoyed the buffet breakfasts which we ate in the Al Qasar hotel  The selection was brilliant and catered for every taste Unfortunately it rained during our stay which meant that the abras  boat transport  didnt run and the queue for the golf buggies was sometimes really long and late at night was pretty non existent  So much so  that one group of guests hijacked their own buggy and drove off The villa we stayed in was lovely and well thought out  We had a room on the waterway and shared a pool between   villas in total  The evening sundowners were lovely and it was nice to mix with other guests Checking out of the hotel proved difficult  Having been told we could have a late checkout  this was then denied so we suddenly had an hour to pack up and leave  Having asked for our bill to be ready first thing in the morning  reminding them when we left for breakfast and when we returned  we still had to wait nearly   hours for them to sort it out and when we did finally get it it was wrong  It took   people to finally get our bill ready which  for an automated system  seemed excessive Overall though  this is a fantastic hotel which I cannot recommend highly enough  It worked as a girls weekend away  would be perfect for a group of people and be amazing for a romantic break or honeymoon  The food was top class  but book ahead  
N =>   Incredibly adent Never have I felt so looked after  The service is amazing at this hotel  Upon arrival we were personally greeted and guided to our room  where our friendly butler could not do enough to help  The rooms are well furnished and extremely spacious with a luxurious bathroom the size of a bedroom in many hotels  The beds are incredibly comfortable and the sheets soft  A golf buggy or boat takes you to the delicious breakfast with a view of the Burj Al Arab dominating the skyline  Complimentary fruit kebabs by the pools were appreciated  Afternoon tea at Al Qasr lobby a must  Spa was a great experience  As an integrated resort you might think that it will be a contrived experience but this place pulls it off by going all out so is the perfect place to stay in Dubai  The only downside was that they could not do a late checkout as we wanted to stay as long as possible  
N =>   World Class service I have stayed in first class hotels in many different countries but this hotel surpasses anyhing I have experienced  It really sets a new standard and has probably spoiled me for anywhere else  We were picked up at our gate in the airport  escorted through the airport by a hotel representative and then transferred by chauffered Bentley to the Hotel  On arrival the staff came out and greeted us by name  whisked our luggage away then provided us with a comfortable seat  cold towels and cold drinks  whilst they checked us in  We arrived   hours before our designated check in but our room was available straight away  We stayed in a gulf room which was right on the beach with butler service  The butler service is non intrusive but anything you ask is responded to immediately and they will even print details of things you wnat to do or places you want to visit from the Internet  We took advantage of the cocktails on on the first night  but on subsequent nights we were not there  however our butler laid out our gin and tonics for our consumption later  The turndown service includes niceties such as laying out your slippers at the side of the bed and providing a glass and a bottle of water for each person at the bedside as well as the usual chocolates etc  We tended to breakfast at the restaurant beside the pool  however note that bacon products are not provided in the public restaurant although I noticed that they were available on room service  Service by the main Al Qasr pool is first class  bucket of ice with your bottled water  ice cold towels  fruit kebabs  face sprays  sunglasses cleaned  you really do feel spoiled  There are    restaurants in the resort and cover everything from fast food to top quality food  The Al Qasr has a lovely relaxed atmosphere in the evening with candles in the corridor and incense burners  if you need to find anything there is always a member of staff handy  who will escort you where you need to go  All in all this hotel really does bend over backwards to make you fell as if you are somewhere special  
N =>  Wow what a place for some serious spoiling  Returned yesterday from   nights in this resort staying in an Arabian Delux summerhouse  a surprise weekend from my partner because I was    on Friday Everything about this place is truly exceptional from the ice cold towells and cool facial mists of the beach butlers to the man who comes and services your room each evening  turning down the bed  leaving small chocolates and even in my case rearranging my hair clips that I had scattered around the bathroom in my hurry to get ready that evening    attention to detail in everything is at the core here and makes for a truly magical experience   Our butler was very helpfull  booking water taxis or restaurants and when they found out it was my Birthday  delivered a cake and flowers to my room  Every evening between   and   there is a complimentary drink to be had  served in your courtyard but this is not widely promoted which is a shame as it was a lovely way to start our evening  Pisces was the best place we ate in  and  in the top end of restaurants on offer  gave the best value  We spent a day at the Wadi water park  hotel guests get in for free  lots to do for all ages and plenty of sun loungers to rest between the rides All in all we had a fantastic time and would love to return  due to the amount to do here you really need longer time than we had  Also with so much on site we never managed to leave the complex   My only grumble for want of a better word  was the lack of basic information we recieved when we arrived  Had to ask alot of questions of our butler about where to go for breakfast etc and other basic info  Got to hotel at      am and could not access our room till       We used the time to wander round the souk but it could have been better used if we had been told we could still access our luggage  which had been promptly whisked away  and used all the facilities  We only knew about the pre dinner drinks etc from reading previous reviews on this site  A word of warning   If you want to go to the Burj for dinner or use the cocktail bar you need to book as soon as you arrive  otherwise you face disappoinment as I did when you find its fully booked on your last night   Oh well  just means we ll have to return  lol 
No comparison   the BEST hotel in Dubai  My husband and I stayed here in y       but have recently stayed in Abu Dhabi and went back for a peep  This truly is an outstanding hotel and deserves a review  Our hotel room  house   was gigantic  We had three beautiful balconies dining area study  sitting room  dressing area  a hotel room size bathroom plus a guest bathroom  and the largest highest bed in the world  The rooms are serviced twice daily with all the normal extras you would expect  slippers at the side of your bed  chocolates  happy dream messages etc etc etc  All the rooms houses are reached by  arbras   These are great for a look around the whole complex as there are two other hotels and a lovely arabic style mall    Madinhat Souk    On our second visit we went to  Mall of the Emirates    this is a shoppers paradise and shoe lovers dream  It also has an amazing ski dome  Welll worth a visit      There is no shortage of places to eat  I think there are about    dining options throughout the complex  There is a great cocktail bar in the Al Qasr   highly reccomeded but highly toxic with a the pipe fumes too     Dar Al Masyaf is definatly not disney  We had an evening at the Burj Al Arab  now that is Disney at its tackiest  overly opulent   The food at the  disco ceiling  sky view restuarant is amazing  They messed up our order and sang happy birthday to me   although it was not my birthday   then took the cake off me re lit the candles and took it straight to the next table  The manager found out and they gave us hermes perfume and aftershave  a personal tour and a yummy chocolate cake to apologise  I thought it was quite funny   The pool and beach areas were very quiet  The service on the beach was outstanding   drinks never got warm  fruit kebabs delivered fresh every couple of hours as well as the  Evian  man in charge of spraying hot bodies  bliss  
N =>  Wonderful Spent   nights in an Arabian Summer House  This was the best place we have ever stayed  The attention to detail  the magnificent service  the wonderful food  everything made it a truely memorable holiday The happy hour in the villa is not well attended   maybe not promoted enough   but we were there for a few nights and even drank champagne The room was well serviced  spacious  quality tolietries  great bed linen  changed every day  towels twice a day  just everything you could possibly need We will definitely be returning  
N => Absolutely phenomenal

Noisy clean rude and safe  Initially we were annoyed with the receptionists lack of communication skills   they took our passports to scan and left us standing in confusion whilst we waited for   something  However  once we got up to our room we realised that this is a nice  clean little hotel which is in a good location  A lot has been made of the noise and yes  there are nightclubs in the hotel  but we switched the airconditioner on and slept fine  be ask for a room higher up the building One tip   turn on the hot water in the bathroom as soon as you get there  It s not on automatically I d say this is a good hotel for the money  especially if you re sightseeing and not spending much time in your room  It s a cheap  clean bed in a safe hotel  
Nice rooms noisy nightclubs    I don t know why so many small hotels in this part of the world insist on running noisy nightclubs with thumping music that can be heard throughout the building  The Deira Town Hotel has not just one  but three nightclubs on the ground floor  Ask for a  th floor room on the quieter end of the building The rooms are large and clean  in my opinion   star standard with big beds and good showers  There is also bellboy service which I wouldn t have expected from a budget hotel  The location is within walking distance of the river and souqs  amid Dubai s Indian community  Females get a lot of  harmless  unwanted attention and stares around here   it s worth dressing modestly  
Nice New Hotel I stayed in this hotel for   nights   th ch to   th ch Initially when I booked the hotel via asiatravel com at      per night for a double room with Breakfast  there were no reviews as the Hotel is just   Months old  I tried everything to read about the hotel but no joy LOCATION  The Hotel is very well located in Deira  Omar Bin Al Khattab Road  Opposite DEWA Customer Services office   Department of Electricity and Water Authority   absolutely a great location  close to everywhere you want to go to    mins Airport   mins Gold Souk    min World trade centre  Cost       to gold souk and       to AirportHotel offered complimentary pickup and drop off at the airport   That was very good  RESTURANT  Loads of local resturants close by  at least       places to select from  The hotel itself has two resturants  one is functional  the breakfast was just okay  basic  I have had better breakfast in other hotels in Dubai  Please do not get me wrong  the breakfast was not bad  just basic  Room service was okay  nice sandwiches served round the clock for very cheap priceHOTEL DECOR AND ROOM  As the hotel is still very new  the decor was very clean and of good standard  Rooms were of average size  slightly bigger than small  absolutely no problem with the room  I requested for a top floor room and was given room      The hotel has   night clubs on the ground floor so it was be good to ask for a top floor room to avoid the music noise at night till  am   Dubai is full of fun  hardly will you get a hotel without a night club STAFF  The staff were very helpful and friendly  always willing to assist  door boy called Deprinder was always helpful  Reception staff also very helpfulThe only problems I had with the hotel were    No Gym    No Internet Service in both lobby and rooms    No swimming PoolI was rather surprised that a hotel in Dubai will exist without the above  even   star hotels in more remote areas have swimming pools and internet  For me  that downgraded the level of the hotel  I actually advised the management to consider including a gym  s pool and wireless internet to their rooms  I am sure this will increase their sales  Also there were no individual safe s in the rooms but they had a common room in the lobby with individual safes for guest to use and you were given the key to keep  A charge of     if you misplaced the key In all  a good hotel  I hope they will keep the place clean and friendly and obviously include a gym  pool and internet Will I stay again  Yes because of the clean environment and the location and then the free pickup and drop off  Checkin is  pm and checkout   Noon  I was allowed to check out at     pm In all  a   star hotel that could have been a   star with some simple basic extras See my pictures Below  
N =>   Very Good Value for Money Affordable  clean  no thrill small hotel  Very good choice if you want a decent hotel and do not have a small fortune to spend on it  Delmon has excellent location  walking distance to Creek   short taxi ride to center  souks  malls  attractions  Clean rooms  although will need redecoration soon  Restaurant not great  but ok  Free net and helpful reception staff  Free shuttle to beach makes it good alternative to beach hotels at a quarter of their prices  A small pool and gym on the roof  If you come here to explore not to spoil yourself and can live without the ulimate luxury and service that top end Dubai hotels offer  at a price   Delmon is an excellent choice 
Not worth it We checked in to Delmon Hotel in late  and stayed for almost two weeks  booked through booking com   The hotel is located in the very center of Dubai Deira  in walking distance to the clock tower  However  one should bear in mind that it may be rather unwise to walk around at daytime when it is about     degrees hot and extremely humid  The hotel has a pool  a roof top bar  they serve cold Heineken  and a night club on the ground floor Staff was very friendly and supportive  This is about the biggest plus of the hotel  apart from its central location  see above  The Room was unclean and stinky  and even substantial airing didn t help as some previous guest must have smoked heavily in this non smoker room  Daily cleaning didn t really improve the degree of cleanliness The toilet stunk despite daily cleaning Most annoyingly  the bumping beat of the nightclub music made its way night after night up to the fifth floor where we were staying  which made sleeping in times somewhat difficult The pool was filled with filthy water  They had the results of an  impeccable  bacteriological analysis on display   dates back from ch The breakfast buffet was nothing spectacular  but ok  Again  staff was very helpful and nice The roof top bar frequently closed at random times  sometimes as early as    p m  So  the cold Heineken wasn t a reliable pleasure  
N =>  Will not go there again I stayed in this hotel for   nights  Room is clean  ordinary restaurant  expensive nightclubs  staffs not very polite  And I was gonna take a lady to my room  first they charged me for    DHS and then I waited from     a m to     a m until they permitted me to go to my room and then they called me several times at     a m and asked me to send the girl out  I reckon I won t go there anymore  
N =>  Delmon Hotel   You could do a lot worse  I was searching for a hotel that was reasonable value and not too far from town  yet a good base fo business   I found a few that fitted budget and just went for the one that seemed to tick most peoples boxes and had least negative complaints   now dont get me wrong  this one had a few bad reviews but I ll give itmy best shot to be objective First off  i was chuffed to be met off my flight by a hotel driver   i wasnt sure if they did free shuttles and when i got emirates to ring the hotel to ask for me  by the way  Emirates is the only way to get here   do a fab job  they patched me to the driver who said he was waiting for me with a sign   that will teach me to look  Most hotels i have stayed at in the past have all charged for the shuttle service or ive had to get a taxi On arrival  i was aware i was   hours early for check in  however  when i asked if i could drop my bags and go to the pool  they told me my room would be ready in    min and to help myself to breakfast while i waited   again  FOC   They ask for your passport when i checked in and I wasnt sure if i would get it back  however  they returned it as soon as i asked without any problem   i think they just take a copy for their records The hotel is next to a new build of apartments  to try and find one thats not next to contruction work in Dubai is fairly difficult   but in faireness  I didnt hear any noise   i was on the  rd floor  room     on te other side The rooms are clean  comfy and fairly up to date decor wise  IT was as quiet as could be expected for a downtown hotel Pool was nice   if you like watching contrution and airplanes then this is the place to relax  Serious though  its alright   fab service from the staff and pool bar team  Addd bonus is they have wifi on the roof and in reception   in the rooms they have a wired connection  but this is not obvious  Food wise   its ok  Breakfast is more than adequate  I stuck to omlettes cooked by the chef  and the one and only dinner i had in the resaturant was ok   there are better places to eat on the main street   mins walk away if you want more choice Staff   not one person was unhelpful  They remember your face and room number with spooky ease and are always at your service Summary  Good service  Good Value  Good Hotel  There are better hotels but expect to pay for them   
N => 	st full week off in   years   worth the wait   As the title says  this was my husbands  st full week off work in   years  amp  it was well worth saving up for financially so as not to whack it on the credit card  No regrets whatsoever  We had Suite    Huge  definitely of    quality  Ipod  zoned lighting  electric blinds on floor to ceiling windows overlooking polo fields  aircon  Nespresso machine  fully stocked fridge  Bathroom  Double sinks  sound speakers  large bath  phone  amp  bidet  shower so big I took my coffee in there  amp  it didn t get splashed  Immacculately clean  amp  I look for problems Food  Rare steaks were mealt in the mouth  We were given a few little tasters that weren t on the menu as a gesture as well such as cauliflower  amp  foie gras soup Epicure  Tried to order a tiger prawn  amp  rocket salad   it came with spinach instead  Tried to order white toast  they didn t have that either  No issue  just that they are the basics that s all  Plenty of choice on the menu  amp  it is all handmade  good quality  A lot of the locals arrange their own celebrations at Desert Palm as the reputation  service  quality  amp  food is good Complimentary jetlag massage given at Lime  amp  thoroughly enjoyed the Movies  amp  Munchies Night sitting in the pool in the inflatable armchairs after sunset munching popcorn while watching on a big screen The Italian Job  What a fab idea that was   Reception staff gave us the address so the taxi driver knew how to return us safely  I didn t realise until the last day that there were magazines for the taking in Epicure  As we had an horrendously early check out at stupid o clock  we were offered breakfast in bed which was a lovely thought on their part We d pre booked afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar in the Burj Al Arab  Great experience but never did get my coffee that I ordered  
N =>   Small hotel beautifully styled a little far from Dubai centre We spent   nights here on our way to Mauritius to break up the journey and see what Dubai is all about  The hotel is fairly small  which we liked  beautifully styled  very modern and boutique but whilst only   mins from the airport is some way out from Dubai itself  This meant having to catch taxis to get into Dubai   most of the taxi drivers did not know where this hotel was located so we had a couple of  lost  journeys to handle  We arrived in the holy month of Ramadan and whilst there were certain restrictions  this did not detract from the facilities and services offered by the hotel  Service was excellent and staff very friendly  The room was spacious  wall to ceiling windows overlooking polo fields  bathroom delightful with all the mod cons you would expect  ipod  wifi  coffee machine  TV   all complimentary  Spa facilities are fantastic with friendly and adept staff and good value too  Overall this was a lovely place to stay and enjoy the facilities   there are no views though  only polo fields although it does have a lovely pool  We ate at restaurant  Rare  which was a bit disappointing and quite expensive   food was very salty  bottle of cheapest wine equated to about     otherwise a very enjoyable short break here  
N =>  Terribly disappointing checked out half way through our stay  We chose this hotel as we didn t want to stay in central Dubai  As we were shown our room  we were very impressed with the decor and the high standard of finish  The room had an entire glazed wall which overlooked the bar below  A nice touch  but we wanted a quiet stay and questioned whether the noise would be a problem  We were assured it wouldn t  but it was  By       that evening  we could hear the bar noise as clearly as if we were in the bar itself  turns out the window was broken  We were moved to another room  which was no better  Eventually we requested to be moved to a villa  which although lovely  felt like it was in the middle of a Desperate Housewives set  People live in the same development as hotel residents  so it felt nothing like being on holiday with people doing the school run and walking the dogs in the early morning  Besides the issues we experienced with the accommodation  we also encountered countless service issues  Perhaps we were unlucky  but it was bad enough to make us check out early  something we have never done before  Everything we ordered from room service was wrong  orders would be incomplete  or just wrong  or take so long    hour   that it was either cold or we had raided the mini bar  I requested crumpets for breakfast  on the menu   and was told for   mornings in a row they didn t have any  and blamed their suppliers  not once offering to get some for the next morning despite shops being nearby  I then requested hard boiled eggs  which took three attempts to get right  the first   times they weren t even cooked  let alone hard boiled  We noticed at least three othet tables having the same issue  One evening we went to Rare for dinner  We were one of three tables there  and the first thing the waiter greeted us with was  quot we don t have this  this or this and we have one left of this quot   We were amazed  this is an expensive restaraunt and there was barely anyone there  We walked out  At no point did any manager step in and try to resolve any issue  and the staff seemed completely bewildered when we complained  rather than try to resolve issues they shrugged their shoulders and smirked  After   days of this  we checked out  and went straight back to central Dubai  which although busy and crowded  at least knows how to treat paying customers  I was very happy to leave Desert Palm  it could be such a wonderful place but attention to detail and standards of service lets it down  For all the negatives we experienced  I must say that the Spa was stunning and the staff there were friendly and attentive  
N =>   Out off this world  Great property  beautiful surrounds but most importantly staff and food are fantastic and out off this world  Just our of Dubai but you have a great view back over Dubai  If you love polo and horses there are plenty to see  Staff are just so helpful  Would recommend any body to stay there  
N =>  Beautiful villas  We stayed at this hotel last weekend  e       for a night away  After reading the other review on this site  the only other review we could find anywhere for this hotel   we were slightly worried but shouldn t have been as overall we had an excellent night On arrival at reception we were greeted by very enthusiastic and helpful staff  if  as the previous reviewer had said  a little inexperienced  who gave us drinks and cold towels while we checked in  We were pleasently suprised to be upgraded from a pool villa to a pool residence at no extra cost  As our villa wasn t ready  we took a tour of the hotel with the lovely Godfrey and then had a drink in the beautiful bar in the main hotel Our room was ready within    minutes  From the outside  the villas do not look that impressive  however when we opened the door we were very pleased  The lights  air con and IPOD were all already set up for us  The villa was huge  pool residences have two bedrooms  three bathrooms  an office  a huge living room dining room and kitchen  In addition  we had a large outside area with table and benches  a large pool  sun bathing area and wicker  quot egg quot  chair  in which we spent most of the afternoon   Everything was beautifully new and clean  We received a plate of complimentary fruit and deserts  The hotel website really doesn t show enough pictures of how gorgeous out villa was  Our pool was really big  especially as it was just the two of us  and it was completely private with huge walls surrounding our villa  so even though you are only a few meters from all the hotel amenities  it feels really lovely and secluded The only slight downsides we found were    The menu in the restaurant we choose to eat  Rare  was extremely limited only   main courses and   choices of starter desert  This wasn t a problem for us  but may be for a fussy eater  The food we did have was beautiful    The hotel is located rather close to the sewage treatment works in Dubai   this wasn t an issue at all  expect for when we returned to the villa in the evening there was a slight smell in the air Overall  we loved this place  great  helpful staff and a beautiful villa  If you want to shut yourself away from the world for a day or two  this is the place to do it  
Not as Expected     i stayed at the desert palm resort this week and i had the pool residence villa    First of all let me explain the Desert palm Resort concept  it s a polo gated community on the highway towards al aweer and next to the chinese market  dragon mall     the resort villas are not newly built as everyone would expect when browsing their website    they are a refurbished villas which used to be a yearly rental villas next to the polo fields    the resort villas are situated next to villas of people who lives there with their families in this neighberhood    so you could call this a rental villas in a neighberhood instead of a resort villas    as soon as you enter the lobby to check in for your villa you will feel that the staff are not experienced at all but they are trying though   but the positive thing is that they are friendly and want to help you    when we went to the residence villa we knew from the paint job and the garden that this is a refurbished villa which was built few years ago for long term lease    Also i want to add that the T V  channels are very limited  maybe       in the villas and the in room dining menu is also limited     also the pool is not temperature controlled    
N =>   Lacks Soul Large comfortable rooms but designed for recreational rather than business use   lighting could be better  Colleague had internet problems in room and had to use business centre   not convenient  Dining options very limited so ate elsewhere  Friendly desk bell staff and good value for money but somehow cannot see myself staying there again  There was no buzz at all  
N =>   Centrally located Good locations and very central   Good value for money   Even though they advertise  this is not a   star   good rooms and food   
N =>  superb food grand lobby superb hotel  excellent rooms  nice indian food too 
N =>  Stay Away Very poor hotel which contradicts the four stars awarded  Rooms dark and gloomy  Musty smell throughout  windows did not close properly and there was a general drabness despite the relative newness of the building  Do not believe the website   pictures can tell a thousand lies as well as stories  Room on arrival had no bathrobe  towels  slippers or stationery  To top it all there were no items in minibar but it did have the previous occupants half eaten sandwich and leftover KFC coleslaw  Even with constant reminders I never did get all of the missing items  Bathroom floor remained dirty throughout the stay  
N =>  Hotel FAIL  Completely Avoid  First time poster and this is a review I felt compelled to write while still staying at the hotel itself  It has been one of the worst hotel experiences of my life  First of all  I am generally pretty laid back about hotels  but enough has happened this week for me to sign up for a Trip Adviser account just to relay my experience  This is NOT  what so ever  by far  even in a fairy tale  a Five Star Hotel  If I didn t see it myself I doubt anyone would believe this experience as it seems like something you would only see in a comedy at the movies Background  We are traveling as a large group with an    room block for business travel  I arrived a night early for a   night stay Room  When I first arrived  I walked by the   Star rating outside the hotel  I thought I would be impressed  The room they gave me was a box with no windows and with the internet connection not working  Thinking the cable was unplugged from the wall  I went behind the desk and found an open box of condoms  They quickly upgraded me to the only side of the hotel that actually has nice rooms  the front  and apologized  Room was nice  but the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired  But at least the internet worked at blazing fast speeds of   KB per second Restaurants  Half of the restaurants are closed  They website lists six  but all are closed except Docklands  the Italian place  the Indian place  and the bar  They even list signs to these restaurants and their operating times in the lobby on an electronic display  Clearly this hotel has zero attention to detail if you cannot even delete the restaurants from your electronic screen placed at the front of the hotel Internet and Business Center  They charge you     a day to use the internet at speeds slower than a   KB modem  Completely and utter rip off  We tried to  rent  a projector but they said we could only buy one instead  In the hotel book it says  quot A V equipment can be rented at our Business Center  Please contact our Business center to arrange your requirements  quot  We called back and mentioned this and again they said they could only have us purchase a projector  Finally  we had to print pages for a business report  I asked where the nearest Kinkos FedEx or printing location was   blank stares from the staff  They finally printed it themselves and charged approximately    USD per page  Concierge  Complete Clown Show  First  When we first arrived they pointed us to a bar a    minute walk from the hotel that was full of prostitutes as  quot the place to go quot  that is close to the hotel  Second  I tried to get several tour bookings through them and even tried to set up a golf tee time  Each time the  quot concierge quot  handed the phone to me and I had to talk myself to make the bookings  I finally gave up  Others in our group had similar incompetent experiences with the concierge  It was joked that they might have trouble booking us a glass of water through their own room service Security  First story  When locked out of my room  I had to get a new key  I went up to front desk and asked for a new key  They gave me one without asking for an ID  Second story  This is might be a five star hotel if you are a sex tourist perhaps  It seems the ladies just walk up to your room and come on in  To make matters even more comical  one of my business partners had two prostitutes ask for the key to their room at   AM because they had left something in the safe the night before  They walked in on the sleeping woman and woke her up to have them check the safe  She took a photo just to prove she was not making up the story  She later found out that the ladies handed out a room key without ID  To test the theory  two days later  she went up to the front desk and directly asked for the key to hey room from a new manager  The manager started to hand over the key without checking for ID  until she asked if they were forgetting something  Final story  While having beers late one night  the  night club  they had downstairs clearly had some very colorful individuals walk through the hotel  Location  Horrible  Construction is directly on the right side of the hotel  Most of the rooms have zero view if they have a window at all  The location  as we found out  is in a more seedy area of the city  To get to Atlantis or downtown the cab drivers knew where to go better than the cars and drivers that the hotel used  They looked nice and the cars were better than cabs  but each time I was in one of the cars  I questioned if the driver really knew where we were going  In one instance  he dropped us off   mile away from the location we asked him to drop us off at  Straw that broke the camel s back   Having come back from a business tour  I headed across the street to Burger King with a friend and we came back to the hotel  Sitting on one of the tables in the lobby not associated with any restaurant we were relaxing eating our food  The head manager walked up and asked us if we were guests and asked us to take our food to our rooms as outside food was not allowed in the lobby  I wouldn t have said anything  but I felt that this hotel had too many problems for this to be a true concern and they did not have any signs posted  He proceeded to argue with me even though I had asked that they make an exception  Completely flabbergasted we both headed to our rooms after having been scolded like we were in high school by the manager  Is this truly how they treat their paying guests Final verdict  Between complete lack of customer service  location  value  security  and general feeling the entire week  I would give this hotel one star  Why one star  They at least had working toilets  Do not come to this hotel  
N =>  BAD experince it was the worst hotel i ever stayed in    the room had no window  it was simply like jail    plugs   electrical and internet  were not working  when we complained none bothered dont ever think of using it 
N =>   A bit ropey Tired  a bit grubby Unambitious  dhow  themed   gaudy interior adds to the overall unpleasantness Public areas feel a bit civil service  
N =>  Good with Some Bad Points I stayed there for business for   nights  I booked for a deluxe room and they kindly upgraded my room to the admiral room The rooms are clean but the decor of the room and bathroom was not that good  The view was not good too  Most of the staff were friendly  The swimming pool was under maintenance  roof top  The location is in a relatively quiet place  The major problem was finding taxis especially from   to   PM  which was really annoying  Bur Dubai is in the middle between Deirah and other parts of Dubai Compared to the high rate        Dh   I think one can find much better hotel but the business event I attended took place in this hotel and the transportation in Dubai is clearly a problem  I had to stay there So if you have a car and got a better rate than I had  then it ll be OK to stay in this hotel  Otherwise  better spend money on other much better hotels  
Nice Hotel We stayed in Dhow Palace for a week  very good hotel considering the price  The only problem is getting a Taxi  There are hotel taxis available all the time but they are very expensive  If you had any problem go directly to the duty manager we found this very helpful  
N =>  Would Not Stay There Again Stayed here on our stopover from Maldives back to San Francisco  The only positive remark that I have about this hotel is the food  Tons of choices and the in room dining was delicious  If anyone has ever traveled to Dubai you know that the times are really erratic for flights leaving and arriving etc  We had a stopover on the way to the Maldives and on the way back  Our first stopover the experience was wonderful because the hotel that we stayed at allowed us to checkin early at around   am and without us even requesting an upgrade or telling us they were unable to accommodate us at this time  because they didn t have the room category that I paid for available  upgraded us so we could rest  Most hotels in Dubai will accommodate you but this hotel on the other hand is a real stickler for checkin and checkout times  The lady at the desk was so outrageously rude to other members of the staff in front of us  that I was actually appalled  Then she wasn t pleasant to us either  After grumbling about the fact that we were here early all she could is give us a room is a lower category  We were like fine it doesn t matter because we just needed to rest for a     hours and then leave  The room she gave us had no windows so it felt like a jail  Very small to the point that our bathroom door wouldn t open all the way because it was hitting the toilet  A design issue  I think so  Room Itself  I just felt gross being inside the room  There was funny smell to it  the lights were dim in a room that already felt claustrophobic due to no windows  I have no idea who gives hotels their official rating because hands down this is not a five star hotel  I repeat absolutely not a five star hotel  Can t stress that point enough and it wasn t cheap either  If I was to compare it to a hotel in the United States it is probably more on the likes of a La Quinta maybe    to     stars at best  The rating for this hotel should be revised  The only reason we stayed there is the first place was because we wanted to be closer to the airport  Big Mistake and will not be staying there ever again and please take the reviews of this hotel seriously  It is truly not a five star hotel in any category except for food  
Nice but       Our family has just back from Dubai for my husband business trip  We got viceroy suite  Roomwise it s so HUGE   with capital letters   and it s very beautiful  It s    sqm  with separate dining and living room    outside toilet and a jetted tub in inside bathroom  However  I feel that it s a little bit untouched  When we checked the room for the first time  some lamps were not working  the TV set in the living room wasn t working  the toilet spray was leaking  But they fixed it right away the next morning  Breakfast were fine  No complaint about it  Al Madina supermarket is just   minutes away to the left  We can get pretty much everything  including my infant milk  The first and major but is taxi  Definitely an issue  This hotel is situated in the quiet road  you will need some time to get a taxi  Just make sure you look around and check who s standing there before you  On our  rd day  one hotel guy with black suit cut our line twice  It seems that he wanted anyone who asked him for a taxi got a taxi first  And thinking those who only asked a bellboy can wait  The second but was the room service  Only tried once  It took them more than   hour to prepare a sandwich at    pm  The strangest thing  they have menu option from hotel restaurants  not separated menu  but it s clearly inside the room service menu  But when we tried to order that  they say no  We just can choose for room service a la carte  The million dollar question is why they have the restaurants menu on their room service menu then   The next but is the hotel swimming pool  It s on the rooftop and very small  So it s a little bit packed on the evening  I think that s all I can say about this hotel  It s still a nice hotel to stay  Even with   kids  But next time  maybe a beach hotel will be a better idea  
Nice hotel pleasant stay Recently returned from a business trip to Dubai where I stayed at the Dhow Palace  Can t really say if it s a good or bad location from a holiday trip point of view  but for my needs it was perfect  The room was spacious  clean and comfortable  a c on the first night a bit cold but the extra blanket sorted that out  and of course you can adjust the temperature yourself      Nice buffet breakfast included in the room rate  At check in I was informed about the facilities such as spa  pool and gym  and when I got to the room I was informed that the internet would be charged separately  Did not have time to use these though  so I can t say what they were like I did not have one bad experience with any of the staff  they were all polite and helpful As mentioned also in previous reviews  there is a small supermarket very close to the hotel  For more shopping  the Burjuman Shopping Mall is about       minutes walk away from the hotel  and you don t even have to cross the big roads  From the main entrance  go left  pass the minimarket   and continue straight until you come to the big crossing  Take a left and walk towards Spinney s  a big supermarket   After Spinney s there is a small shopping centre  Centrepoint   continue on for a bit and you will arrive at Burjuman  That s where I spent my free evenings    For the women travelling alone I can say it was perfectly safe to walk there  even walking back at       pm on a Thursday evening I didn t feel at all uncomfortable  There are also several restaurants  fast food places in this area All in all a pleasant experience and I could definitely stay there again  
N =>   Very bad customer service Haven t been there yet but just got off the phone with them  Am from UK and have made my reservation through Expedia  Just called the hotel to confirm if they did    hour check in out   and they don t  For a   star  i expected this to be the norm  Was told i d have to pay for the extra night if i was to arrive at  AM  The thing that really put me off was that the telephone operator first put me to someone else to deal with my request  and that person simply transferred me to Bookings  who were closed for the day  Surprise  surprise  there wasn t even a message at the end of the line saying that they weren t available to take the call  The phone just kept ringing  Some   star hotel this  Now will have to check the expedia cancellation policy on hotel bookings  
N =>   beware of internet connection During our one week stay we suffered lack of hot water on three occasions and despite contacting the hotel manager to date we have not heard from him  In addition  we connected our laptop to the hotel broadband connection and have since been a victim of fraudulent use of our Skype account even though we did not connect to the internet because of the hotel s excessive user rate  Although the rooms are fine  if small  everything is cheap  Staff  other than front desk  unable to speak basic English and altogether the service is pretty bad for a hotel of this rating  We have stayed in many hotels in Dubai and this ranks as the worst  
N =>  very nice hotel nice location very helpful staff except one behind the reception wearing suit was not polite at all that was when we were checking out at about midday arabic chap  apart from him everybody was nice especially the manager when we were checking in  food was good  lovely atmosphere  easy access to all shops i would go back again  i hope that miserable man in suit would have left  
N =>  y is Very Humid On arrival the Dhow Palace from the outside looked very unusual  by night as you come back the Dhow Palace looks impressive all lit up   but once inside we soon forgot that  it was brilliant we got there early and the staff went out of there way to have us in our room as soon as possible  which was very nice very clean but very cold due to air con Building has just begun next door so from Id say october on could be a little noisy in some rooms but as we have seen you would be lucky to find any place in Dubai without a building site close by After reading some other reviews for the Dhow Palace I can see what they mean about communication but like we say well we can only speak english  and with a little bit of effort you get through it All of the resturants within the hotel are     star  Try the Indian it was the best we have had the flavours are out of this world and all the staff are tripping over to please you Cost of all the restaurants are very cheap  excluding the Steak restaurant  even when you include the costly alcohol into the bill     Dirham  for two  Word of advise dont over order as when you order drinks a bread and dip platter turns up curtosy of the house  For us not looking for a beach holiday this was without a doubt the best location dont book trips just buy a Berlitz guide book and away you go  take the taxis as very very cheap all air conditioned  just walk   m up the road from the hotel and within    seconds you will be in a taxi  
N =>    Stars Not Even Close     Check in   Hotel staff should know how to treat guests after   hrs of traveling  It started off well  but when we wanted to change our breakfast they refused to change the days around and wanted to charge us for it  our reason was because we had an early flight the next morning  we have had no problems with other hotels  Plus there was a huge communication breakdown  where their english was of a very poor standard  Our Room   Room       First impressions looked nice  large bedroom but tiny bathroom  The bathroom had a shower over tub with a shower curtain  single sink  poor ventilation and a Caravan Park quality hair dryer  that did even dry my hair   The walls were paper thin we could hear kids running in the halls and people walking by Other facilities   Internet   We tried to purchase a   hour block but they would not provide the service  yet we could purchase a   hour block  which was quite expensive  All we wanted to do was to check in for our next flight and check our emails  Luckily we were able to find the business centre  which was much better then trying to access the wireless system in our room Our other tip would be to walk a few hundred metres down the road to the little supermarket to buy goodies  the mini bar was terribly over priced Will we be back    Very unlikely  I hate giving poor reviews  but unless they change there procedures and had more capable staff we won t be staying there again  
N =>  who gives the star ratings on arrival hotel manager tried to get me to pay extra for a bed and breakfast for my son aged     I produced the paperwork proving i had paid in full for the both of us but this he tried to dismiss no bottled water tea coffee ect in room in my opinion certinatly not a   star hotel id give this place a miss  
N => 	Star    For me  a   star property has excellent customer service of which the Dhow Palace sorely lacks  From check in to getting a cab to dealing with the tour desk or concierge to check out the dismal customer service was evident  Though I enjoyed my room  the rest of the hotel experience was quite disappointing  Also  DO NOT USE THE TOUR DESK  We arranged a half day tour and I was specific what I wanted to see  We were paired with a private driver who steered us to shopping areas instead  He was not very knowledgeable about the city or its history  Upon check out  I discovered a charge for something I did not authorize and had to argue with the desk clerk to remove  He tried to say the charge had already posted and I could not do anything  then when I pushed to have it removed  I realized he had lied about the charge already posting to my credit card  
N => 	star food and service but   star facilities Used mainly by airline staff   they even have their own lounge Food was   star  The staff were a bit shy at first  but warmed to us after a few days  and seemed to become more confident  Nothing was a problem to them  just ask We chose the hotel as we wanted to be central and near shopping   and after previous years experiences   away from the cement dust noise gridlocked horrors of the permabuilds around the Jumeirah beach hotels Dhow Palace badly let down by the  quot pool quot    located on the roof   after negotiating the pipes and cables  It is miniscule  has limited sunning areas and loungers  and suffers from chilly winds due to it s location and lack of shelter  If someone jumps in   you ll pop out  Gym and other leisure facilities adequate enough Otherwise  a promising hotel   if you can t handle the beach  or a swim sunbathe   
N =>  Very comfortable ne hotel New hotel  geographically slightly apart fom other shops etc but very comfortable  It s shaped like a ship and all the staff wear sailing rig  Food and beverage were excellent and the staff were very helpful  Wake up calls for      actually came at      which was disappointing  Booking a taxi was also easy  but it never actually arived on time The steak restaurant had some bad reviews in Time Out Dubai  but our meal and steak was absolutely first class We had a hotel invitation to collect a free Kandahar Watch as part of the Dubai  government s  tourism effort  We were escorted in a particularly tacky Indian car to a tacky shop where were were asked to view Swiss  Kandahar watches that were       up  They looked like they had been made in Mumbai and stamped Swiss  Don t go  We didn t buy even though the temption to have a photo watch seemed irresistable The room rates and service were very good and I would go again  
N =>   If you are human just avoid this Hotel   Dolphin Hotel Apartments Dubai  I stayed at this Hotel in        and treated like a Dog  They forced all their guest to submit their passport  In fact  I made a police complain for that too  In case  if you are visiting this Hotel  Please  Please don t submit your passport  And if you will submit your passport  please be prepared for surprise Another thing  they might give a drop off transfer in a Van without Air conditioned  So be prepared to get lot of surprise in this Hotel I will strongly recommend that if you are human and paying just close to       just avoid this Hotel  There are   s of Hotel next to this Hotel which provides lot better service at the same price  
Nice Hotel Cum Appartment I had been in Dubai for   days and stayed at this place  It is a nice hotel cum appartment and very very good for asians specially Indians  The rooms are really big  spacious  neat and clean with an equally clean bath  The location of the hotel is also good ie in Meena Bazar  There are plenty of Indian restaurents near by and is also near to Deira  The only turn off is that sometimes the area gets a bit crowded  The breakfast is nice  amp  Suitable for Indians  
N =>  vegetarian delights Arrived there on an overnight flight  had emailed the hotel prior to arrival so that i can have an early check in but the man in reception was very unhelpful with this and could do with a lesson in customer service  However a room was sorted out after making a bit of a fuss which i think you have to do in general to get anything done as people are very laid back The room was ok  two single beds  kitchen area and seperate bathroom Cleaniing was ok and we recieved a complimentary bottle of water everyday whilst we were there The breakfast is buffet style but only vegetarian both indian and continental  this was a slight downside as we were not told that this is a vegetarian only hotel  but you can have food delivered to your apartment Overall it was ok and central near the meena bazaar and walking distance to get the abra   water taxi  to deira which was quite cheap  can get a bit noisy at night but still ok  consider going again as the rest of the staff were very friendly  
N =>  Nice and Cosy Dream palace hotel was really nice and cosy place to stay  i did my booking online through www booking com and got a single room for great price exclusive of taxes but if u compare dubai  that tax money was peanut  Its located in good area with great food joints around  i did not try the hotel restaurants  I reached dubai on   st oct  took metro from terminal   to AL RIGGA station  n just walked to the hotel  around    mins  u can ask people for direction to AL MURAQBAT road  Host at reception was nice and helpful  dont expect it to be a   seven hotel   Room was small but cosy and very clean  No free internet    dhs for an hour   but managed somehow  rest all mery mery  n good  Over all i can give it     of    
N =>   Good value Paid less than USD    for   nights without breakfast  Cleaning service for the room good     I would press the button  quot pls  make up room quot  on the phone panels  amp  it was done when we got back  Towel exchange available as needed  Complimentary bottled water x   big  in fridge  TV channels limited  amp  some channel had unclear reception  I had to pay for internet service  Shower stall too small  Front desk upon check in was good but the staff on check out needed to brush on her people skills  This is a clean  amp  comfortable enough hotel to stay in so I would come back again at the same price or lower  
N => NOT HAPPY NOT SAFE I Stayed in this Hotel for three nights in the month of JUNE     The last night of our stay  some one tried to open the door of our room  where my sister and I were sleeping at      or      o clock in the morning When I complained to the mannager   he said it could have been the ROOM SERVICE             This Hotel is NOT SAFE  I do not know who tried to intrude in to the room where two girls were sleeping in the middle of the night THIS HOTEL IS NOT SAFE  
N =>   Good choice We arrived at the hotel at      in the morning due to a delay in our flight  staff was friendly  check in was quick and we could go to bed just a few minutes after our arrival  Room was OK although a little noisy  Breakfast was good  The swimming pool was too hot for a bath  For its price and location  not far from the airport  I recomend this hotel if you need to do a long stoppover in Dubai  
Newly renowated good value for money The hotel is newly renowated  rooms are nice and quite big  The view isn t spectacular but at all it is a very good offer in resonable price  We didn t have a breakfast and possibly this hotel doesn t offer them  We booked with otel com what is good site for booking in Dubai as you pay full price and don t have to be worried about additionaly paid     local tax  The photos on otel are old as well so the hotel looks much beter tha there  The hotel is in Deira district not that far from center but you have to either take a taxi for about    USD or bus to Deira center  It is not that close to the airport as well       min   Comparing to other hotels in Dubai  and references on tripadvisor  there is no any disco closeby  It is nice and quiet  
N =>   Dream Palace OK   place to sleep Nice location not far from the city center  Reasonable rates  Family hotel  meaning no alcohol   discos and no visitors to guest rooms  If a friend from outside visits  you have to meet in the lobby  Quiet  fairly clean  Was interested only in a decent place to sleep at night  as I was attending a   day conference in a nearby  more expensive hotel  So  I didn t check out any of the amenities  Would be quite comfortable taking family with me next time for an overnight stay  
N =>   Probably the crappiest hotel in Dubai My husband and I stayed one night at Dream Palace because we needed to stay in Dubai for a night after our vacation in Fujairah in order to catch our plane out the next day  The place was horrible  It smelled seriously weird and the rooms were frightful  I figured it wouldn t be a big deal since we were only staying for a night  but you can pay a tiny bit more and probably get something  anything  nicer than this place  The front desk was always overwhelmed  so we had to sit on our suitcases in the cramped lobby while we waited for them to check the guests in  They really need to get a better handle on the check in process  On the bright side  it s a short taxi ride to City Center Mall  If you re absolutely desperate and on a tight budget  the you ll probably be ok  But if you re sensitive to bad smells and easily infuriated by bad service  go someplace else  
N =>  Cheap and Ok My Partner and I just stayed at the Dream palace  we went just for shopping and was planning to stay out all day  The hotel rates are cheap and located centrally but still need to get a taxi     minute ride  to places  It was a clean hotel but the furniture was very dated and the hotel room was very dark and dull  Our air con wasnt brilliant  Its great for a cheap holiday if your not planning to stay in the hotel all day during the day  The breakfast was not appealing  I was expecting a fry up but it was all arabic food  The staff dont really understand much english but are helpfull  
N =>  Okay if every other hotel is full The Dream Palace hotel should not be anybody s first choice of hotels  It is an older hotel which they have tried to keep decent but it s a losing battle  The hot water was warm and the cold water was warm  There was way too much furniture in our room and the furniture was out of proportion  Most of it looked like it was made for giants  The curtains were hanging crooked on the curtain rod and it was difficult to open them  The only towels were bath towels  no hand towels or face cloths  The beds are very firm hard  Not too comfortable  Alot of Russian businessmen stay there  I would say the Dream Palace compares with a motel   in the states  
N =>  Not Burj Al arab but it was pleasant Dubai was our last stop before heading home to Perth  Australia  Having searched for a decent  value  hotel on the internet  we decided to gave this hotel a go  We were gonna settle for Ibis  thank God we didnt  its shoe box size room kinda put me off Anyway  when you arrived in Dubai and if you re holding Australian pasport  you wouldnt need to get a visa  so went straight to the immigration queue line  in Paris we were told by the ticketing lady to get visa when we arrived in dubai  Doh    We checked with the airport guy in Dubai and he said we DIDNT NEED A VISA  Ok  lets moved on to other important thing  BEER  or any other alcohol beverages for that matter   Grabbed yourself a trolley  went straight to duty free shop  and filled your trolley with as much cartons of beer alcohol beverages as possible  Why    because outside the airport  Dubai s a dry country  If in any case alcohol were available  it s very very expensive  So word of advise  stocked up before leaving the airport     so you ll always had cold beer in your room after a full day tour on a hot day   sweet    So  back to Dubai Concorde  we ve got picked up and taken to the hotel  By the time we got to the hotel it was past midnight and only the night shift were on duty  They asked us to leave the passport overnight  which I reluctantly gave  which made me all panicky thinking of them losing our passports  but luckily they did take good care of the passport and were handed back to us in the morning after the receptionist sorted out all the admin  My husband said  they have stacks of all the guests passports there    the thought of this made me shiver And I was glad to see that I wasn t the only one who s not comfortable leaving my own passport in their hand  because the next day while we were chatting with the front office this middle eastern guest was literally begging the receptionist to keep his passport safely or else Now  the hotel itself  I must say it s no Burj Al Arab but it s was a pleasant hotel to stay  The staff were friendly  the hotel clean and comfortable  with big room and comfy bed and AC    Breakfast buffet were good and plentiful  The location of the hotel was close to the Gold Souk  They organized a car to take us to the Burj Al Arab for dinner which was nice  you needed to call the Burj for dinner reservation and they ll send you a confirmation fax  Then you must bring that fax and showed it to the security at the gate to enter Burj Al Arab   I know   It sounded like mission impossible or     but it so worth it Attached to the hotel  on the ground floor there s a restaurant where you could try some shisha We were in Dubai mid e and the sky was unfortunaly foggy 
N =>   Very helfull staff and comfortable hotel We had an early flight and thus came to the hotel at  am They were full but made us comfortable in the lobby offered tea coffee and were able to give us a room in    minutes I had read mixed reviews and so was aprihensive but must say they are a good hotel traveller friendly The breakfast is amazing and roomservice was very fast Wifi in the rooms helped us stay in touch with our office Theyy have a shuttle to malls and becomes very cost effective value for money higly recommended 
N =>   Have never stayed in a worse hotel I have just spoken on line to my husband who is on a business trip to Abu Dhabi  Not being able to get a reservation in any of the hotels in Abu Dhabi the company booked him into the Grand in Dubai  for   night only   he has now gone to the Hilton in Al Ain which is     times better   He didn t get any sleep last night as there was constant noise from the room next door  the corridor and the night clubs  He reckons that the hotel was being used   I leave it to your imagination as to what for There was no internet in the room The room was not very clean Overall impression   NEVER AGAIN 
Not To Be Recommended Stayed one night at this hotel prior to early flight following day from Dubai airport  The only thing going for this hotel is its close proximity to the airport   about    mins by taxi  Otherwise give this place a miss  It is in the heart of an industrial area surrounded by plumbers merchants  builders yards and also the area has some dubious characters hanging around  The pool is huge  but consists of   sun loungers  and lots of rubbish and general tacky  The hotel staff are not particularly helpful  You are at least    mins by taxi to any of Dubai s attractions  The rates charged are very expensive for what is basically a   star Travelodge 
Not grand but great value Our travelling pal booked this hotel and after later reading the negative reviews on TA I had some worries  I was pleasantly suprised We arrived after a long and late night flight at the grand around  am tired and disoriantated  the hotel is a    minute cab journey from the airport  The manager at the desk was polite  asked us to wait in the lobby  offered us showers etc in the pool area       and we could see he was trying his best to get us some rooms in what was a fully booked hotel  By     am we had our rooms  Our room was large with comfortable beds    singles in our room  our friends had a double  flat screen Tv  mini bar and clean bathroom  hot water and good shower  The bathroom defintly had a strange wiff of curry but this wasnt really an issue The breakfast was ok with choice of tea  coffee  juices plus eggs  beans and sausages  omlette chef  cereals and yogurts An Indian style spicy breakfast was also available  A negative point about this hotel was the expensive internet  at   pounds for a half hour this is a rip off The location is very near the airport so its quite far from the souks and malls however unlike most things in Dubai  the cabs are still a bargain  Our first trip to Dubai was   years ago and we stayed at the excellent Hilton Dubai Creek  the prices of hotels in Dubai since then have  I feel doubled  Since you cant stay at the beach these days for less than     quid the grand is excellent value for money  Of course if your expecting   star luxury then you will be disapointed but if you want a good base for a   or   night stopover you cant go far wrong here If you want the beach i would recommend the public beach adjacent to the Jumeriah complex  Its quiet and you get a great view of the Burj Al arab  The Beach parks are dirty and full of staring men ogling anything in a bikini I would also recommend the new Dubai mall  it has one of the largets fish tanks in the world  free  and even if you dont like shopping its bawesome  we also got a cab to the unfinished Burj tower  Another great experiance  
N =>  If you speak Hindi      I HAVE to stay at this hotel  My company pays for it  But if you have any other option    flee Unless you speak Hindi  then you re going to love it  The DGH has seven bars  All have an Indian theme Need I say more  
N =>  Good Hotel friendly staff This was a stopover on our way to Mauritius  On our first day we arrived a little early at   am in the morning  Out room was booked from    PM  But the hotel staff cooperated and gave us a room in couple of hours  They even allowed us to have complementary breakfast in the meantime The food was good  especially in their Punjabi theme restaurant  
N =>   From Melbourne Australia I was pretty hesitant with this hotel given the negative reviews here on trip advisor  but staying here proved to be a very pleasant experience We Stayed at the Dubai Grand Hotel for three days in tember       I found that the Hotel was more than adequate for our stay and was inline with a   star hotel  All our tours was taken care of by the tour desk operator Alpna  She was great  The rooms are clean  They do take your passports as you check in which isnt a bad thing as I thought because they arranged our Airport transfers on time and they made sure that the passports were safe and not forgotten  They provided a Buffet breakfast for us that was very reasonable  Some Indian fare was also included in the buffet  The fruit drinks were great  I have only one complaint  the make shift coffee shop in the hotel lobby does not allow you to sit in their seats unless you haven t bought anything from them  The cashier during the day didnt have a problem with our family sitting thier  but the rudeness of the night guy was pretty appalling  Thier is hardly any seats in the hotel lobby area just to have a sit  So stay away from the coffee shop plus they are expensive also to have a drink from    Dhrs a can  Across the road is a good supermarket  A place to get your cans of drink for around   dhrs  
N => Great stay Really helpful  friendly staff  Helped every time we entered and departed the hotel  Yummy breakfast  Large  comfortable room  Not the newest building in Dubai but well kept  Helped us organise our trips  New Zealand  
N =>  Definetly NOT four star quality I had a    hour layover in Dubai  Wanting to get some rest in a comfortable setting  I decided to venture out of the airport and check into a hotel I went through a Dubai International Airport hotel reservation counter which was located just past the passport control  The person behind the counter recommended the Dubai Grand Hotel and said it had a four star rating  He also told me the taxi was only going to cost me      He forgot to tell me that it would be that much only if I got an HONEST taxi  but that is a different story After I agreed to the rate         I started looking behind the counter at the advertized hotels  I couldnt find the Dubai Grand Hotel listed anywhere  There were hotels listed by star rating off to the right  No Grand Hotel  That should have been my second clue  As the  quot reservationist quot  was helping me  I mentioned this fact and asked him if the Dubai Grand Hotel was truly a four star hotel  He assured that it was  I also asked if they had internet capability in the rooms  He also said yes  I paid for the room and went on to get ripped off by the taxi  The taxi took the LONG way to the hotel and made a     trip into a     trip  When I got to the hotel  I told the front desk that I thought I was being ovrecharged by the taxi that had brought me  They sent a bell boy outside to talk to him  He at least stopped the taxi driver from taking me for     using his exchange rate  but did nothing about the inflated meter reading  The bell boy suggested that I get Dirhams  local currency  from the front desk I only had large denominations  but I asked the front desk to only give me     worth of Dirhams and the rest US  They promptly exchanged the entire     amount at their inflated exchange rate and completely ignored my request After being checked in  they insisted on keeping my passport until I checked out  This is something that I never have been asked for in all of the international hotels that I have been to  upwards of      If anything  a photocopy of my passport has been taken  but never the original  I dont advise anyone to agree to that  I did because I was tired and didnt want to argue anymore after the taxi ordeal Once I was outside my room  I noticed that about three doors down  one of the hotel staff was entering a room with a key and saying out loud   quot Housekeeping quot  as he entered  I checked into my room at   AM local time  What the heck is a hotel staffer doing going into a guests room at  AM   He had no towels  no  roll away bed  no luggage  nothing      I ll let you decide Once inside the room  I put the  quot Do Not Disturb quot  sign out  deadbolted the door and immediately noted that I was NOT in a four or even three star hotel  The carpet was stained and worn  The wallpaper was stained and peeling  The  quot brass quot  light fixtures were worn and rusted  The room had that peculiar Indian from India smell to it   You know the one I m talking about   All and all  The room was of a cheap motel quality  The  quot mini bar quot  consisted of a mini refrigerator with a   cans of soda    bottles of water and a crumpled juice box  The bathroom was appointed with VERY cheap ammenities and decor  The bathroom floor was dirty  The personal lotion bottle that was included in the comfort section of ammenities had been previously opened and used  about     of it was gone  Having been in worse hotels  I decided to make the best of it  The water in the shower would not get hotter than warm and the in room thermostat did not regulate a thing  I froze my butt off and I had just come in from having spent two weeks in the Korean winter  The tv remote didnt work and the internet access was dial up  I had to unplug the phone to use the internet at a per hour rate This hotel was definitely NOT four star  It was more or a two star and that is being generous  I do not recommend the stay at any price above        a night I felt compelled to write this review after seeing that somebody gave this place a four star rating  Must have been a hotel staffer that went in one of the guest rooms at  AM and used the internet on their dime  
N =>  Never again  I stayed there for four nights  For professional reasons I spend some     nights per year in hotels all over the world  I have been to other hotels in Dubai before  I would not call Dubai a benchmark for outstanding service  neither for good prices  But even in comparison with that this place is horrible  Dirty old carpet in the room  stains on chairs and sofa  The balcony dirty and dusty  You would not want to touch anything  let alone sit down  The way you are treated by receptionists gives the impression that they assume you constantly want to betray them  Not a single smile  not a single friendly word  no Hello  no Goodbye  not even after checking out  You seem to be disturbing them all the time  Do them a favour and leave them alone  
N =>  Avoid even if it s free  My partner and I stayed   nights at the Dubai Grand Hotel and we have regularly travelled all around Europe prior to this trip and stayed in many hotels but without doubt this is the worst hotel we have stayed in  Service was poor  Staff tried to rip us off when we asked about booking the Dune Safari  We were told that we could not to sit in the lobby area as we were not buying anything The double room that we were given was located on the  nd floor directly above a disco  with loud blazing music that went on until  pm  resulting in five restless nights  The water from the taps was not hot  just barley warm thus we could not take an adequate bath or shower I spoke to one of your staff members regarding the noise and water the first day  where I was assured that the situation will be resolved  and that I will be given another room on the top floor  From that first day till the night before the last day yet again I went back to the reception with the same problems but the matters were not resolved Also we visited one of the clubs in the hotel called  Shama  despite the fact that we were not aware of what kind of club this was until after ordering our drinks we were charged a ridiculous amount of    dirham for two glasses of coke and we only stayed there for    minutes and despite writing a letter of complaint with the above points to the management  they basically offered no form of apology or compensation You have been warned  
N =>   Extremely noisy air conditioner in an expensive hotel We booked a   hour stopover in this hotel as a means of avoiding hanging around in the airport terminal overnight  We knew that the hotel was expensive but thought we d give it a try  The bathroom was clean  with all the required toiletries  including a hairdryer  The bed was comfy but the room overall  was fairly average  The air conditioner was the worst part of it all  It could not be switched off  unless you removed the card from the slot at the door  which meant that none of the lights worked  It was extremely noisy and switched on and off  even though I d set it to what I thought was a constant fan speed  The AC drove me crazy  
N =>   Overpriced hotel incompetent staff complaints ignored N B  This review is in two parts  my original review followed by an update at the end detailing the hotel s response to my complaints ORIGINAL REVIEW    ch       We only checked out of this hotel this morning but  even though I have only just got off a long flight  I am so angry that I wanted to write this review straight away  Please read the excellent reviews below to get an understanding of the unusual hotel set up  There are different sections of this hotel in terminal   and terminal    Our experiences in the terminal   part of the hotel  where we stayed for a brief overnight transit stop en route from the UK to Australia  were very favourable  We first stayed overnight in       in the Terminal   part of the hotel  We were very impressed with this part of the hotel   although it was not cheap at     Dirhams  approx       for   hours  We were met off the plane and escorted through the airport to the hotel  which saved us considerable time and inconvenience  We were pleased with our room and enjoyed an adequate meal from room service  The reception staff at check out were friendly and efficient and we embarked on our onward flight feeling refreshed When we returned to Dubai on   ch      at approx   p m   following an exhausting    hour flight from Brisbane  we decided to try the Terminal   part of the hotel as it was nearer our arrival and departure gates  Again  we were met off the plane and escorted very quickly and efficiently through the airport  for which we were extremely grateful  We were very pleased with our room and immediately went to sleep as we had an appointment at the opposite side of Dubai at      p m  When we awoke at   p m  we discovered that the water supply to the room had failed  No water was coming from the taps  bidet or shower and we were afraid to use the lavatory in case we would be unable to flush it  We had some difficulty working out how to contact reception as there did not seem to be a list of extension numbers anywhere in the room  When we did finally manage to speak to reception  we were told that the problem would be passed on to the relevant person  There was no indication of what we should do  We did not know whether we should pack up our belongings in preparation for being moved  whether we should begin changing to go out or whether we should wait for further instructions  We considered whether we should ask to be moved to a room in Terminal    We did not  and  in light of the treatment we received later  this was a mistake  After some time  still without water  we had heard nothing further and telephoned reception again  The receptionist was not very clear  but we gathered that the whole hotel was without water  Had we been told this in the first place  we would have known just to go ahead and prepare  albeit somewhat poorly  for our appointment  rather than waiting for someone to arrive at the door  No adequate apology was given   either for the lack of basic amenities or lack of communication  So  we had no option but to go out without having had a shower  use of a lavatory or even having been able to wash our hands  We were extremely upset  felt grubby and were late for our appointment  When we returned from our appointment  a silent message had been left on our hotel room answering machine  We suspect this had been reception trying to contact us  but it is difficult to know  By this time  the water was running again but it would have been fair to let us know Check out the following morning was a fiasco  We were kept waiting for quite some time before anyone came to help us  which in itself is very poor at an airport hotel where the guests have flights to catch  The gentleman who eventually came to serve us seemed to have very limited English and a poor attitude  He claimed to know nothing of the water supply problem the previous evening  We thought it fair that there should be some compensation for our inconvenience but  after nodding in apparent agreement  he prepared the bill for the full amount and insisted on entry of the credit card PIN number  We refused to do this until we were told what amount we were about to pay and what reduction we were being given  He delayed for some time  gave us no further information  then again insisted the PIN number be entered  Again  we refused  Indeed  by this stage we had still not seen an itemised bill and  in our experience  it is customary for guests to be shown an itemised bill for approval before settlement of their bill  we can confirm we received one in Terminal     He was considerably annoyed  huffed and puffed and said he would have to ask someone else The next gentleman was little better  He was also ignorant of the failed water supply and actually asked us whether we had reported it at the time   Why wasn t it already known that we had in fact reported it twice   Indeed  the pair of them almost refused to accept the problem had happened at all  He had to telephone a third person  The reduction we were given was utterly inappropriate for the level of inconvenience we had suffered      dirhams off a      dirham bill   i e  approx     off a      bill    really an insulting reduction bearing in mind that WE HAD HAD NO WATER  The amount of and reasoning behind the reduction was not explained to us  nor were we asked if we thought the amount was adequate  which it was not   The original receptionist didn t seem to have a clue how to operate the computer system and had to be told what to do by his colleague at every stage  By this point  considerable time had passed  our flight was being called and  although we had been calm  infinitely reasonable and patient throughout  we were becoming quite distressed  We felt that this was not the time for staff training  We paid the reduced bill   the amount of which was still very far from clear   and were about to go when suddenly we were told that we needed to pay for a glass of milk we had ordered from room service the night before  It was explained that this was a last minute item which had therefore not been able to be included in the bill  This was inaccurate as we had received the milk nine hours previously  We explained that we now had to run to make it onto our onward flight before the gate closed  Finally  still without seeing an itemised bill  we were asked to sign a slip  which we did  There is very little opportunity to entirely clarify the situation in such circumstances  We were very distressed and not at all in a suitable state of mind to begin an eight hour flight  Indeed  we are still upset now We understand that unexpected problems do occur sometimes  The failure of the water supply would have been forgivable had the situation been dealt with in a professional manner by the reception staff i e  proper communication at the time of the incident and a sincere apology and a reasonable discount at check out  Surely the whole purpose of an airport hotel is to allow guests on short stopovers to have a shower  brush their teeth  use a lavatory and to begin their onward flights in plenty of time  feeling refreshed and relaxed  Professionalism demands that guests know what they are paying for and that staff be aware of problems which occurred during their stay   especially when reception staff had been notified twice that there had been a problem and on both occasions had promised to do something about it  Regrettably  the hotel utterly failed on all these counts  This incident raises many questions How can an international airport hotel be without something as basic as water How can reception be unaware of such a major problem as there being no water in the hotel Is it appropriate not to keep guests informed regarding what has happened and what is going to be done about it How can it be that a hotel does not keep a log of a major problem such as a water failure  especially after being notified twice Surely some standardised form of recompense in the event of such a failure exists Surely this compensation would automatically be arranged for checking out Why was an itemised bill not prepared in advance Is it fair to try to convince guests to pay without sight of an itemised bill Is it fair that guests leave without an itemised bill Is it fair that guests with ample time to reach their flight be left having to run through an airport Is it fair that guests at a stopover hotel should depart feeling frustrated and distressed How can we possibly recommend such a hotel to anyone else How can we possibly consider ever staying at such a hotel again We feel that  given our considerable inconvenience  both during the initial water failure and extremely confrontational checking out  we were not well served by the hotel  Indeed  we feel that we are entitled to considerable further financial compensation as we were not provided with the most basic amenities for which we were paying and also to compensate for the considerable distress and inconvenience we were caused by the hotel staff  Please continue reading to see the hotel s response to our complaints UPDATE           Further to my original review above  I e mailed the Dubai International Hotel on   ch       having returned home on   ch  saying that I wished to make a complaint and asking how to go about doing so  The Rooms Division Manager replied and provided me with the e mail address of the Operations Manager at the hotel  On    ch I sent them both a detailed e mail regarding the problems we had experienced during our stay and explaining how much distress we had suffered as a result  On    ch  having received no response  I sent a letter of complaint to the hotel  On   il I still had not had any response from the hotel and sent another e mail outlining events up to that point  pointing out that my previous e mails and letter had been ignored  informing them of the poor review of the hotel I had written which was currently on Trip Advisor in case they were interested and explaining that if I did not hear back from them shortly I would be writing an update to said review to that effect  The next day a vague message was left on my answering machine promising to call me the following day  but   surprise  surprise   a month later and I have never heard from the hotel again  In summary  THIS HOTEL DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS  You should be aware that if you experience any problems during your stay at Dubai International Hotel   you re on your own  
N =>  Excellent rooms mediocre staff Stayed for a    hour transit  Upon booking you specify the hours but the rate does not differ for   to    hours  and anyhow I did not prepay  Still when my plane was    mins early the check in initially told that I d have to WAIT those    mins before being allowed into the room  Luckily   mins later a supervisor walked in and cleared the matter About the room  old terminal  nothing but praise  Very spacious  perfect beds  large bathroom etc  etc  Room service for a quick lunch was again slow but good  tasteful  food  Had no time to try gym pool but they too looked okay  
N =>   Overpriced Facilities We have stayed in this hotel a number of times in the past while transitting through Dubai airport  This time we were travelling through the new terminal    The terminal does not live up to all the hype  The inbound flight parked at a terminal   gate  involving a long walk into terminal   to get though the security  The outbound was also from terminal    involving a long walk back We found the sign for the hotel  east wing  in teminal    There was also a sign to hotel  west wing   The east wing reception was not very efficient  with a trainee on duty  alone  After about    minutes queueing we completed the registration process and were given a room in the west wing  That involved a further      minute walk Having stayed in the  old  hotel in terminal   previously I had some expectations  These are definitely not met in the new hotel  Despite being advertised as a luxury hotel the room is really little more than a good budget hotel room  at luxury prices I know that the terminal and the hotel are new but the hotel is not yet ready for use  There was complementary water in the room  but the tea making facility was missing If you have an option  try to get your room in the terminal   hotel  the rooms are significantly better in quality  value  etc  
N =>   Overpriced Perhaps my expectations were too high but for a   star hotel in Dubai this hotel was underwhelming    star price for a   star hotel  
N =>  Great but expensive Great place to stay if you are tight on time and need to sleep  Easy access  good facilities  Only problem is the cost   you need a big wallet if you wish to stay here  
N =>  Rather over rated This hotel is in a good location by the beach and over the road from the Jumeirah mosque  The grounds are very nice with streams and lots of trees  although the accommodation blocks are not near the pools or restaurants  We had a junior suite for one night but were a bit disappointed that it was really just like a townhouse or apartment with small windows  access through a lobby area and didn t feel at all like a resort room  we were on the ground floor   We had no complaints with the room itself which was well appointed  spacious and clean and would have been lovely in the middle of a city  but not really what we expected by the beach  Our only experience of the other facilities was breakfast  which was the worst we experienced during our whole trip   service was slow and a bit sullen  the food was limited in choice with no Arabic ME dishes offered and what was presented was lacking in flavour  We felt the hotel was OK  mainly appealing to European groups  but expensive for what was on offer  
N =>   Not to bad  When I stayed here it was due to close proximity to my business meetings  I read over some of the reviews here and really don t agree with some of them  This is not the one of the high end hotels where you pay a ton of money per night and not a   star  The service is not great and the restaurants borderline terrible  If you ever been to Thailand stay away from the Thai restaurant  but for a reasonable price in Dubai  I had a special  I got what I paid for  Location was good for me too  I enjoyed the recreation facilities  beach  tennis courts  gym   Warning though  When you come outside looking for a taxi the guy in the stand will try to get you take one of the white luxury cars  Do not do it  they are rip off artists  Wait for a regular cab or hail one just on the main road  
N =>   Definitely needs a make over We stayed in the Dubai ine Beach Club in tember last year  We have stayed in many of the Dubai hotels and this place was definitely the worst  We live in Duabi now and frequent the bars and restaurants of this hotel  I am writing this review  not necessarily to rate the rooms but more so to rate the experience my friends and I have had in one of their clubs  Boudoir  We have been to this club many times  We have always liked it  Tuesday night is ladies night and the club offer free champagne to all ladies  We were at the club last night from about   pm  It was quiet but soon filled up  In fact  over filled   There were   of us in the party and were standing at the same spot at the bar for all our time in there  At about  am  a dubai national  moved into our spot at the bar  He told me to move  I said no  He proceded to order some drinks for him and his friends  All alcoholic I might add  We were then  quite promptly  escorted out  Now  why would a club like that serve alcohol to a UAE national  Why were we asked to leave  Another issue  which disturbs me more  was the fact that my wifes drink was tampered with  This isn t the first time this has happened to someone we know  Many of our friends have had similar experiences  ie not remembering anything from the night  if even after only one drink  Chronic illness throughout the night  black outs  etc  This is not simply after having alcohol  as we have never experienced this in other bars or clubs  Only here  Yes  of course there may be other explanations for this  I understand this story may be heard the world over ffrom other bars and clubs  However  I feel that this has gone on in this club for long enough  I  or my friends  will not be going to that club again  We will recommend to our friends not to go there either  It simply not good enough to deny that drinks are being spiked  Patrons are entitled to enjoy themselves without the worry of something happening their drink and spoiling their night  This club  for the reasons above should be avoided  I do intend taking this up with hotel management  I will post their response  if any  
NOT a   star hotel   Stayed on week at this hotel  but we tried to change hotel after   days  Rooms are basic  balconies are  m wide with no furniture  but better than basement rooms    Outdoor areas are worn down  beach is crowded  less that    cm between sun chairs  The beach is too small even for the number of hotel guests  and on top of that the hotel accepts paying guests  It is packed  The ubrellas are mostly not working  and if you are lucky enough to find one that does  it has been removed by the personell  given to other guests  if you leave to eat lunch in one of the hotel restaurants    When complaining to reception about this and a lot of other issues  tehy told me I could just leave the hotel   The only positive to say about the hotel is the restaurants  they are very nice   There is a reason why this hotel is cheaper than other   star hotels  If you want luxury  pay the extra and go to other hotels    
N =>   Dont Believe ALL you read    After reading reviews I wanted to cancel this holiday but after spending the  days there  I can say that some people most just like to complain The room was a good size and spotless  but make sure you insist on a balcony room and dont accept a lower ground one     The food was excellent especially the Tai restaurant  even the half board menu was superb  Staff was exceptional   our party was all treated like royalty  However the only dissapointment was that England did not win the Dubai rugby   s   all said and done excellent value for money would go back their again someday  
N =>  Nice location but average service We arrived in Dubai on    ober from Al Ain  We had great expectations of this hotel  The setting is undeniably fine and very well placed to tour the city  However  the check in staff seemed more keen to get you to upgrade your room than anything else Room was not bad at all despite refusing upgrades  Delightful garden setting made the place  Beach bar very slow and the food was left sitting on the counter for sometime before the waiter decided to bring it to us  We were not impressed by the food from the two resturaunts we tried in the evening which did seem a bit expensive for what they offered  Excessive air conditioning seemed the norm here   to the point of being quite uncomfortable to us who were acclimatised to the heat of the Emerates After seeing other places in Dubai  I would not return 
N =>  Just trying to book was a nightmare  After looking at working in South Africa for a few months I decided to detour Dubai on the way back to England  I found this hotel and thought it looked nice  After reading the reviews on here I was rather dubious but thought I d give it a go  I contacted the hotel direct and was quoted a great half board rate  In fact it was so great I double checked it with them twice   each time they confirmed it was correct  After   days of correspondence checking all was in order I went to book my flights and the hotel When I came to book the hotel however they had added on an additional dhs      per person per night   a large additional charge  When I queried this with them  I was informed that the half board rate they quoted did not include accomodation   I could not believe they classed half board as meals only  They said I should have known accomodation was extra  As far as I was concerned half board is your board and your meals  Obviously not at this hotel Needless to say if they can t even get this bit right  I am not spending my money to stay here   imagine what else would be wrong  
Not a good choice Really not   stars    at best  The reception staff was unfriendly and incompetent  The rooms were small and old  The beds were uncomfortable They have about   restaurants  Only the buffet type is open during the day  For a lousy buffet they charge      They beach could be ok if it weren t for the oil tankers and the harbor    m down the road There are so many nice hotels in Dubai  Don t waste your time and money in this one  
N =>  Dont Stay Here         I ve stayed in many five star hotels in Dubai and I have to say this is the worst  There is no way this hotel deserves the five star rating  For the price of a room here  you can stay in other hotels on Jumeirah beach that are much better quality  I reserved a standard room for my girlfriend and I and when I got there I was shocked to see how small the room was  It was more like a motel room  I booked a King size bed but the bed was smaller than a queen  It would have been so uncomfortable fitting two people on that bed  I complained to the front desk and they told me that standard rooms either had a queen bed  theres no way that bed was even queen size  or two joinable beds     but the suites had a King bed  I decided to upgrade to a ior suite which was better but still not five star quality that one would expect for the price  The carpet in the living room was dirty and full of cigarette burns  The couches looked old and even the towels in the bathroom didnt smell fresh  Even worse  when I got into bed I felt itchy all over  I thought I was being paranoid but my girlfriend felt the same thing  I dont even wanna think about what it was  I booked for   nights at this hotel but after two hours  I decided I had to check out as soon as possible  Unfortunately  the front desk wouldnt let me check out without paying a penalty and they told me to contact the travel agent I booked through  even though the travel agent had informed me beforehand that all cancellations were to be made with the hotel directly   Anyway  the travel agent contacted the hotel and they finally allowed me to check out without a penalty  but unfortunately I had to waste two nights there The only thing good I can say about this hotel is that they have pretty good restaurants and nightclubs which are very popular  El Paso has got good food and Sho Cho and Boudoir are very happening  But you dont need to stay in the hotel to visit these establishments To sum it up  dont stay here if you want a five star experience  Check out Grosvenor House  Royal Meridien  Hilton Jumeirah  They are all around the same price and much better than this badly managed  sorry excuse for a five star resort  
Not a   Star Resort Very uncomforable Beds but nice Gardens and Restaurants My husband is in the Navy and we hadn t seen each other in months  I met him in Dubai for a reunion and we stayed at the Dubai ine Beach Resort  The gardens were beautiful and the restaurants were good  However  the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the room smelled awful  The first night they gave us a double bed and the next day we requested a King bed  They switched us to a room with a King bed which was comprised of two twin beds pushed together  The rooms  mattresses and lobby were outdated  Also  both rooms had a chemical smell that made us sneeze which made the room a very uncomfortable place to be  The service was good except for one of the girls at the front desk  She was extremely rude  aloof and had a major attitude problem  I think this would be a good hotel to stay at if you want close proximity to the beach and restaurants and don t want to spend a lot of time in the room  Good place for singles or families  However  if you want a honeymoon experience stay somewhere else     Also  my husband and I hugged briefly in the pool and were promptly scolded by a hotel staff member that there is no hugging or kissing in the pool  In addition  the hotel is very close to a mosque and the call to prayer is rather loud very early in the morning  If you are a light sleeper you should take that into consideration prior to booking  
N =>   Great Place to Stay We stayed at this hotel for a week in e y     amp  it was amazing   The weather was great  which is always a great start to any holiday  On Arrival check in couldn t have been more helpful  amp  we were quickly taken off to our room in a  quot Golf Cart quot The rooms were spacious clean and tidy  amp  the Air Con was a must with the heat  The beach was amazing  I am usually not a beach person  but I think I went into the pool once  I will warn you though  as my partner found out probably not best to sun bath for   hours straight in this heat  she actually passed out one day  but the staff were again amazing  amp  helped me get her back to the well air conditioned room  Unfortunately for her the staff remembered her for the rest of our stay  There are a number of lovely restaurants on site  we tried the Italian  amp  Thai  which were great  but there were so many more to choose from  We were able to book day trips out from our hotel  which was handy  amp  also at reasonable prices  The Desert Trip is a must   All in all we loved Dubai and this hotel and would definitely stay at this resort again  
Not bad but def not   star We moved from the Hilton Creek to be on the beach and whilst the facility is not bad  I found the hotel dated and not in the usual upmarket spirit of Dubai  The rooms were clean and comfortable and most of the staff were friendly and helpful  The breakfast was terrible  It felt like a Russian Republic sitting on the Beach  I never heard anyone speaking English  The one good thing is that if you are up for a party  attached to the hotel are very popular bars where all the hitters go to unwind late in the evening  It doesnt affect the hotel or guests and there is no noise  Its worthwhile just standing outside watching the Ferrari s and Lambo s pulling in  
N =>   Brilliant holiday  My boyfriend and I have just this week returned from Dubai after a   night stay  I was a little worried at first as I had read other reviews of this hotel  We arrived at the hotel about     am and were given our keys immediately  the receptionist was very polite and helpful  The sun was shining and the resort was lovely  Not too big but big enough to be just right  We found the staff to be very helpful and polite at all times  The beach was small but never overcrowded and plenty of sunbeds  The restaurants were great with a wide choice  We had a standard room which was decorated to a high standard  Our holiday was lovely from start to finish and I would recommend this hotel any time    I shall go back  
N =>   Not   star treatment We stayed here between  th t to   th t       We had problems the moment we arrived  Since our flight landed at  am we arrived at the hotel by  am  This being our  th visit to Dubai never had any problems with early checkins at any other hotel  However  upon trying to checkin we were told we would have to wait until around  pm  pm before a room was available  Reason being was that the hotel was full  When I offered to pay  quot half day rate quot  the lady at the counter  who was very rude  told me she would have a room available with in   hour  So obviously they did have rooms available but were not prepared to let us checkin early for free  By time they had a room ready it was   am  and i was not prepared to pay     for a   hour early checkin  At this point i spoke to a manager  who only became available at   am  who apologised and let my wife and I check in  Having thought this was the only problem we would have  when we saw our  quot junior suite quot  I was not happy  it was on the ground floor  very dark because no light was allowed in through the hedge as our view  At this point we headed to the pool area  the pool itself and the area around it was nice  but again the service let the hotel down  It took   mins for me to get a coke that I ordered  not dubai standards  I could go on and let you know about further lack of service at this hotel but it would take me too long to write it down To sum up  pay the extra and stay somewhere else  PS  The beach was very small and not to the standards of other hotels in the area  
Not worth the money Hotel staff in the morning are curtious  However  the hotel staff in the evening is completely the opposite  It s like a curse comes on this hotel at the evening time  It s actually a nightmare to try getting into the hotel every night  Reason being is that there is only one access to the hotel without an exit  You might be surprised but YES this is the fact  The only exit out of this  what they call   stars  hotel is only through Jumaira beach stree  There are   restaurants and   different clubs on the hotel premises which makes accessibility to the hotel everynight like hell  If you go to the hotel to visit any of the restaurants or clubs you might enjoy it  but if you choose to live there  I believe it might be a big mistake  The second evening of my arrival  I went out and then got back to pick up something from the hotel and then come back to catch a movie  Guess what  it took us more than an hour to drive in and out of the hotel that night  which was a regular week night       Two movies have passed by the time I got out of the beach strip  which was the only way out  One other major problem in this hotel is if you would want to use the internet  they charge   derham per minute for the DSL connection which is really crazy compared to other   stars hotels in Dubai that offer it sometimes for free  The other major problem about the hotel is its rooms which they call villas  They are actually very small in size compared to other suites in other   stars hotels  The main room in each villa is relatively small compared to other   stars hotels that we stayed in previously  In addition  the rooms seem to be a little old and humid inside  TV remote didn t work One good thing about the bathrooms that there is a built in engine for making bubbles in the bath but who needs that when there are many other problems the hotel is facing I met two managers at the hotel and provided some feedback  both seemed to be very calm and negative at the same time  All management staff in this hotel seem to be clearly a cheap labor and not a   stars professional management staff To sum up  this hotel is not worth the money  You would be way better off investing your money in any of the other major   stars hotels in Dubai area so you can enjoy your stay  
N =>   Steer clear of room       Having lived in Dubai for three years and knowing this hotel only by eating at their Thai Bistro and the Alamo Mexican restaurant  hotel bit opened just before we left for UK  we wanted a place to stay which was close to the city but had a beach  also a hotel that wasn t involved in the huge amount of building work going on in Dubai at the moment at the other end of Jumeira Beach Road  and this hotel seemed an ideal   star choice  However  on check in we were given the most awful room  number        broken curtain rail  wall safe broken  aircon not functioning properly  twin room but we ordered double  and it seemed to us that they were trying to fob us off with their only room available  Unfortunately we were checking in at       We complained that night but decided to sleep in      and complain again in the morning  The front desk manager didn t want to know and said we could upgrade to a junior suite at a cost of     per night  having booked for a    night stay we were not prepared to pay this extortionate rate and said so  We threatened to leave and asked them to prepare our refund in cash  Half and hour later they upgraded us to a better room without cost  After this debacle we spent a lovely peaceful holiday on the beach  the area this hotel is in is great as you can cross the road to visit some local restaurants which are very good value especially the Automatic Lebanese restaurant in the Beach Centre  that s not to say the food outlets in this hotel are bad  far from it  The open air Italian is wonderful dining overlooking the sea and the Japanese lounge restaurant is excellent albeit the service is a bit slow  But all in all we had a great time and would return for a second stay  
N =>  not even close to a   star hotel I Went to stay at this hotel in june      with my husband and   other friends all of us had been to dubai before and all of us agreed that this hotel is not worthy of its   star rating The main pool was closed  the food at the pool bar was shocking  no fresh bread at breakfast and the rooms had a horrible smell of mould in them  we phoned our travel agent and asked to be moved to another hotel  we spent   nights in the dubai beach marine and spa and it was   long  we were moved to The meridien minah sayhahi  not sure if i spelt that correctly  It was brill i recommend it The dubai beach and marine hotel is good if you want to go to a club the boudoir has good music and the waitress was giving out free champagne it tasted like crap and it was a nice touch If you are going to dubai i highly recommend the ritz carlton to stay at you are treated like rotyalty  
N => lovely place to stay fantastic atmosphere  
N => Disappointing rooms  
N =>  dissapointing not what we expected  
N =>  Not the   Star Delux it claims to be   
N =>   Mejor no volver  
N =>   Ottimo per relax  
N => Good value in a good location My husband and I stayed at the a during a recent visit to Dubai  We needed a budget hotel  not easy in Dubai as another reviewer mentioned   and decided to go with the a because we really wanted something downtown and we wanted something clean  We loved the location  although I think we were lucky to have a room not on the main street   The staff was very friendly and helpful  Internet was available at a good rate  There are different categories of rooms  Indeed  this is not a   star hotel  The rooms are very big and our room was not modern  However  it was very clean and was cleaned every day  We had everything we needed  Breakfast was simple  but as we were on a budget  toast and coffee or tea was enough  Remember that there are different kinds of guests and everyone s idea of what is a good breakfast is different  If you want to just hang out at a pool at a hotel  pay the extra money and go for a more luxury hotel  You can find good deals online  Because we wanted some time to do this  we decided to pass the second half of our stay in a nicer hotel  Unfortunately  in the nicer hotel we had to pay extra for things like breakfast and couldn t just pop out to get a bottle of water or a quick snack or even just a pleasant evening walk  Overall  we particularly liked the location  the fact that it was very clean and safe  and would recommend it for couples on a budget  
N =>   Not a place to stay We had tried to book the property through number of well know web sites but couldn t got confirmation in due time  So decided to call them up and reserve it directly  They charged for triple room occupancy but upon arrival said all the rooms are booked and we have to take double room with extra bed and no refund  When we checked in the room found it is very smelly  wash room is broken  very horrible atmosphere  Up on complain to front desk they said it is the best room they have offered to us  After waiting for two hours with my kids in the lobby they were able to show two more rooms with similar problems but little less smell  We had no choice but stayed there  We paid about      a night for the room but the room hotel worth not more than     a night  The front entrance of the hotel was pretty neat and good but actual hotel inside  halls and rooms are not maintained in decades  Also there were broken AC electric switches  no iron and very creepy TV  We strongly recommend to AVOID the hotel  
N =>  Not too bad We stayed here for   nights and found it fine  The hotel is centrally located to shops  banks and restaurants  The museum is just walking distance  Rooms were spacious  Staff was curteous  Hotel is in a busy shopping area  but we didnt hear noise in the rooms  Breakfast was available and fresh omlette was made to order  
N =>  Really Disliked This Hotel We stayed in the a Hotel Dubai on the    and   th september  We had booked and paid for both nights however upon arriving at the hotel and finding the condition of the room to be unacceptable we left the following day and booked into another hotel  The porter excorted us to our room and I did try to keep a very open mind as I noticed that there was a curtain at the end of the passageway covering up some construction work  Hoping once he opened our door it would be better unfortunately it did not  The bedspread had cigarette burns in it   we did ask for non smoking  The room was really rundown  The bathroom had a shower rod that was held up by toilet tissue  There was a window which just looked out to a ugly wall  Construction work hammering started above our room at  am the next morning  I could not get out fast enough  We travel all over the world and travel for up to   months every year and have been doing this for   years now and we have stayed in thousands of hotels  I am sorry this one did not work out as I do not like posting bad reviews however i though the public should be aware  thanks ie Heady 
N => 	value This hotel offers tremendous value for money and location is very good    double delux rooms for   nights cost          Had   kids  amp    teenager as part of party  All was content and happy throughout our stay  Hotel staff very polite and ready to help    th floor shower not so good as low water pressure   got moved to  rd floor when mentioed it  Rooms were clean  spacious and we was nt worried about valubles   some of my party went gold buying  I thought location was great  Its in Old Dubai so out of the developing mertopolis which can be a good thing and many shops within hotel vicinity seem cheaper  bought mobile fone saving         Opposite the hotel is a fantastic Shawarma place  I noticed all locals and many staff eating there  I strongly advise to try the fruit cocktail  about   p   if they sold that here I reckon about        So so good and nothing artificial  Things to do   Desert driving  wadi water park  Burj Al arab tour  river cruise  amp  meal  all aranged from tour desk in hotel by independant staff but trust worthy  be I was lucky I dont know  but I booked this place after reading the reveiws  and anybody else doing the same I would recomend this place as a good  clean  cheap place to stay for someone who wants to rest  wash and eat breakfast and leave your belongings somewhere safe  If you want a hotel that has a swimming pool  yoga classes and in general just want to hang around the hotel it self rather than explore Dubai then you may not enjoy the a  
N =>   Gutes Hotel in zentraler Lage unweit von Dubai Creek und Museum  
N => This hotel is certainly not represeing Dubai hospitality I must say that this is my first time to book in the Dusit chain and i was extremely disappointed  I have booked a    bedroom suite for a   day vacation for my family with high expectation  The booking reservation that I got clearly mentioned check in time of     PM  I have arrived from another city at     Pm to find the hotel lobby full of families and I did not know why they are waiting  After check in  the receptionist told me that my room is not ready yet and it will be ready in   hour time  i e   pm which is already   hours after official time  and I have to wait like other families are waiting  The surprise is my room got ready       pm and we had to wait  hours for the room  I have complained to the hotel manager that this is not acceptable and that I have lost half a day that I have already for but he said he is sorry and he cant do much for me Once I checked in the room I found the room to be spacious but furniture very worn out and certainly not representing a  star hotel In addition to that  the amount of construction around the hotel is crazy and it took me more than    minutes to get to the hotel entrance  I have given my feedback to the corporate guest feedback of Dusit hoping this wont happen to any one elseI strongly advice any visitor to avoid this hotel  
N =>   Average but not average we have spent   night at the hotel  for the first two  there were no shampoo or body lotion just body shower gel    we had to call and ask if they had on the third night kitchenette is a bit smelly other than that everything was ok  
N =>  Okay hotel comfy bed I expected more from a hotel in Dubai but this one was okay  The room I stayed in was a suite and as such was quite large  The bed was comfortable and the toiletries in the bathroom were luxurious  One problem with the bathroom though   it was a little stinky  The smell was kind of damp  like there needed to be a window in there or something The hotel s pool is located on the top floor of the hotel and is clean  If you are looking for a sunny spot  wait until about noon or so to go up  The staff in this area were friendly and served free fruit to those sitting around the pool If you are in Dubai looking for luxury  this may not be your best bet  I was not overly impressed but because the room was clean and the room service was good I do not have any real complaints 
Nice alternative in Dubai The Dusit aims to give you a little chunk of Thailand for your stay in Dubai  It is very quiet  calm and mellow and this may appeal to some in this frenetic city  It s at the furthest end of the built up portion of Sheikh Zayed Rd  One immediate positive was the shorter transfer time ex DXB  Instead of getting snagged up on Sheikh Zayed Rd  there is a new ish back road running parralel which gets you there double quick The rooms were very pretty and under stated  above average on style points for Dubai  Standard rooms just fine for space  Good desk area by the window but expensive internet     aed per day  did mount up  You get some cute shutters in the bathroom  which you can fling open while soaking in the tub if you want to chat with your room mate watch the telly or gawp at the view This room had the best air conditioning I can remember  I thought it was broken at first  but no  it was just super quiet The roof top swimming pool was fun but be aware it is not particularly exposed and in shade for most of the day    or may not be a good thing   It was pretty quiet when I went up and a good sized pool  Has its own bar and you can get lunch there if you want Hotel bar was again quite mellow  but deserted and certainly  if you re alone  you ll feel like a plank with the constant attentiveness  bowing  praying hands etc  Ah yes  the regulation Piano Bar act too  Staff were very pleasant all round Well  that s the Dusit  Super quiet oasis of calm  very nice  slightly dull  
N =>   Fantastic Hotel but location leaves something to be desired  
N =>  Not bad enough to avoid not good enough to recommend Plus points   nice room  everything clean and working and more than adequate  Fridge in room  but no tea coffee facilities  big tv loads of channels  Nice hotel overall  big  light open spaces  the decor and feel were all fine  The online company we booked with  lastminute com  had messed up our reservation and though they provided flights for   adults and a child  the room was only booked for   adults  The hotel reception dealt with this extremely well  an extra bed was provided  with no extra charge  inc the extra breakfast  Hotel  extras  were quite reasonable Minus points  No balcony and absolutely no way therefore of drying wet beach stuff  there was a clothesline in the bathroom but due to the aircon  clothes put on it took   days to dry  Breakfast was ok  but uninspiring and they have a strange system for getting coffee   a waitress floats around with a jug every now and then  so if you just miss her  cycle  you will have finished eating before your next chance to get a drink  Reception concierge unhelpful about queries and requests  when we asked them to call us a taxi they offered the hotel car at four times the price  The free shuttle to from the beach failed to collect us on the second day  Our complaint query when we were forced to take a taxi back to the hotel met with no response Location is fine ish  ie its near the creek but a good    minutes walk to where its at  in terms of restaurants  souks etc Overall we were happy  we got a very good price deal and felt it was value for money  but it it was in the detail that it failed to deliver Oh  and its a dry hotel  so if you need a drink bar look elsewhere  
N =>   Great value hotel This hotel is good value for money  Very close to the airport    minutes drive  We initially booked for a family double room but that was upgraded to   bedroom suite  Which was nice  Although some of the furniture  sitting room  was showing some signs of wear and tear  The staff were helpful and very courteous  The swimming pool which was on the   floor was not so accessible but still fine The breakfast was adequate The hotel was clean and tidy  
N =>  Overpriced We found this hotel overpriced when one compares it with better hotels for half the price in places such as Singapore and Bangkok and would have included breakfast  It would rate as no more than three stars in Asia We found the service slack  Room not serviced until  pm  Bathroom floor not washed during our stay  Getting bell boy up to collect baggage took three attempts Stroppy attitude in business centre when using the internet  The retaining of passports even though accommodation had been paid for months in advance and almost leaving without them The Tent coffee shop needing    minutes to make a club sandwich despite there being only the two of us in the place  The mind boggles  We told them not to bother None of the above rates as a four star hotel in our opinion On the plus side it was in a central location and walkable distance to various locations  
N =>  Very disappointing experience  Requested to pay full amount upon arrival Request to keep passport as an additional guaranteeOne evening  back from work  I found the door of my room opened  They just forgot to close it after cleaning  fortunately  nothing was missing in my room  Some staff pay very few attention to the customer  enter in the room in the morning while you are sleeping without looking at the  quot Do not disturb quot  red indication hanging at the door s knob   Low dedication to customer satisfaction  with regards to internet connection recurring problems  laundry pick up and delivery  airport pick up  restaurant orders   Food choice is very limited  which is an inconvenient for long stay customers As a conclusion  I had a very bad experience in every field This hotel does not diserve its   stars  
N =>   Only a Hostel    not a Hotel One of the worst Hotel Apartments in the Middle East  Promise a lot in the internet   just as a marketing effect  not in reallyty  There is only the space of the flat ok   all other details are a not provided by staff and management  
N =>   NOT a   star  This hotel is not worthy a   star rating  upon arrival they forgot to send a driver at the airport  so we waited    mins  after begging to use a phone at the airport  then there were no appologies  room was not up to standard  shoddy paint  finishes  wonky tiles  no balconie  as they advertised  taxi service was terrible  have to croos a busy sandy road  breakfast is a free for all so called resteraunt is a basic room with plates of food  i have been to dubai   times  amp  never seen flies in dubai hotels   but come here and you will in the food area  NO BAR    staff were polite  but thats the best point  i won t go back there  reccomend oasis beach hotel  hilton  metropolitan  to name a few  I BOOKED THROUGH EXPEDIA  next time i ll stick to best at dubai holidays  
N =>   Didnt live up to our expectations This hotel should NOT be rated a     star  I have paid less and had better services from many other hotels  A week before arriving at the hotel I emailed them and requested a baby cot  I said i was willing to bring our travel cot if they didnt have any  I was reassured that there would be a cot available and not to worry  I was also told breakfast was complimentary  Well  we arrived at the hotel on the   th ch and noticed that the hotel was somewhat overcrowded and that reception were not particularly welcoming  Our two bedroom suite was on the   th floor which we didnt mind  and was really the highlight of our stay  We had every comfort we needed in our suite and the state of furniture decor was perfect  In fact it was the best suite we ever stayed in  The kitchen had every facility and provision   just as we would have in our own home  minus the food of course   HOWEVER  there was no baby cot  In fact no cot arrived even though i kept being assured one was on its way  in fact  a mattress turned up at  am at night  with my toddler happily bouncing around for most of the night  It was really upsetting  The hotel now admitted there were no cots available  and insisted that i should be happy with the mattress especially as they werent charging me for it  WELL  a baby cot would have been complimentary anyway  so yes it should be free at no extra charge The next morning we went down to breakfast   and what a disappointement  no plates left  no cutlery  no juice  no tea and barely any food  Many people were left disappointed as there really wasnt anything to eat  After I complained and threatened to take it up with the manager  they started to send in some scraps  but by then we were really put off The hotel was not at the standard of a   star  in terms of service   very poor  probably   or   maximum  the suite was very nice and yes probably   star  You need to decide which is more important  Personally I will not return there again  even though we had the perfect suite  The hotel is on a building site and while we heard no noise  the surroundings arent very pleasant  A very nice restaurant just down the road   Karachi Durbar that sells asian food at good prices As for the hotel  i would not recommend it  The staff need to be trained in customer satisfaction and be more welcoming to guests  
N =>   Not that good This hotel was rated   stars hotel  In my opinion   stars is max  Service was slow and Hotels restaurant was awfull  Gym was small and there was no pool  In march      hotel was located in the middle of construction site  
N =>   don t be sure that it s a four star hotel  if it was up to me i would give them only one star   from the first moment you enter the hotel you find out that the staff workin at the reception are very impolite  although it s an international hotel they can t speak in any other languages  yo can t get what they say when they speak english      the food was very very bad  and the resturant smelled all the time it was really disgusting the room service was even worst remember not to exchange you money in the hotel  it is more reasonable to exchange it in shopping malls or any place out of that hotel the swimming pool was so small that only    people could get into water  and i mean just get into pool not swim it only had space for   people to swim at the same time  i did nt like there at all and i don t recomment it to anyone else  it just wasting your money  
N =>   good place for starving I have been to many hotels before but this hotel was the worst of all  since we traveled to Dubai in ramadan  there were no other places to eat lunch so we had to eat at hotel and you can t believe how terrible the food was  the resturant was cold and smelled awful all the time  on the whole the food was disgusting  the room service was terrible  do not forget to bring your own shampoo blanket and personal stuff cause you ll not find a toothpaste tooth brush slippers comb or any thing you may expect to find in a four star hotel  The most unpleasant part for me was the guys at the reception part  who were impolite and couldn t speak english fluently I do not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel there are many   star hotels in Dubai with more facilities than this terrible four star hotel                 
N =>  Fantastic experience My husband and I had a   night stay here  I found that this hotel was a great option as a lot of the cheaper places seemed to have nightclubs in the same buildings or were in bad areas  The staff here were great and when the padlock on one of our bags broke and meant we couldn t unlock it  they got the maintenece guy to help us with bolt cutters  I would recommend getting the transfers from the airport as we were stuck in traffic due to all the roadworks that were going on  and even though taxis are cheap there  wouldn t have wanted to be stuck in traffic that long in a taxi  Upon arrival we got a glass of apple juice to refresh us while we were checking in and the porters took our bags up to our room  The porter also gave us a run down on the room  how to work air con  etc  and told us about the pool and spa  The room was massive and felt quite luxurious  The rooftop pool was also a good place to hang out  Lots of shaded deck chairs and a life guard always on duty  Having a    hours cafe on site was also handy  Buffet breakfasts were amazing with so much choice  The hotel also had free shuttle buses to a mall and the beach  
N =>   excellent hotel This was a lovely hotel  We  my husband   boys and i  arrived at approx  am and were able to check in immediately due to their    hor check in facility and we were also upgraded to executive connecting rooms which were great  lovely clean and spacious  It was the first hotel i stayed in which had really comfortable pillows in it The staff were really friendly and helpful  getting taxis and sorting out everything  Breakfast was good with a good variety  We ordered room service and it was really good and inexpensive  The hotel was in a really nice location near to airport and the creek  
Not amazing but perfectly suitable I m a business traveller and I ve been a bit stumped for a word to describe this hotel  I think I ll go with  quot contradictory quot  On the upside   the rooms are mostly suites with separate living and bedroom areas   no shortage of space    the beds are very comfortable and the decor is modern  the toiletries provided are delightful  if that s important to you  the bath is large  so if you need a soak after a long flight  it s great  And the towels are luxurious   the internet access is fast  On the expensive side but pretty normal for business hotel prices   televisions in both the living and bed rooms  good room service  two smaller shopping malls within easy walking distance  and a great concierge if you want to book a cab to go to one of the larger  more popular malls On the downside   dreadful service  Reception is as slow as anything I ve ever seen  although that appears to be the norm in the Emirates   My colleague and I were ready to chew our arms off and flee by the time they managed to check us both in out   the rooms smell damp  most likely because the air conditioning is running all the time  But it was quite strong and it took a while before I stopped noticing it   Most of Dubai is a construction site  but this area was awful  No footpaths  diverted traffic everywhere   not easy to walk even a short distance    There s no desk near the internet connection  I had to work on my lap in the living room  which was less than idea  There was a desk in the bedroom but no internet connection point Personally I don t think this was great value for money at all  In fact I d say it was a nice enough hotel but a bit overpriced for what was on offer  although not by overall Dubai standards I guess I stayed in Sharjah for four days after this  at the Millennium  and was very much more impressed with the hotel  service and value for money  When I go back to work in the region next time  I will return to Sharjah and leave Dubai in the rear view mirror  
N =>   More than a  star I stayed in Flora Grand Hotel based on the riviews in Trip AdvisorBeing the exhibition time it was little difficult to find rooms in Dubai but managed to get the rooms by booking directly with hotel  Standard rooms were sold out and executive room were available with breakfast and airport transfers complimentary  I got an early check in which was unexpected as i was been informed that they will try while making the booking  Room was good spaciuos with duvet neat and clean and breakfast was also good with a live counter  I didnt get the chance to try the Monsoon Restaurant  had a visit upto the roof level were you have a well equipped fitness centre and massage aswell  Have to try the same on next visit  Good hotel neatly maintained with friendly staff and nice service  
Nice hotel shame about the service    My friend and I stayed at the Flora Grand Hotel based on the reviews given on trip advisor and whilst we were happy with the facilities provided by the hotel   rooftop pool  use of the gym  breakfast  etc  we were left feeling frustrated and disappointed with the service  Each time we needed to confirm something or book something it took a VERY long time to do and seemed to always be a big problem  There were many mis communications   I felt that the level of English required should be higher than was provided  Checking in and out was HARD WORK  We tried to remain positive and to enjoy our stay in Dubai but I must say I would NOT recommend The Flora Grand Hotel to anyone else  I have heard from locals that the IBIS Hotel is very good in comparison  Another tip is that Deira is located approx       mins from Jamiera which where most of the attractions in Dubai are  I hope this helps shape your decision when choosing a hotel in Dubai  
N =>  surprisingly good quality for   star daughter and i stayed here for   nights  even though much building going on in dubai  this hotel was very quiet and well located  first impression very positive with small but classy lobby area  gorgeous chandelier  clean and neat looking with plenty of areas to sit down staff friendly and most importantly  extremely nice to nine year old  staff always nodded and smiled when we walked past them  and even made time to talk to daughter  prompt and efficient service at checkin out  very polite and friendly also  luggage handled promptly room quite spacious with two large beds  chairs and a desk  large wardrobe  very nice marble bathroom with bidet  which was quite hilarious as had to explain to daughter what it was  prospect of unlimited water and great pressure lovely after drought back home  so spent a long time in shower   shower in bath   room very clean and had individually controlled airconditioning   the maximum temperature was    degrees while we were there  there is no balcony  but due to heat probably good idea as you wouldnt be able to sit out there for long  lovely white towels in plentiful supply  toiletries supplied  room made up quickly and discreetly only small pool area on top of hotel but very welcome  can order drinks there that are charged to room  very hot up there however  but has excellent views over dubai  there was also a staff member there at all times  which is great for supervision as pool is quite deep  breakfast substantial and plenty of choice for small hotel  but yoghurt not kept refrigerated  lovely dining room  but did not eat in other restaurants due to time limits and excursions no mistakes or problems whatsoever during time there   even though we arrived at midnight due to flight problems  and we left at     am  pickups drop offs all arrived prompty all in all  for a   star hotel an excellent property  small  polite  quiet  clean  safe  enough niceties without extra frills and fuss for a great price  fine for all groups  including women travelling alone and children  would recommend on that alone  as some places can make children feel invisible  there are probably bigger and fancier places to stay in dubai  but this property more than satisfied  would love to come back well done  some   star hotels should take note  
N => excellent    excellent   star hotel  excellent service and exellent food at both the coffee bar aswell as the restaurant  if not alittle expensive   only downsize was no internet access which was alittle disappointing  would befo recommend and go back again     
N =>  good service  
N =>  A little disappointed  
N =>   Rude staff bad service  A guy entered my room when I was naked I have been twice in this hotel because my travel agency works with them and I was not able to plan for my travel  The staff simply ignore your requests for anything even a wake up call is considered as extra service   In my first travel october        I arrived at night and the transportation to hotel arrived late at the airport  Then they gave me a room in the  nd floor  I did not know that there are two discos in the first floor and I could not sleep until   AM because of the disco s sound  The next time aug       I asked for a room in upper floors and they gave me one in  th floor  I was naked in my room shaving when some guy entered my room with one of the hotel stuff  I was really shocked  The reception had given him the same room as mine  I do not know how it can happen     They did not come for transportation and I took a taxi  The food was good in my first trip but in the second  it was spicy  Furthermore the restaurant was full if you were a little late and you should stay in the lobby while others are eating  there is not enough couches in the lobby   Fish and chips was only chips and nobody cared to fill the fish dish again  Very bad service when they are a little busy Their English is terrible and you can hardly understand what they say  I do not recommend it to anybody  Go to another   star hotel  This time I am going to Ibis    stars  but I won t go to Fortune again  
Nice enough good location This hotel was nice enough for our brief trip to Dubai  The room was clean and of a reasonable size  though its not what you d call luxury Staff on the front desk and in the bar weren t the best  one lady on reception could be quite rude and the chap behind the bar didn t seem to understand what we were saying a lot of the time Breakfast was okay  although some of the things on offer seemed a little strange All in all this hotel served us well for our short stay  
Nice Hotel Not to be confused with the Fortune Hotel which is in Deira I stayed at this hotel during the Arabian Travel t  It is a time when hotels can be difficult to find and have rediculously high rates  By the way  Dubai hotels are these days rediculously expensive anyways I got a single room for     usd  The hotel apartment was recent renamed to fortune hotel apartment and is just behind the office tower of ABN AMRO located on the main bank street in Bur Dubai  This hotel is around   minutes walk from Bur Juman which is about a   block walk There is a good mosque across the bank street road  There is also a good supermarket nearby and decent places to eat as its a office district The rooms were clean  breakfast was sufficient and staff was friendly  Would recommend this place  
Not so good Fortune This hotel is classed as   star  but I wouldn t rate it that highly  We stayed for   nights  The room was usual basic standard and the bed was comfortable but I failed to get another pillow after repeated requests The bathroom and loo weren t cleaned properly and it was hit or miss how many towels and facecloths we got between the   of us each day  One day the room wasn t cleaned until  pm The noise from the nightclub   floors down was audible  so must be really noisy if you re closer  The pool was small and on the roof  we didn t try it but the gym was ok Breakfast was buffet style and although there was plenty of choice  the hot food was stone cold on two mornings  Despite numerous members of staff hanging around they were always out of hot water  milk etc  The only coffee was instant Don t eat in the restaurant in the evening  We did one night and were served with a plate of bones and rice     I think it was supposed to be biryani  The staff were polite enough but service of variable standard Dubai is a fascinating place and the people friendly  I would recommend staying in the Deira side of the creek  just not this particular hotel  
N => Civil but not friendly tired hotel  staff not very friendly  Very noisy until  am  
N =>   meh  Stayed here while attending GITEX  Room was fine   I was upgraded because SPG Gold  and room was just OK   nothing to write home about  Terrible hot water   took   minutes to warm up and then tepid at best  Just provide simple soap  amp  shampoo   would expect a little more in a   star  Room was clean and recently renovated  comfy bed  Service was good   no problems getting things done  although they never did figure out not to knock on my door at     h and I didn t have a  do not disturb  sign  Internet rates a ripoff at   DHS a day  Absolutely disgusting and terrible    DHS buffet for dinner   compared to other options  this is about the worst food in Dubai I ve eaten  Ripoff hotel car coerced me to take a ride that should ve been about   DHS in a regular taxi  cost    DHS  Why do hotels sponsor   allow these con artists to hang around  All in all  an average stay  I d stay there again for a moderately priced room during peak season  but would explore other options first  
N =>   Hotel is good but the service is very poor The rooms are huge and comfy but unfortunately the service was not upto the mark  The hotel it seems have been done up recently only  Further they charge for water which works out a lot more in cost basis The english pub was good and the staff was good at the same Breakfast was also pretty good 
N =>   Good hotel nothing to get excited about I ve been there last ober  good hotel but something less than the other Four Points in Dubai  Clean room  a good location if you re a businessman since the hotel is very close to the business district  
Not worth for the money I spent If you look for a modern and upscale Hotel in Dubai  do not choose this one  Expensive rooms for what Hotel offers  cheap lobby  ridiculous swimming pool  like a bath tube   tiny fitness room and small restaurant  Friendly staff  
N =>   Great valuegood locationeasy  We found this hotel to be better than expected  The check in was fine at  am  not a problem  We got to the room and it had   beds so we asked to change and we were given a kingbed room straight away  It was very roomy and the bed was the best I have ever slept in  No noise so we slept very well  Walked to the Burjamin Mall the next morning for breakfast which was only a short stroll away  There is a supermarket a few doors now from the hotel as well  It is a lovely walk down to the creek and then we got a boat across to see the gold souk  Dubai was a disapointing in that it was hard to get around as you had to take taxis everywhere and it wasn t easy to find decent places to eat except your hotel  It is still just a big construction sight in the desert with shopping malls and new buildings  
N =>   Horrible service and not a four star hotel by any standards I booked a room called  quot comfy room quot  on the  th floor of this hotel  I choose this hotel entirely due to the good reviews on trip advisor First the hotel is in the middle of no where and is situated in a constructin worker housing area with horrible odor of sweat in the airWhen I enterd the hotel there was no one there to take the luggage  I was asked to deposit     dollars US     this seemed very high since usuaully hotels do not ask for     dollars or   night room cost in advance in case you use services after   minuites the bell boy came from his smoke break and took my luggage in  My arrival time was approximatly      Am  To the best of my understanding and having been to over    diffrent hotels across the world the normal check in time is       PM    this hotel had a      Pm check in time which meant after a    hour flight I could not take a shower or rest  I was told to go to the pool on the roof and take a shower their    I found this very odd and unprofessional of a so called   star hotel  the hotel by no means was   stars  especially by Dubai Standards of good hotels  I would give this hotel a   and thats pushing it  Now regarding the breakfast  I was charged     DHS for breakfast while it was actually in my reservations and paid for  I dident pay of course but it was a hassle  The food was not   star at all  the fruits were canned and not fresh and the meats were very cold and dry  I am not a picky person but this was very unacceptable  The room it self was good and spacious with the minor issues of bathtub and sinks being dirty  The Air conditoning which you can set your self would turn off in the middle of the night making sleeping very difficult as well  All in all i would not recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure  Before I forget the interent was free only on the lobby floor and was ridiculously slow  The room rate for the internet was the eqivilanet to     per hour which was really suprising given the slow speed of     MB per second  I would not suggest this hotel to anyone because it is all just a big headache  I was only at the hotel for   days and only spend the time their eating breakfast and sleeping since I was going to business meetings everyday but all in all not a good hotel even for a few hours  
N =>   The worst   points in Dubai This hotel does not qualify as a Four Points  especially compared with the other   in Dubai  The whole hotel is in need of extensive make over  The room has seen better days  
N =>   Value for money It was nice and new hotel with proximity to most of the places I wanted to travel  Good hospitality  
N =>   Value for money with Luxuary My company has choosen this hotel for all our executives to stay on our business trips  From the front desk to check out  the services were exelent and up to the standard  I used to stay most of the hotel chains including  star hotels  world wide This hotel gave me the satisfactions when ever I have a chance to stay  
N =>   never again From the moment we entered this horrible place i was annoyed  the receptionist was rude and our room was not ready so they offered us a smoking room which we took because we needed to rest after flying in from oman but the room was stinking and there was construction workers outside so couldnt open window changed rooms again only to find that we should have been in the excecutive suite which we were charged for  stayed for   nights but would not recommened it ever 
Nice location clean hotel friendly staff good value I stayed at Four Points by Sheraton on Khalid Bin Waleed Rd for two nights  The room I got was clean and nice  The staff was very helpful for my needs  There is free wifi in the lobby  they have charge for room internet access   a nice small swimming pool  a couple of options for food etc This is walking distance to the Burjaman shopping center and other places in Bur Dubai  Overall good value for money as I got a good rate directly from the hotel s web site  
N =>   Average Chose this hotel because of location  Came for a short shopping trip  This hotel is near to the BurJuman Shopping Mall  Located on a busy road  Starbucks nearby  Taxis easy to get  The room was average  there was no iron or ironing board  The hotel has an Indian theme  Hotel has various restaurants which I didnt get a chance to try  Whilst I was there  there was an Indian wedding and an Indian conference being held consecutively  
N =>   Not again Firstly  the concierge was superb  And the bed was comfortable BUT      It was in a grotty bit of the city  very claustrphobic area and when outside we struggled with the lack of fresh air  We were put up here due to a problem with our flight  and I would not go there ever again  The view from our room was of the work ojn the block next door  they started work at      a m  on the Sunday    The bed was so comfy  and we did sleep well until the builders started  The bathroom was fairly clean  but not to the standard i expected  There were cracks in the tiling and the floor tiles were very uneven  We had half board  but when it came to our evening meal  we discovered that it was for a limited price  which meant that if we had wanted wine with our meal  we were limited to our main course  as it was a fanta orange and a rump steak fitted in with the cost  but it wasn t fancy for the price  
N =>   nice hotel Nice hotel  reasonable location  Had a few issues initially  but after sorting these out our   night stay was ok  Staff was wonderful  could not have been more helpful although not always terribly efficient  Breakfast was great  
N => Ok but charge too much as compared to their standard The hotel was not as good as I expected it to be  Being Four Points hotel  i expected the services to be good but it was no more than just an ordinary   star motel  
N =>   Nice hotel We stayed   nights in this hotel  and had a wonderful stay  Positive  The staff was always very helpful  They did their best to help us with anything we needed  I liked the pool area a lot  It was nice and quiet  sometimes I had it to myself  It was sunny all day  and a very nice place to relax  There s also a jacuzzi  We chose this hotel because of the convenient location compared to the price  Anything more central was a lot more expensive  The food from the room service menu was good  both the breakfast and the all day menu  It was usually pretty easy to get a taxi from the hotel when we were going somewhere  Negative  The negative things are tiny and not important  but if I must say something negative  here they are Some of the staff didn t speak English very well  We ordered steak with bernaise sauce from the room service menu  just like we had the day before  but this time they called us back after taking our order and said  quot I m sorry  we don t have lebanese sauce quot   It took a couple of minutes to explain that we wanted bernaise sauce  Also a couple of other times they had problems with understanding us  but they were still very helpful  The shower seems old  It annoyed me that you couldn t use a handheld shower or adjust the height  The reception told us that the showers would be replaced within the summer  so hopefully that won t be a problem anymore then  Overall I really liked this hotel  I wouldn t mind staying here again if I ever go to Dubai and still don t want to spend a fortune on one of the luxury resorts  
Nice but avoid Tuesday night Really good placed in the hearth of Bur Dubai     minutes walking to Dubai Museun and Dubai Creek  where there are the main souks in town  The hotel is clean and confortable  the restaurants are great  the only inconvenience was the noissy tuesday night  in order there is usually a party in Touch Disco at the mezzanine Floor Staff was proffesional and kind all the time Pool  jacuzzi  Sauna and Gym are well equiped Good ambiance at Viceroy pub  
N =>   not bad ok location dubai is expensive if you want to be central and this hotel was also close to      per night but everywhere else better in a similar location was even more expensive older hotel that does need some updating but actually the rooms where fine  good size and good quality  
N =>  Would not recommend this to anyone This was a preferred hotel from my company and a nonsmoking room was booked by the corporate travel agency  Upon arrival only a smoking room was available  and the room was disgusting  As a business traveler arriving after midnight this was not what I had anticipated  My room was changed the next day  fortunately it was nonsmoking but noticed there must be no air cleaner as there is a lingering cigarette smell in the air  The room was equally run down as the first  at least the toilet worked this time  I was extremely disappointed to see how run down the rooms are  the walls and curtains could be cleaned  Stains on the pillows should be removed as this is very unsanitary  the lounge chairs require cleaning or reupholstering  so does the desk chair  Visually this was traumatic for me and I would never recommend staying at this place  Its a good thing I brought hand cleaner and travel wipes to clean around the room as I was scared to touch anything  The staff is mediocre at the hotel and cannot really say much  The only advantage for this hotel is that it is in the financial district  however a cab ride is cheap    find someplace else to stay  
Nice and acceptable I stayed in this hotel dozens of times  Not because I choose it but because my company gets corporate rate over there The announced price is really very high and the hotel doesn t worth that much money Rooms are clean and tidy  Food is good  Prices are acceptable Location is excellent  in banks road and near computer shopping malls  Overall pleasant stay with no remarkable problems Some negative points  to justify the rating     Standard room is small    Over priced   less value for money    Very indian oriented   although I love indian food and indian music    but I hate it when once culture dominates all the others  This is clear about the food taste and accent of the staff  If you can eat spicy food   this hotel is your best place  
Nice hotel well located Very comfortable beds  good location  nice breakfast  
N =>  Good Hotel   Good Deal It is too bad the others did not have the same experience I had with this hotel  This is a very good example of the fact you don t have to pay a fortune to get a good hotel room in Dubai  I checked in around  am and although there was some confusion about the date of my arrival  the front desk went out of their way to help and once I got to my room the room service was excellant  I found the hotel to be clean  quiet and in a great neighborhood  The staff was professional  helpful and I will absolutely return as well as recommend this hotel to my friends  
N =>  hotel service leaves much to be desired   Two executive rooms booked between           amp          My daughter  on her honeymoon  given a room       which and  for obvious reasons  I only realised after   days was double the size of mine        Confirmed by staff that mine was not of executive standard    Service sloppy   bed linen not changed every day  towels occasionally missing  soap not provided on one occasion  minibar not replinished regularly  inability to cope with a rush of guests for breakfast   Charged double fares for tours  refunded when I actually realised and complained    Complained on various occasions at front desk  No result  Tried to get an appointment with Manager  Not available  Eventually a very sympathetic  well dressed fellow came over  He offered his sympathy and asked how he could compensate us for all the mishaps  In a spirit of conciliation I told him not to bother but send my party    people  a glass of champagne at midnight on New Years  Eve  I am afraid that even this did not materialise  I am not amused and will publish on my website Dr  Joseph Ignatius Vella MD 
N =>   Great Stay  I went with my family for the first time to Dubai   I loved my stay but I don t think the other members of my family did  It s always the smell of any hotel that bothers me the most as I don t like such smells haha but you just get used to it  The staff were really friendly especially the travel desk  we didn t know where places were and what we could do and he was very helpful   thanks to him we knew were we were going  or else we would have been lost  Most shops are walking distance so that was good  If your staying ther for a few nights or weeks I recommand this hotel for sure     
N =>  few helpfull staffs i was staying there with my family for   nights  the hotel is centrally located so it was very easy to go around the city  though the rooms were not as spacious as i required  i have   childrens also  but there were few staff who were really very helpful  this was the first time in dubai  amp  a guy from the travel desk named Deboo  was very helpful  his job was only to sell tours  but he guided me in all the ways he could  he went out of his way to get my room early  amp  even arranged to get a room which is on the roadside  he was the only one who made my trip easier  unfortunately i was already booked for the tours  so i wasnt able to try his  but i m sure  next time i gonna book everything through him  next person was caroline  she is in the reception  amp  she was the only person behind the reception who was carrying a smily  amp  didnt had any attitude  the overall experience was good  i would surely recomend this hotel to others if they r couples or groups or even those people who have children but they should take   rooms Mr  S R  
N =>  Very comfortable hotel We stayed at this hotel for   nights  It was in a good location   about    minutes to the aiport  But i the location of Crowne Plaza was better than this hotel  We chose to stay here because they offered to let us check in early in the morning  The rooms were very comfortable and clean  bfast was good  Staff was excellent 
N => 	to the Four Points Sheraton We stayed in this Sheraton for   nights in ch       I was accompanying my husband on a business trip and I selected this hotel based on loyalty brand and location  Despite a pretty unassuming facade  the interior was much more inviting  Check in was smooth and we were upgraded to a deluxe room  which was spacious  clean  but best of all  the bed and bedding was divine  in fact  a Heavenly Bed  Room service was prompt  the gym was small but effective and the trainer knowledgeable  This hotel is in a very good location on the right side of the Creek  Easy access to all the tourist sights and in particular  not too far from the Gold Souk and Goldland  We are returning to Dubai in ember and will be staying at Four Points Sheraton again  
N =>   got more than what we expected  highly recommeneded  thank you great hotel with great location  the arriving did nt start as pleasant as we would have liked    we arrived   hours before check in time and were charged us     extra but we did not care once we checked to our two bedroom apatment    every thing was so nice and celan   the two bedroom apartments are massive  as first time in dubai  we didnt book any sieght seeing but the tourist booking centre guys were great  the children absolutely loved the pool on the roof and the bar and wifi was great  all taxi driveres know where the hotel is     we will be returning to dubai next year and i will not look at any thing else apart from this hotel     excellent apartments   excellennt pool  excellent staff   very very happy customer  
N =>   Friendly clean and comfortable with a cool pool  When researching where to stay in Dubai within the mid price bracket I came across this hotel but was unable to find any information on their website about swimming pool temperature control  I knew it was on the rooftop and not huge but my biggest concern was whether it would be refreshing  I ve been to Bali over the new year period and the pools where like a warm bath due to the climate   yuck  Knowing the Dubai temperature was going to be around    degrees I wanted to be sure I could cool off in the heat of the day AND I COULD  I m not sure if they refrigerate the water going through the filtration pump but the pool was the welcome relief I needed  Overall we found this hotel great value  We had a very clean and comfortable room with a great big comfy bed and the staff where very friendly  A particular thanks to Gerard who introduced himself to us as we where sitting around the pool deck waiting to be checked in  we where early   He hurried up the room for us and made a point of seeking us out each day  asking how our stay was going  what we where doing and generally making us feel special To other TA contributors   thanks so much for the warnings about providing the right Sheraton details to the taxi drivers  there are   in Dubai   Whilst we did have some  quot lost in translation quot  issues with taxi drivers being unable to find certain restaurants and souks  we always managed to get the driver to understand exactly which   Points we where staying at  
N =>   Interesting hotel to stay in I found the hotel interesting with a mixture of attentive staff let down by a very poor restaurant for breakfast  The rooms were very nice and a good size for both working in and relaxing  The bed was very comfortable and the layout of the remainder of the furniture relaxing  I normally have breakfast in the hotel I am staying in as this overcomes the need to have lunch during a working day  I found that the breakfast in this hotel was not of a high standard and that staff were not serving their customers  Getting coffee was a hit or miss affair as they have no visible coffee service  You have to chase staff up to get it  The range of food was not very good  During my   day stay I put up with the breakfast twice which convinced me to go elsewhere  Because of my breakfast experience I never tried to have dinner there  The major annoying feature was the towels provided they were very poor quality sandpaper like with limited drying ability  The management should try them out before inflicting them on their guesses  As for the costs of the internet connections I can but say there are some people trying to get rich quick  It was an outrageously overpriced  I cannot remember where I ever paid this much for a connection  I would considering staying at this hotel again  
N =>  Awesome     Very Tolerant  Our ship arrived in Dubai for an    day stop  A few of the crew decided to get a hotel for   nights  The price was really good and the hotel wasn t to far away from Port Rashid The staff we re extremley friendly and managed to check    of us in  with hardly any snags  Some of the lads got checked in later when they arrived  There was never a problem gettting taxi s  the only problem was getting the driver to understand where we wanted to go The room service was excellent  Very fast and always correct  I thought we would have a problem ordering our corona breakfast  but no  at  ish in the morning     bottles of corona arrived for our breakfast    Result The room was made up while we were out  which was not expected  but rather nice all the same  Overall  a very nice friendly hotel  very tolerant of our drinking  High possiblities of staying at this hotel during our visit to Dubai next year A   
N =>  Very good apart from    The   bedroom suite was fantastic really a   bedroom suite with an adjoining bedroom  there was   full bathrooms    plasma screen TVs  Check in was friendly and the staff were very nice through out apart from refusing to cook us some Gluten free pasta for our little boy who has Coeliac disease  this is the first time any where in the world any where has refused to help us They did lend us a small pan for our room but we really had to push to get this after they initially refused to lend us a pan Also be aware that the suites do have a kitchen but they have NOTHING in the kitchen but a   ring hob  fridge freezer and no plates  cups  cutlery etc P S internet is way too expensive  
N =>   Interesting observations I went to Dubai for   days          everyone kept saying thats too short and too long a flight to travel   coming from NY  but am glad i spent on   days  you can pretty much do everything dubai has to offer in that amount of timeAnyway the Four point sheraton downtown  is a decent hotel  they say its   stars  i would give it a      Service is good  people are attentive and friendly  which helps when in a foreign coutryHowever  what turned me off is that the nite before i was leaving dubai  i went to the Front desk to go over my bill and sort it out and gave the my credit card  for some reason  it didnt work  later found out my credit company Bank Of America thought  fraud was being committed and stopped the transaction So i asked the hotel to call the merchant for me and they said they have no international access that i should call myself  i was horrified and shocked  how can a hotel which claims to cater to people from all over the world not have access to calling merchants  Even Macy s dept store would call  I was finally able to sort my bill out by using a friends credit cardbut that got me thinking  what if no one was there to help  or i had no money  then what would i have done  they offered no option for me  for this i am disapointed in the hotel and probably wouldnt recommend it for that  really really big turn off for meNote to hotel figure out a better way to help customers when they are stranded 
N =>   Pleasant hotel friendly staff quiet but central location We visited Dubai for three nights over Ramadan and the Eid holiday  We had two double rooms on a non smoking floor  Pros  The rooms were very well equipped and were very clean  The beds were comfortable and the room service was prompt  Staff were very helpful  The rooftop pool was pleasant  with deck chairs  a toddlers  pool and a bar  I m not sure that you would choose this hotel if you were coming to Dubai to lie in the sun  though   there are plenty of resort style hotels that would be a better choice  This was a good choice for a tourist or business stopover  however  as it was centrally located but relatively quiet  Cons  not in an area where you can leave the hotel and stroll to nearby restaurants  If you like that sort of thing  try the beach walk hotels  i e  hilton   You will also need a taxi  cheap  however  or car if you want to get to malls and tourist sites  
N =>   New and very Dubai  We stopped at the Sheraton for just one night on our arrival into Dubai  Got a good deal via Airmiles and as we arriving late in the evening just wanted somewhere to sleep which wasn t too far from the airport  This place did not disappoint  Looked to be new builing  very friendly reception staff  our room was MASSIVE  including a lounge area  I m sure we d only selected a standard room  but it definitely was something more  Breakfast was included in the rate  very good  lots of choice  We would definitely stay here again and for longer  looked to be a good location in Bur Dubai and not too far from Sheikh Zayed Rd  
N =>   Accommodating Staff and lovely hotel I would like to say that we had a lovely stay at this hotel  As we booked under   different names we found that our rooms were not together however the genetleman Indika  I made a point of getting his name  at reception was more than happy to search for rooms so that were together  He was even kind enough to show us the rooms before we committed to which level we wanted to stay in  Eventaully we got   interconnecting rooms     with   twin beds and   with a massive king bed  I am sure we booked a classic room but we ended up in a preferred room which had the extras like gown   complimentary water and Ipod dock  The rooms were spacious and well layed out and the bathroom was clean and did not smell  The room service was good and the concierge staff were very informative and hailed taxi s for us  The roof top pool was very nice however the sunbeds would get taken up quickly so best to get there eary and not like us after  pm  The only thing is that there isn t much of a view from the hotel window but the hotel is conviently located  About   mins in taxi to Meena Bazaar and and about    mins in taxi to Wild Wadi  All in all it was a lovely experience and would recommend definately to stay in this hotel  
N =>   A decent stay The hotel exterior didn t quite look like a hotel   more like a service apartment set up  Rooms are comfortable  amp  clean  We got a room on the starwood floor but it was without a view  Friendly  amp  attentive staff at reception  housekeeping  amp  room service  Don t like the taxi services  hotel staff seems to always push for the private taxis which charge more  amp  no meter  We practically have to take taxi to just about everywhere  Breakfast is decent but does not have an egg station so it s scrambled eggs everyday   Gym room is good  Equipment is in decent condition  Swimming pool is a small kidney shaped pool  
N =>   Excellent We had a great time at the Four Points by Sheraton Downtown  we were upgraded to a Starwood Prefered Guest Room free of charge as they did not have the room we had booked  The room was excellent  Location about    mins from the airport  The Concierges were very knowledgeable and helpful  they organised   trips we wanted to go on at short notice without a problem  I would recomend this hotel  
N =>   I want to go back    We loved this hotel  From the friendly cleaning staff to the manager   they were all brilliant We arrived at  am and had to wait until after    to get our room as we wanted a junior suite   no smoking  As there was still no room available  they gave us an upgrade  Oh wow  We just loved our room s  so much Could have stayed there for a few weeks no problem The swimming pool was so nice and clean and a good depth for not so good swimmers like us The concierge gave us so much help   answering all our questions There is a shop around the corner  turn right as you leave the hotel  with a good range of groceries   all very cheap for us We intend to return to Dubai in ober  but this hotel is so much more expensive to book then and we ll maybe have to find a cheaper alternative  
N =>  good facilities a well equiped centraly located hotel  easy to get around  everything at a distance of   to   km away overall  a comfortable smooth stay  
N =>  excellent hotel with friendly staff Stayed here for   nights and found our room to be very clean with all mod cons    lifts were available and no time to wait for them  On arrival we were allocated a room right away even though it was     am  Received complimentary card with a selection of beverage food to be used in restaurant  Complimentary bottle of water each day in room  Bathroom had nice big bath  very good shower  toilet  washhand basin and bidet  Towels were changed on a regular basis  Air conditioning was very quiet so able to leave on overnight  Swimming pool on top of hotel had a controlled heated pool  but was always busy during our stay  All staff within the hotel were very courteous and very professional in their duties  Nearest shopping centre was Burjuman and was within walking distance  
N =>  A Sparkling Clean Hotel I thought the Four Points by Sheraton Downtown Dubai was great  The hotel just gleamed it was so clean and nice  The room was spacious and they had a nice restaurant and coffee shop  The hotel seems to be well managed and the staff all seemed happy and friendly  As I was travelling on my own this trip I was pleased to see at Dubai airport that they have a ladies only taxi service  This meant that I had a lady taxi driver that drove me to the hotel  and I thought this was a great service as I know there have been alot of problems there in the past for single female travellers  
N =>   Great Hotel   Great Service  We have just returned from a   day stay in Dubai on our way home from Cairo I had booked the hotel online as was worried I might have made a bad choise  I was so pleased I definitely made the right choice  What a great hotel  It was so clean   Chrome  amp  Mirrors in the lifts were sparkling   the service was efficient and staff were friendly  very helpful and always smiling  The breakfast selection was excellent  The room we had was very spacious and clean  Bathroom was also a good size  however we had to remove the bath plug cover to allow the water to drain whilst showering as using the lever didnt lift it high enough to let the water drain properly  Good quiet air conditioning system and a nice big TV which is great to watch when you come back to your room to relax after being out all day  The rooftop swimming pool is not as big as I imagined from the pictures online but is more than adequate for a quick cool off dip  We found this hotels location quite good  especially if you dont mind walking  It isnt in the middle of the busy district but is in easy distance of shops and eateries  There is a free shuttle bus available but we didnt get to use it during our stay  Unfortunately no one told us about the internet being available for free in the lobby until I say people using their laptops and asked at reception  which is when they told me  It would have been nice to have this information in the room  We booked the Big Bus Tour through the Tour Desk at the hotel and were very happy with the tour  however both the River Cruise on the Dhow and the Sand Dune Safari which we organised through the concierge were not as good or well organised  We did ask them to book the Sand Dune Safari advertised on one of the brochures we got at the hotel but found out when picked up it was not the same tour group  And when checking out other peoples photos of their Sand Dune Safari tours we felt that the tour we had been booked on was not as professional as the others  although a good time was had by all Dont miss out on the Sky Dubai  We went by taxi to the Emirates Mall and went to the Sky Dubai and spent a couple of hours there  We had a blast  
N =>  Excellent hotel  We stayed at Four Points by Sheraton between   th and   st ch  We had an early flight and arrived around  am  Our room was ready and what a great room it was  We expected a value accommodation and were surprised by the size of the room  standard of house keeping and professional attitude of all employees  We chose this hotel as we wanted to be close to both Old Town and Jumeira   this was a good bet as each taxi ride was no longer than    mins     mins on average   We will use this hotel from now on for all our stop overs in Dubai  Keep up the good work  
N =>  Excellent Choice This hotel turned out to be a perfect choice for us and we booked on the recommendations from people on this site  We arrived early in the morning and were greated by friendly and efficient reception staff who invited us to use the facilities of the gym and pool area to freshen up and relax until our room was ready  For us the hotel was in an ideal position within walking distance of what turned out to be our favourite spot in Dubai   the wonderful creek and the souks and the museum  If we neeed to go to the beach area we used the hotel shuttle bus which was always punctual and taxis which were very inexpensive to get us further  The bedroom was large  spotlessly clean with a seating area and a good area to make tea and coffee  Very comfortable bedding and robes and slippers  We didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food but thoughly enjoyed the house red in the little bar area which I understand is being extended  The only downside of the whole experience was being persuaded at the hotel to book a personal guide to take us around Dubai as opposed to the Bus  turned out to be a very impatient guide  who we couldn t understand  who rushed us around the sites we wanted to spend time at to get us in a few of his friends stores in the hope that we would buy something  An expensive mistake so beware  Apart from this little incident which was soon forgotten we had a fantastic time  I would like to give a special thank you to Yvette on reception   what a lovely  helpful lady  
N =>   Very Good Hotel We stayed   nights to the Four Points and everything was excellent We Checked in very early in the morning due to our flight from London and by the time we had breakfast our room was ready The hotel is absolutely spotless the food is very good There were no problems at all to get a taxi If you want to be by the beach this may not be the perfect hotel you are about   mns away by taxi Otherwise very good in general    
N =>  Not the best location We stayed here for   nights as part of our   night honeymoon in Dubai  I booked it because it was new and I love the feeling of new modern hotels  We had no problems checking in  As part of our  quot honeymooners welcome quot  they gave us a   cans of lemonade  Too funny   We didn t really expect anything  just in comparison to all the chocolates  cakes  flowers we had received in other hotels at other various destinations it was hilarious Location wise I really disliked it  It is not walking distance to much at all  We had to catch a taxi everywhere as soon as we stepped out of the hotel  I personally enjoy exploring places by foot  Luckily we had booked another hotel for the other   nights in Dubai  
N =>  Good hotel We ve stayed here for   nights in il The rooms were big enough  complimentary water and coffee was provided  The lobby bar was really small and all smoking  For breakfast they ll have the usual buffet style treats  Nothing big to complain about but one time the driver from the shuttle service to the Jumeirah Beach park refused to pick us up on the way back  We were stranded and had to wait    minutes for a cab All in all a nice hotel close to Bur Jurman shopping mall 
N =>   Not good I was there for a night on the way out and the hotel had just opened I think  The room was OK  but no internet  it took them an hour to bring me a bucket of ice  The staff was willing to help but did not know how  Looks like they have changed for the better  
N =>  Excellent but   I stayed for five days in y in this hotel  and overall it was excellent  My only take was that internet access was not free in the rooms  the charge per use was really prohibitive   But the hotel had the good sense of providing free wireless internet down in the lobby  
N =>   Enjoyed our Stay We stayed at Four Points Sheraton Downtown Dubai for   nights on a stopover on our way to Europe  We travelled with our   year old toddler and the staff went out of their way to help us  Our room was spacious  and we were happy they provided complimentary bottles of water We found the location ok  and we utilised the hotel car service  which wasn t over priced  to take us to the Gold Souk one morning  Taxis were easy to get  and are relatively inexpensive in Dubai As we were with our young son  we didn t venture out in the evening in Dubai but ate at the hotel restaurant on both nights  The buffet was good value and offered a good selection We will definitely stay again and we already recommended the hotel to a relative who visited Dubai in e  who also enjoyed his stay at the hotel  
Nice and New  Stayed one night in the Four Points downtown in mid uary  The hotel is brand new  The rooms are very modern and the service was great  As the other reviewer said  you need to make sure the taxi driver is aware of this hotel vs the other Four Points in Bur Dubai  I will stay here on my next visit to Dubai  
N =>   Four Points gepflegt und neu  
N =>   Beauty and the beast   Arrived earlier then the usual check in time  around   am  as my flight was early BUT was not allowed to check in early unless I payed a fee  VERY DISSAPPOINTING   The room was obviously available  After having a long flight with a young child you dont want to be in that situation where you are put on the spot   a bit sad if you have to pay all that money for just a few hours especially since we were staying for nearly   weeks I have stayed at many hotels and have never had a problem with early check in s  This hotel really needs to look into that cos there will be many customers they will lose if this keeps happening even though everything else in the hotel was perfect from the room to the roof top pool    I loved it all   P S  I would NOT recommend this hotel to a friend if they have a child and an early flight   
N =>   IMMACULATE   We have just returned after spending   nights at the four points We were given a preferred room on floor    it was very spacious and spotless The whole hotel just feels brand new We are looking to return to Dubai and would have no hesitation in going back or recommending the four points to anyone The staff were all very friendly and polite nothing was any trouble the views are great from the rooftop and is a great place to relax in the evening Fantastic value for money   
N =>   Clean good accomodation in good location Clean  good accommodation with pleasant design  Not exactly near anything but well located to get everywhere in Dubai  Rooftop pool good earlier in the day  when sun hits it  although not big   towels provided  Open air hot tub was nice  Small fitness centre  Acoupld of restaurants in the hotel although we always ate out  Taxis always readily available  
N =>   Great For Families Amazing Value We are a family of   and stayed in a   bdrm apartment  It was very spacious  with a separate kitchen   though a negative with his was that there was no utensils or crockery so could not be utilised     toilets    bathrooms  open plan living dining  laundry and   flat screen TV s  It was spotlessy clean  It had a lovely roof top pool with     deg views of the area  It is in a great location if you want to shop at Dubai Mall or catch the train to the beach The only main negative was that the hotel did not have a concierge  and to find out information was almost impossible  Also the apartment was not serviced for the   days we were there This was why I gave the service a low rating  
N =>   A hotel with positive  A hotel with positive  amp  negative points Positive points  good location kind  amp  polite staff good breakfast housekeeping give you a very good service they bring you everything you need rapidly they let passenger check out late even  h late than check out time without any charge  hotel s manager is very careful he read reviews  amp  he try to correct the negative points I wrote my review about smoking  amp  non smoking room I had a problem last year  but at this time we have a non smoking room that we would like Negative points king s room are very smaller than twin rooms  amp  there isn t no seat  amp  no table in king s room for taking foods or drinks My husband  amp  I we sat down on the bed   only there is make up table  amp  seat  the first day when I took a shower  amp  I wanted wipe myself I saw big spots of women make up on the towel there were three big towels in the bath room that two of them had women make up spots one of them was black  amp  you could even see the trace of both hands of that woman  amp  other was red I called housekeeping  amp  they changed all of towels big medium smallThey washed the towels but it rested the spots I think perhaps it became shabby but it was not good to use it for other passenger The sheets were shabby the first night my husband pull it on himself but it became torn The rooms by Sheikh Zayed road are noisy  we were on   th floor but we heard noises The cups are clean but I don t you why they smelt coffee when we washed them there isn t smelt coffee I think the system of washing in this hotel is not good I don t recommend this hotel only because of cleanliness  
N =>   Reception Problems   Nice hotel Positives  Spacious Rooms  Nice breakfast  descent prices  nice service at the restaurants Negatives  Bad service at the reception  I am an SPG Gold Member  I booked and payed for a non smoking preferred room  When checked in I was told that since I am a Gold Member I was  quot upgraded quot  to a preferred room  I told them that I was paying for such a room so do not tell me that you upgrade me      They did not say or do anything after that to fix their false statement  When entered the room  I realized from the smell that this was a smoking room  I called the reception and told them about this problem and their answer was that the preferred rooms were all full and in the next days if there was availability they would change us  However  when i searched through SPG COM    minutes later  I found out that there were more than   available non smoking preferred rooms  I went immediately to the reception and told them that  Their response was  quot The rooms were just been freed out quot       I had to search the internet to find out about their lie in order to change us room into a non smoking  This behavior is unacceptable  
N =>   Bad Service I was really disappointed with the service I got from the staff and management of the hotel  The first day we came to the hotel  we expected the staffs to help us with valet parking or to pick up our luggage  but instead they just stood around and ignored us  until we approached them  The price of the hotel is not worth the stay  You can stay at a better hotel on the same street for a cheaper price and quality service  The staffs are very rude in this hotel  Every night the security would stop us form entering the hotel elevator  because they thought we were outsiders  Did I mention the fact  every time you request a room service favor  the receptionist will call to follow up  it gets really annoying after a while  In addition  the hotel did a pre authorization on my credit card  however after I left  I discovered they charged the pre authorization on my credit card account  The staffs in the front desk tend to confuse you with piles of receipts and they are very unorganized  They need to update their technology and match up to the hospitality industry of the western society  One more thing  we did not know that our room included free parking  I asked the staff on the front desk several times   quot What does the price of our room include  quot  and not once have they mentioned parking they should tell all their customers about the services offered within the price of their room package  Very  very poor incompetent service  Please change management or get someone from North America to teach you how to run a hotel  PS  The staffs speak English  however it is really hard to understand their English  because of the accents  I suggest they hire a native English speaking staff to avoid the frustration of language barriers for customers like myself  
N =>  Always service with a Smile Me and my family stayed here for   nights    adults   baby and   teen   overall everything was good  we were in a twin room which was exceptoinally large  the staff were always friendly and polite  even with all my trouble   the manager on during my stay was the lady  im unsure of the name spelling  and even though there were some issues  she always managed to sort things out for me and seemed genuinely annoyed when she found out we were being overcharged when getting a taxi back from the mall  Walter was wonderful as others have said  thats not to say the others are not nice  but Walter was a bit more chatty  the only reason I have not given a full    was due to the location  although there are shops within walking distance  I think I may have been better off at a beach hotel as the area is not the best with kids in tow  plus when I was reseaching into this hotel a few of the booking sites mention thats its close to the mall  and i suppose it is  but with the way Dubai roads are there is no way of walking  maybe once the train is finished you might be able to use the walkway to get to the other side of the road and then maybe it will be within walking distance We never had breakfast there so cant comment  but the lunch buffet was nice  again not really a buffet as the only  quot have as much as you like quot  section was the starters and drinks  but it was all very nice  Hubby was delighted with the free Wi fi in the public areas  and wish other hotels would adopt this  
N =>   decent hotel but     when we arrived at hotel check in was quite simple and straight forword  we had been given an upgrade to a preferred room which was a nice touch  The room was nice and spacious with   leather bucket seats aswell as dressing area  The mini bar was stocked however we chose not to use anything as the prices where really high  The bathroom was also spacious and had a full size bath asn shower  The cleaners came daily however the times varied alot for example being british we did like our afternoon nap but some days the cleaner didn t appear until     pm so we couldn t rest on those days  There was a volleyball tournament going on in Dubai and a olot of teams where staying here which was a pain at breakfast as the hotel decided to  quot reserve quot  a section on the dining area for them which I think was unfair after all we we re paying guests to  Couldn t fault the breakfast here always fresh and kept stocked up the only downside was that waiting on staff didn t always refresh the table with full cutelry so some some days things where missing The rooftop pool was good apart from during our stay it was windy which made sunbathing difficult  can t stop the weather tho   The pool bar was also quite pricey Charlies bar had an happy hour  pm    pm which offered some drinks   for   Never ate at night here so can t comment  We walked up to Crowne Plaza as they had an offer on that offered the days Temp as discount off your meal so worth it in the steakhouse there  
N =>   I could live in this hotel     Amazing from start to finish  This hotel has the friendliest staff I have ever met  We were offered an upgrade and our room was massive  Facilities at the hotel are brilliant and the rooftop pool is the most amazing place to sunbathe  Location is excellent and taxis are easy to get to anywhere  We walked to the beach and it took around    mins  mainly due to the heat   Breakfast was nice and Charlie s bar is a nice place to have a drink and watch some sport  Having already been to Dubai before  this hotel made our  nd visit even more enjoyable  We will be back  
Nice Hotel Very nice   star hotel  conveniently located for Dubai Mall and burj tower as well as for business district  Also close to mena bazaar  However over half an hour drive from Jumeirah beach area  Good value hotel with some nice places to eat within walking distance  Nice roof top swimming pool and bar  
N =>   Excellent place to stay between attraction but not alot to do at night around the hotel Would recommend this hotel to anyone just using it as a base  Excellent size rooms   I stayed with my sister in law and room size was brilliant    two double beds  Exceptionally clean  good service   room service and housekeeping  Buffet restaurant was a bit chaotic on the day we tried to eat there tho  Hotel staff very helpful with directions etc but not a lot of info on where to go and what to do   but we had done that prior to arriving so not a problem Would def recommend a trip to the    Burj Al Arab for aft tea whilst in Dubai   DO NOT eat before going tho  
N =>   Absolutely fantastic we    friends  stayed at this hotel between   tth     th il    and I was Absolutely fantastic  our room was   bedroom suite   it was a large suite  it was about     sq m  The hotel and room was clean  the staff were very friendly and after   day we was good friends  The decors where good and the bathroom was really excellent  The Hotel location is in very good place in city   near jumeira and far from any traffic   There are eateries around like McDonalds  amp  KFC restaurants near by  we have a very beautiful Balcony in    floor by nice view of Sheikh zayed Road   but threre is not any noise in room when windows are close Overall it was a good experience  good location and absolutely i will com back again and i advise this hotel to all of my friends that come to dubai  
N =>   DO NOT STAY HERE    AWFUL EXPERIENCE  We checked into the Sheraton on the way back from Thailand and it almost ruined our whole holiday  Upon arriving we were told that we would have to pay half the room cost to check in early  after a long overnight flight with no sleep we desperatly needed to sleep so eventually after they stood their ground we had to pay the charge  On getting to the room we found a dirty room that had a blocked toilet  we moved room and found the same problem  the rooms are not clean  We also asked for a view of Sheikh Zayed road and were told to have that we would have to move to a smoking room  we didnt want this so had to have a view of a petrol station  Soon after coming to terms with the room I receieved news that i would need to travel back to the UK asap due to a personal family emergency  so i went to reception and asked if we could check out and not have to pay for the three days that we signed up for  this was about an hour after checking in  and remember we had already paid an early check in charge  which we were happy for them to keep  we were told that they would be happy to do this but out travel agent would charge us for one night  we called the travel agent and they advised us that they were happy to refund the full amount but the Sheraton are the ones who have demanded a one night fee  we went back to reception and told them this and after arguing with them for about an hour they told me to speak to the reservations supervisor  this guy must be one of the rudest people that i have ever come across  when i asked him  dont you care about your customers personal circumstances   he replied  no  so i said  money is the most important thing to you then   to which he stayed silent At this point i was very very unhappy and asked to speak to the general manager  when reception called his secatery  from what i could make out the receptionist was being given a list of names that we have to speak to before the GM  after putting the phone down we were told his not in his office  which was a lie After speaking to    different people over about   hours the  director of guest relations  came down  this was not the direcotr of guest relations and the name we were told was differeent to what was on his name tag  he said about three words to us and had the same attitude as the rest of them  at this stage i wa son the verge of snapping so i decided as i did not want to get locked up lol i paid the charges and checked out  On top of this i was making phone calls from the hotel to arrange a flight back  the calls were all to toll free numbers and i was advised by the hotel and the travel companies that they were free  then i found out that i was charged    per hour for the calls  i called the travel company and advised them of this and they said they DO NOT charge the hotel for the calls so they should not be charging me  i told the hotel this and guess what  they still charged me  i was also charged     for using th einternet for about    minutes  Makes you think money must be really important to these guys Also if you are arab or have the arab dress you will get much better service  and this blatantly obvious from what i seen I have recieved bad service before but nothing on the level of this  i have never had to write a letter of complaint as i am a very patient guy but this is the first time that i have had to conatct the head office of an organisation No regard or respect for the customer at all  
N =>   PLEASURABLE I stayed at this hotel between  tth     th il    and I could only say it was a pleasurable experience  The hotel was clean  the staff were nice and the breakfast was heaven sent  The room was good but not enough space between the bed and the tv cabinet  The decors where good and the bathroom was really excellent  The location was good however  I could not use my mobile phone in room because of lack of network connection  Each time i needed to make a call I had to go down to the lobby  The location was excellent as I could get to Gold souk and mall of the Emirates within  o mins  There are eateries around like McDonalds  starbuks  burger king and other restaurants near by  There is a train station under construction by the mani entrance but you will hardly notice or hear any sound  Overall it was a good experience  good location but expensive  
N =>   Excellent City Hotel to see Dubai We stayed here over Easter       Staff very friendly couldn t be more helpful On our last evening we were able to organise a party meal for some friends on the   th floor pool bar terrace   excellent food service and view Room excellent and well placed hotel to be recommended 
N =>   Great but red by Last Day of Poor Service This hotel is somewhat new and well located  Taxis are eays to come by and especially in the piercing heat  you don t want to stay under the sun for long  The front desk was extremely nice  They upgraded my family to a suite and allowed us a late checkout because of our night flight  Thank you Charly We were impressed with the suite  Everything was wonderful and we enjoyed staying the room On our last day  we asked for a cab  The concierge directed us to a non taxi  Given earlier reviews where warnings were given about being fleeced by these so called no meter taxis  I asked the concierge whether this taxi had a meter  He said  quot Yes quot   I then aske dhim how much the fare should be  He replied  quot    to    dirhams quot   When he ushered into the taxi  we asked again whether there s a meter  and the concierge pointed to a box and said it s in there  When we got to our destination  the driver wanted to charge us    dhs   My husband flipped and threatened to report the concierge to the hotel mgmt for being in cahoots with the unlicensed taxi driver in this scam  The driver buckled  Word must have gotten round to the concierge because when we checked out  none of them helped us with our luggage nor hailed a cab for us  It s sad that our beuatiful stay was marred by this incident  Although we didn t report to the hotel mgmt of this incident  perhaps they should look into this  It spoils the image of the hotel  
N =>  We love to stay here because it has huge rooms  The service was very good  The bedrooms were huge  specially bathrooms  We had three way balcony  We got two plasma tvs in two bedrooms and one in living room  We got eight sitter dinning table  One room with the washer  amp  dryer  We also got a big kitchen with huge cabinets  refrigerator  microwave  coffee maker and a four sitter dining table  We were in the middle of the Dubai  Sheikh Zayed Road   So it s more convenient to go anywhere  
N =>   GREAT VIEWS AND GREAT SERVICE  WOULD STAY AGAIN   This hotel and all the staff was great  We were upgraded to a   bedroom suite upon arrival  The staff were exremely friendly and helpful  After a long day out in the sun  you actually looked forward to going back to the hotel  I cant wait to return to the hotel for future stays   
N =>  Very happy from check in to check out  We were very happy with Four Points Sheikh Zayed Road for our stay during Ramadan with the comfort of a   bedroom executive apartment  laundry  kitchen  amp  the comfort that this provided us as well as being two steps from two different grocery store to choose from with an excellent variety of food  amp  drinks ARRIVING  amp  DEPARTINGOn arrival to DXB airport we took a pink Lady Taxi to the hotel it was a good price and ten minutes drive  On arriving to the hotel we had for hotel staffs come to tend to us and take our belongings inside  very professional  amp  efficient  When we checked out of this hotel we moved to the Sheraton Jumeirah Beach and used the hotel car service that was only   D more than a taxi but it was convenient  On arrival to the Sheraton Jumeirah Beach hotel the driver demanded a tip from us which took us most by surprise as it was not so friendly  RECEPTION RESERVATIONReception staffs were courteous and organised  We had facilities of the hotel explained to us  ideas of things we could see  amp  confirmation of our booking that was in order as we had booked on the hotel website direct  We were shown to our room on one of the top floors and shown through our apartment  Throughout our stay whenever we needed to approach the reception desk for information all our needs were met  amp  lovely to see employees take an interest in the guests  amp  very family friendly APARTMENTThe   bedroom executive is so spacious and modern our first impressions were WOW  The photos were exactly as the website however the fridge was larger than the photo  There are tiles through the entrance way has the tea coffee table  to the right was the dining table and open lounge area with a balcony to go out on    plus storeys up  To the left from the entrance was the guest bathroom then the bedroom with second bathroom  to the full kitchen  all goods supplied for guests staying    days or more  just basics were available to use as we were there less than    days   There was a cupboard that behind it stored the washing machine  amp  dryer  The amenities in the bathrooms were soap  shampoo  conditioner and body was of Green Tea  We prefer a shower to the style shower over bath however that is preference and the bathroom was very modern  The staff offered extra towels as items as we were travelling as a family and all were forward thinking to the needs we may have  That was very impressive  There were two TVs one in the bedroom and one in the lounge room with full selection of satellite channels in many languages  Arabic  English  German  French  and Italian to name a few  We were very happy with this choice to pay the small difference in price for a   bedroom apartment to have the extra room and comfort  FACILITIESThe roof top pool is a wonderful feature of this hotel  What a lovely place to have a swim with views of surrounding Dubai  There were change rooms and towels up on the top floor  Likewise the hotel gym was located up the top with a wonderful view  We dined at one of the hotel restaurants  The Eatery  where we enjoyed a very nice meal  It was opened during Ramadan with a large curtain that closed off the restaurant to the lobby area  There was free wifi for internet in the lobby area only  the few chairs provided were popular with many travellers aiming to use it as in the rooms as at a charge  We asked the concierge advice and questions to further plan our time during our stay in Dubai but were disappointed with the knowledge with the answers provided to establish where the nearest post office was to options for tours for example  There was no brochure display so perhaps something the hotel may supply for the future AREASheikh Zayed Road is the financial district of Dubai  In the immediate area of the hotel are a few restaurants  takeaway food like KFC  amp  Nandos as well as two supermarkets  all in walking distance of a few minutes  Shopping malls and the beach area short taxi ride away and there are some good tours that cover the city  We had a private tour with a driver picking us up and drop off at the hotel in a  WD giving us half a day tour which we found comfortable  amp  convenient as a family  This hotel was located in what was a very safe area to our impressions  
New Year in Dubai Me and my husband thought it would be nice get away from the grey skies of england and spend new year in DUBAI  The staff are very friendly  But the things to watch out for are    food is very limited in the hotel   but it is in a fab location in that other places to eat are in walking distance  and alot of the sights are a short taxi journey away only other issue is the cleaners    they dnt really do much by way of cleaning during your stay and often our room was not cleaned before  pmi thought the hotel rates were very high for this particular hotel but they may have been high because it was new year also before you decide to go to dubai i would like to warn you about the MASS CONSTRUCTION   you may find yourself walking down a perfectly lovely footpath and the next thing you know the footpath just dissappears and your in the middle of a construction site  i have been told that this constrcution is going to go on until at least       also things like crossing a road can be impossible as there are no overhead walking bridges or subways    so my advice get a taxi to wherever it is you need to go    
Nice Place Great staff i stayed at Sheraton sheikh zayed for   nights this month when mum came to visit me   the rooms are warmly decorated  the Beds are Extremly Big and comfi  and Best thing is THE STAFF they are all well trained and very nice n friendlyi had breakfast there almost everyday and it is more like a   stars breakfast very good variety    my sis is coming to dubai next weekend and already booked us a room there   cant wait to be back PS  book a room to Jumeirah side  sheikh zayed side is great view but tend to be a bit noisy  jumeirah side is an amazing view as well 
N =>   Questions about this hotel I will be at this hotel tomorrow  what the earliest  i can check in  is there airport shuttle bus  if not how much will a taxi cost me to get to the hotel  answer will be nice 
N =>   Pleasantly surprised Stayed at this property with husband and two kids aged    and    for   nights in ust  I was a bit skeptical before our trip as there were only   reviews available but was pleasantly surprised  We had booked two interconnected rooms  I confirmed this before our trip via email  Good thing that I had a print out because during check in they were giving us two rooms on separate floors  As soon as I produced the e mail they found two adjoining rooms and checked us in right away  They do not have connected rooms only adjoining ones  As the previous reviewers have stated the lobby is indeed very small with hardly any room to lounge  The location of the hotel more than made up for it  very convenient and taxis are easily available round the clock Our one room had a king bed and the other had two very large twins  The king room was much smaller than the twin room  The twin room was quite spacious although the bathroom was small  Both rooms had a walk out balcony overlooking Sheikh Zayed Road  Even though the weather was HOT we spent quite sometime standing there enjoying the views particularly at night  Both rooms were clean and comfortable  Two bottles of water were provided everyday free of charge  They also have a program where they give you one free  snack  from a list once during your stay  We got chicken sandwiches  muffin and fruit plate  A very nice touch Once ate lunch buffet at their restaurant downstairs  Plenty of items to choose but the food were at best average except for the  lamb  dish which was amazing Not to be missed is the rooftop pool area for the     degree views  Weather did not permit us to stay much long and lounge around  Will I stay here again  Most probably  unless I want to be close to the beach in a more resort like setting  
N =>  Eatery Buffet Ate at the Eatery  The food selection was very small for the hot food  There was only one fish option  The starters were ok  The dessert bar was OK  there was however no icecream  The Buffet cost    dirhams  but the drinks were not inclusive  so we had to pay for the drinks seperately  Some of the hotel staff were not very knowledgeable on what the    dirhams included  because before hand I called to make reservations  and was told that drinks such as coke and sprite were included in the    dirham Not sure if i will be going back there anytime soon  
Nice Business Hotel The rooms are nice and the staff was rather helpful The only minus I could think of was the shower in the bathrooms which had very low water pressure  
N =>   Visitors beware  Ridiculous luggage policy My wife and I just returned from our honeymoon in Dubai  staying at the FP Sheikh Zayed Road  Rooms were good  clean  but without free wireless internet  and staff  in particular coffee shop staff and chefs were amongst the most helpful and efficient going around  The breakfast was very good in offering an excellent range and quality of dishes   a real highlight Unfortunately  upon checking out  and with    mins before being picked up for our pre arranged tour of the city  we were first told by the concierge  quot we don t have any room to store your bags for a few hours quot      and then by reception  quot Two weeks ago  the local police has issued a directive forbidding our hotel to keep luggage after a guest has checked out   you must take it with you quot        A quick call to   competing hotels in the area during our discussion revealed no such policy in practice elsewhere Escalating our complaint to the disinterested duty manager only produced  in a most dismissive tone  quot Well  you can take the luggage to the airport and check them in quot   We were shocked   a major inconvenience and policy complication affecting all guests  and the management hadn t even thought of alerting guests to the policy change  nor to formulating useful suggestions to offer to guests aggreived by this policy Our tour bus arrived  and we were forced to pay an additional half day room rate  just to store our bags     Thanks for souring what was otherwise a pleasant honeymoon experience in Dubai FP Sheikh Zayed Road

N => Clean spacious and cheap for Dubai   but avoid the hotel car We stayed at Golden Sands    make sure you know which Golden Sands you are in as there are like    different Golden Sands Hotel in the area   From the research we did  we found that this was the cheapest hotel we could find in the expensive city of Dubai  We paid about      USD for a   bedroom   bathroom  It was quite spacious   there was a kitchen  complete with W D  area and a living room area with sofas and a dining table  There were   single beds in the corner by one bathroom and then there was a seperate bedroom with a double bed that also had its own bathroom  So technically  there was only   true bedroom and the other   beds were more like in the open area  no door separating this area from the living room kitchen  Postives  it was clean  spacious  came with a free bottle of water  we were informed not to drink the tap water   and also had free internet in the lobby Negatives  mattress was pretty hard  We also had a negative experience with the hotel car  We went to check out and stepped outside to hail a cab to the airport and the hotel car driver came running up to us and assured us that he was using the meter and quoted us a reasonable price to the airport  which we agreed to  As soon as we got in  we noticed that the base fare for the meter was a bit higher than what we had seen in normal city taxis  When we arrived at the airport  the driver asked for more money than we had originally agreed to because he said he had to pay tolls  regular taxis are exempt from tolls  but he stated that as he was the hotel car  he was not exempt   We informed him that he did not mention tolls when we were agreeing on a price and we sat there for about   minutes arguing an he finally agreed to just let us pay what was on the meter  I m fairly sure that it still would have been cheaper if we just would have taken a normal city taxi  so we would recommend AVOIDING the hotel car  no matter how persistent they are  
N =>  Great vlue for money We stayed at the GS   The room was great  with a fridge freezer and hot plate  no oven  It was cleaned every day to a good standard  It is in the city area so a good distances from the beach area but we knew that before we went  Taxis are quite cheap so not to bad  
N =>   Nice room miserable welcome     We stayed at Golden Sands   for   nights and it was okay   nothing more and nothing less  The room was okay   a studio with quite nice furniture  twin beds  kitchenette  etc  The advert said the room could accommodate up to three but they clearly did not encourage this as despite the fact we told them there would be three of us when we booked  there was no bed linen in the room to make up the sofa bed and there was only two of everything else such as towels  crockery  cutlery  etc  which was a bit odd  We requested extra bed linen for the sofa bed and the housekeeper promptly brought some to us including extra towels  However  when the room was made up the next day the third towel disappeared again   The furnishings in the room were quite nice although the mattress on the sofa bed had some revolting looking stains on it so in the end my son slept on it closed Staff wise  the receptionists were rather odd   far from welcoming  My biggest dislike was most times when I went to the counter I virtually always had to ask for service  despite the fact that the receptionists saw me waiting right in front of them  In fact  one morning I said  good morning  cheerily to the guy on reception and he did not even acknowledge me until I repeated it in a more aggressive tone  The staff in the breakfast room were a bit more pleasant  but top marks go to the back of house staff such as the housekeepers who were always really courteous and greeted is with big smiles The breakfast was included in our room rate  but again only for two of us so we had to pay for my nine year old son  The food was mediocre but plentiful enough although to be honest I would have preferred to not have had the breakfast in the room rate and made do with the kitchenette in the room to rustle something up instead The complex has two swimming pools   both small but enough to keep kids and some adults amused for a while  There was also a gym and sauna although we never got to use them  The breakfast room was located in the coffee shop which did food throughout the day although we did not try it For internet  we had to borrow a cable from the reception to use our computer in the room although it didn t seem to work and according to the instructions they provided it would not have been particularly fast anyway  They also had free wifi in the coffee shop and whilst we never used it  several other people were on it regularly so presumably it was okay Our room rate gave us a late checkout of  pm  The night before  reception has left us a note saying we had to be out before that but when it was queried with them they agreed it was a mistake and checkout was indeed  pm  That was very useful as our flight was not until quite late in the evening and it meant we could rest a bit in the afternoon before travelling  Baggage can be left at the hotel once you have checked out but it is just left out in the lobby by the toilets and they ask you to sign a responsibility waiver so I would not recommend leaving any valuables in your luggage  Saying that  we had no problems The hotel location is okay   a    minute walk from Bur Juman and it s new metro station and there s loads of restaurants in the surrounding hotels too  There s always loads of taxis passing by so they are easy enough to flag down  although coming back was sometimes difficult as some taxi drivers never knew exactly where the complex was   quite understandable given that there are many in the Golden Sands chain  In fact  make sure you get dropped at the right one as some of the others are quite a walk away and the whole area looks identical no matter which street you are on All in all our stay at Golden Sands   was okay  but to be honest I think there are better apartment complexes around the same areas for similar money  My biggest issue with the place was with the reception staff  many of whom could do with a bit of customer service training or better still  laughing gas   
N =>   Dissapointed It was cramped  dirty  smelly and musty  Not really a place I d go again to  Helpful staff  a pool and a small cafe in it gave it a poor insted of a terrible  
N =>   Good priced place to stay Clean spacious apartments  easy reach of the Bur Juman Mall and local supermarket  
N =>   You get what you pay for it was OK    We arrive at  am  they couldn t put us in a room but they could take our bags  The staff never smile  never say thank you or good morning  they re like robots  I ve traveled to Dubai   times and find this pretty normal with most folk here  so I always do my utmost to be ever so pleasant  We were told to wait until   am  so we went for a walk  now   deg c outside   too hot  came back  Sat in the lobby until  pm  Then we were told where to go and bags were bought up to the room Room was ok  VERY hard bed  Harder than you will be used to  trust me  I like a hard bed  but this was like a block of wood Free water was nice  Bathroom leaked  drip drip drip  and the walls are not so much   It s handy enough for shopping malls etc  But don t expect ANYTHING more than what you pay for  No niceties  no  quot can I help you  quot  and as always  my wife was ignored and I had to do all the talking  male dominant female subservient thing  Overall  it s good value guess  but we did stay in a better one on the way back  
N =>   Good Location Good place to stay although hotel is looking a bit tired  staff extremley polite and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed We had a suite which was great as I could do some washing  after purchasing washing powder from supermarket There are no hairdryers in the rooms so we had to loan one from the hotel  The airconditioner in the master bedroom sounded like a truck so we had to turn it off  fortunately the one in the lounge was sufficient to cool the whole suite down  Bathroom looked very run down and a bit sad  looked like the rooms had been renovated but not the bathroom but was sufficient for a shower etc The restaraunt staff were great  extremely obliging  The tour desk was amazing and very helpful although very shy so I can see how some people would think they are rude  but we found the opposite Taxis are always available and the taxi drivers know where this hotel is  good idea to get a basic price first as twice they tried to scam us  I think price wise this hotel is competitive  
N =>   Do be ripped off I stayed at this Hotel in ember      and had been a regular customer over the last couple years   When I returned home after my trip I notice an overcharge on my credit card which I didn t incur while at the hotel I connected the hotel who admitted the mistake but I still have not got my money back  I left  I think that it is quite a good hotel but I would advise travellers to made sure that they not incur overcharging  Do not give them your credit card  I did advise the management several times about this matter and the fact that I would be posting this if I do not get satisfaction  
N =>   Not the best place to stay Downside You may get shifted to a diff  Golden sands   I was moved to GS   from Gs   The Tourist office sucks    not very helpfulThe fuse in my room tripped in the middle of the night The bathrooms are smelly View is horrible UpsideConvenient location Can exchange currency You can cook in the rooms with microwave and an ovenHas internet 
N => A Stay To Remember We a family of four stayed in Golden Sands Hotel Apt    from         for   nights Thanks to the Hotel Desk of Golden Sands at the Airport itself we were made aware of the Free Shuttle Service every   hours between the Airport  amp  the Hotel Being a first time traveller to Dubai the entry itself was a good experience to us  On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very friendly  amp  helpful The   Room Studio Apt  was neatly  amp  comfortably done The Gym  amp  the Swimming Pool though a small one was a good relaxation The Travel Desk at the hotel was a very convenient option for booking BIG BUS TICKETS  amp  DESERT SAFARI However we were unable to use the free shuttle to the Beach due to limited number of seats available   Buying a few things from the nearby Spinneys  amp  making breakfast in the room itself is a good idea Hotel is Ideally located behind Bur Juman Shopping Centre  Though our visit to Dubai was very short  it was indeed a stay to remember  
N =>   Not bad for price Arrived early Sat morning at      am  Although i had emailed hotel before to see if we could pay a bit extra for the room they still charged us for a full day  Not the best place to stop in Dubai however for the price you cant crumble  If on a budget a great choice but if you can afford a more expensive hotel then push the boat out   
N =>   excellent service    well worth the stay  its more convenient to travel to the hotel by cab  be sure to make a note to which hotel you re going  since there s about    golden sands apartment hotel within the area room is cleaned everyday including fresh sheets and towels if you plan to eat in your room  there s plenty of cooking utensils to use  there s even a washing machine if you intend to wash up your clothes before you go home wifi is available in the hotel cafe visiting the mall and other tourist spots are accessible by cab  there are some shops that are within walking range  
N =>   Great Affordable choice for Dubai We arrived on an early morning flight into Dubai  The Golden Sands airport shuttle goes from Terminal   and only every   hours  so we got a taxi      Dirhams     Dirhams just to sit in the taxi at the airport  Upon arrival we checked in and were asked to wait in the foyer until our room was ready  In reality you could probably leave your bags there and go out  but we were tired didn t think anything would be open at  am  so opted to wait  At     am we were able to get into our room  Since official check in time is   noon  I didn t think this was too bad  The studio appartment  Golden sands    was spacious and clean  We only stayed one night so didn t really use the extra facilities of the washing machine  microwave etc We walked to the Burjaman mall        mins  where they have a food court and also restaurants and then continued on to the creek and the Dubai museum  another       mins   Do able  but you have to like walking and not in the middle of the day We needed to leave our luggage for the day upon check out and I was concerned that it would just be left exposed in the lobby as it was on check in  The reception staff informed me that it would be locked away for the day  Whilst I did not see them take it away  upon return it did have to be retreived from behind reception by the porter The reception staff tried hard  but did not fill me with confidence  I get the impression they are trying to be better than a    hotel with the porters etc We took the evening shuttle back to the airport and were able to be droped off at Terminal   All in all  a good hotel for the price  There are some restaurants within walking distance and otherwise taxi s are cheap  Our most expensive was from Mall of the Emirates   about    Dirhams  It is great that they try to let you into the rooms early if they can and securely store your baggage for you upon departure  
N =>  Frustrating hospitality On our honeymoon  after   days in Bali  we flew to Dubai for   nights  Golden Sands was chosen as one of my friends had been there before and the hotel seemed to be a value for money destination  As people say    quot First impression is last impression quot   the trouble we faced right from landing at Dubai Airport and talking to Golden Sands personnel at their office in the Airport lounge till the time our room was allocated to us  was exasperating and created an extremely negative view about their service standards  Inspite of us having the booking confirmation from our agent  the hotel officials said there was no booking in our name  they claim there was some problem at the processing end  and hence they cannot do anything  Several calls  international calls from my cellphone  were made to my agent in India and I was constantly questioning the hotel management at the hotel reception for a reasonable answer for such mismanagement  If this was not enough  the reception staff was extremely arrogant to say the least  The manager of the hotel inspite of being aware about our situation went to sleep as his shift was getting over without bothering to solve our problem  After   hrs of ordeal  suddenly one of the staff came to us and said our room is allocated and upon asking how come suddenly the reservation showed up in their system  no convincing answer was made available  Bottomline   i dont think this was a one off case as later on i realised this was experienced by many other travellers and hence  stay away     better options exist in Dubai  
N =>  Excellent for families who don t need hand holding Stayed with my family    kids  for   nights  Clean rooms and friendly staff  worth mentioning that if you need something just ask and they ll help you out  i e  they gave us coat hangers  dish soap  and a dish sponge  Internet in lobby works fine  tour office  GS    was excellent  small market open    hrs   min walk away  taxi s always available  pool used by kids for a couple of hours while I used the gym  basic but adequate to do     of my workout  treadmills  bikes  flowmotion gym   have a shuttle to airport but only to from Terminal    all Emirates flights arrive T  now   Rooms were more than adequate  separate bedroom and two baths plus a kitchenette  microwave  stove  fridge and an electric hot water pot  not too many utensils but enough to make due   two baths with showers and bidets  sitting area with TV  sofas and coffee table  small table for eating  desk  balcony  air conditioning in both rooms Location is in Bur Dubai close to the old souk  Need to take taxi or bus to get around town  Safe area  need key to enter elevator lift  Be sure to ask via email which GS  golden sands  you are in as there are     although all in the same area  Didn t eat in restaurant but had two greek salads from room service which were good   room service    hrs  Price     euros a night  Absolutely fantastic  Would highly recommend this hotel to those who don t need a luxury room  
N =>   Great hotel for a short break or stopover Stayed at the Golden Sands   for a one night stopover on the way back from Australia to Manchester  Arrived  am along with lots of others     Dirhams taxi but they do a transfer bus so it s worth emailing   Check in was technically  pm but we were checked in and told we would have a room by   am  In fact it was      which was great  Room ideal     rooms    bathrooms  kitchen including washing machine and microwave  View of building site  but really clean and comfortable with air con  Not near beach but not a bad area  We walked to the old town and the creek and got a taxi to the Jumeirah Beach Gardens    Dirhams to get in    you can also get the bus to the beach from close to the hotel  Then back to the hotel rooftop pool   not fantastic but clean and great for our    year old to have a dip  For tea we found an Indian restaurant nearby and got a nice meal for    Dirham for   of us          Got the free hotel airport transfer at  am  Missed the included breakfast but still great value at     from ebookers  Make sure you email the hotel to find out which Golden Sands block you are in  there are      and they will also tell you the times of airport transfers  there are free transfers to the beach too   Golden Sands would be great for a short break in Dubai  
N =>   Great Apart hotel though Costly I stayed in this Hotel in ember        which is Peak season in Dubai  The Apart hotel was ideally located in the center of the city  There was a Spinney s Supermarket just across the street and transport was easily available which is essential in Dubai which does not have very good public transport The hotel was quite costly since it was peak season  But the rooms were very spacious  It was cleaned every day which was a pleasant surprise after our Europe visit where those guys clean every week only  The facilities in the apartment were also excellent   a huge well kept kitchen with a big fridge  microwave and all amenties  First time we saw an apartment with not only a washing machine but a clothes drying machine also  Another pleasant surprise was that the first day  due to horry  we had kept the dirty dishes for washing in the evening  When we returned the dishes had all been cleaned by the service people  Unbelievable  The hotel people were also very helpful in arranging tours etc  but we just took their advise and then arranged the tours ourselves as the cost otherwise is much higher  They also gave us good advise where to go  what all to see and what to do  If you dont enjoy car motion  I would suggest not to take the Desert Safari   You feel very queasy  The Atlantis Hotel Aquarium is very costly  Instead go to the Dubai mall  they have a huge aquarium  The Ibin Batuta Mall is very nice  But nothing much to do in Dubai really  Only for a     night visit  Thats all  
N =>   Good Apartments The rooms are neat and well maintained  More of a Business Service apartments Close to Malls and walking distance to eating places for Indian Food  
N =>  great stay we arrived on the  th april for  nights we where a group of       familys we had booked in november did request to be next to each other but when we got there   families where next to each other the other family was on the same floor but on the opposite side of the hotel which was a bit of a inconvience  after reading the reveiws on the hotel i was abit worryed   But when we got there i couldn t fault the hotel we stayed in golden sands   in the   bed studio apartments the kitchen was abit small as their where   of us in the room the   bathrooms wher very clean and tidy and the sheets and towels where changed everyday  we booked our trips and hired a minibus with a company called diamond tours the owners name was called Raju   he was great     reasonably in price and he had a minibus which meant that we travelled everywhere together which was good for us and cheaper    we where never bored there are lots of shops and malls around there within walking distance if your looking for a holiday where you just stay in the hotel and pool then i would nt recommend this hotel  
N =>   great stay We went with a group of us    in total  We arrived at     am but was dissapointed to be told we couldnt check in till   pm as there were no rooms available  We had reserved a   bed studio and   bed apartment  We then found out that the   bed studio was in a different building  golden sands    while the   bed is in golden sands    So we patiently waitied till   pm and then was told that actually tehy had over booked and was now offering us   single studios in the same building Golden sands    I was quite dissapointed with this service at first but it actually worked out fine in the end So generally after the check in problem the hotel saty was great had no other complaints  Our rooms were cleaned everyday and the staff was very freindly Great hotel if ur on a budget and location was good too  
N =>   Value for money We stayed at Golden Sands   The hotel was convenient  Reception desk need to be more informed They could not even give direction to the nearest Mosque  The tall buildings in the area made it difficult to find The bathroom definately need a upgrade  The towels need to be replaced Furthermore we enjoyed our stay  The food in restuarant good They need to install more lifts  the corridors to long to walk  Our room was comfortable  amp  for the price we paid  
N =>  Stay away if you can I arrived at the hotel and was immediatel shunned to golden sands    I was told that if i have the cab maybe I can use that to move  But I told them unfortunately I had let the cab leave  Anyways it wasnt very far so I could move there  I was given a smoking room eben though I had clearly asked for non smoking  Opening the room proved to be a challanged  The hotel key opening system is difficult to work with to say the least The room proved as great as my reception     Old furniture  Bedsheets which looked at least   decades old  stinky bathrooms  no alarm clocks  no electrical sockets  I had to unplug the tv to charge my laptop    I tried to goto the hotel travel centre to book a tour but the Arabic lady there was as lazy as I have seen them  No help at all  I called her later to book a tour but was told that I had to be there in person to do it and also had to be there in   mins which was the deadline  Calls outside dubai including to other emirates like sharjah and abudhabhi are charged  Internet is slow and a lot of regular sights are blocked by the govt  At      in the morning the fuse blew up so no power in the room  Finally the only person in the hotel who serves as bell boy  room service etc came to fix it It is a   star at the best  The only plus point was that there is a shuttle to the airport from the hotel which stops at all the other appartment hotels and takes around    mins to get to the airport  
N =>   great facilites We stayed here   nights stopover huge room cooker fridge washing machine all you would need Only problem was we had to wait   hour in lobby for room after flying from LHR arriving very tired NO booze in hotel or for sale at local supermarkets we walked to Majestic Hotel   minutes away to find bar very pricey    a pint Did a day trip tp Abu Dubai really worth it cost the same a taxi would and commentry was good many places to see city tour also good value Dubai is a huge building site they are building a train tram link from airport to centre   lanes of trafic both ways and VERY busy taxis cheap shooping malls just like any high street shops put in posher surroundings We would go back nice pool area in app  and roof terrace very quiet  maybe lack of drink helped  We found staff friendly if not somewhat shy just put it down to culture 
N =>  Excellent choice Stayed here for   nights up to  th ch  Very good location for getting around but we used Taxi s all the time as they are so cheap The meter does not work when taxi is not moving  Airport free shuttel available for this hotel  We stayed in Apartment Block   Could not find fault with this hote  Rooms were fantastic size with massive double bed and air conditioning and fitted kitchen Only fault of this trip was we were told you are allowed   etc  ltrs of booze enteriyng Dubai  you can not buy take outs in Dubai  which was fine We bought  ltrsr mostly up market brandy etc as presents  We had packed them in our big suitcases on return journey  but they were confiscated at the airport   
N =>  Great hotel and good value for money   th   th e  Golden Sand  Arrived Dubai very early in the morning  Despite the check in time being     hrs  reception staff allowed us to check in to the room as early as      and they didn t even charge anything extra for it which was a great gesture This was super value for the money we paid  Apartments were great as well  would be idea for longer stays  Enough space and well equipped for an apartment  easy access to most of the shopping malls as located in Bur Dubai  well known with all taxi drivers  was well impressed with the gym even though I didn t have a time to use it  Generally all staff are polite and very helpful  Definitely stay in this hotel when ever we go to DubaiSurinda   Wimbledon UK 
N =>   Review Goldens Sands    Our first visit to Dubai with our   teenagers for a   night stopover at Golden Sands             The apartment was spacious    bed   bath kitchen dining lounge laundry  a little dated but clean and serviced daily  Limited amount of utensils  amp  cooking equipment  a toaster had to be requested to loan Restaurant in lobby serving breakfast We didnt make use of the pool as we were out sightseeing each day  the pool area again looked dated and a bit shabby Easy access to Spinneys supermarket across the road  amp  Burjuman Mall   min walk otherwise surrounded by other apartment blocks  and note that dispite the name it is no where near the beach and you are reliant on taxis  which are very cheap  but the taxi drivers get confused as to where to find GS    just say opposite Spinneys     We had trouble accessing the internet  very slow  and the printer was not working to print our boarding passes  staff not over friendly or helpful On arrival they informed us of a     dirhum security deposit on top of price quoted not mentioned in the booking  we are still pursuing return of this deposit to our credit card  We would recomend GS   to families who want a short stopover and low cost accomodation  it was within our budget and suited us but if we went for longer would pay more for a resort nearer the beach    As a family we enjoyed Ski Dubai Mall of Emirates Desert Safari Wadi Wadi Water Park Dubai Mall Gold Souk Bur Dubai  Museum Jumeirah Beach Wish we had time to do more  Dubai is amazing  
N =>   ok if you re not fussy about customer service Our booking confirmation stated  quot Golden Sands   quot   When we arrived at about   a m  the check in clerk told us we ve been upgraded and we need to go to Golden Sands     which is NOT quite next door  which they have somewhat forgotten to inform us beforehand even though the booking  confirmation was done way back in y       Thank goodness we had family members in Dubai who picked us up from the airport  otherwise we would have to walk the distance at the ungodly hour in search of this GS    The apartment itself was quite nice   good size with comfy rooms  beds  well equipped  washing machine  dryer  kitchen utensils  crockery   house keeping that cleans the place up every day  good sized bathrooms etc  There s also quite a good supermarket and some caf s within walking distance but apart from that  you d need to take a taxi to anywhere else  Note  taxi fares are expensive in Dubai but we elected this hotel for its price  amp  the probability of family  friends in Dubai who could take us around in their cars I can go on and on to demonstrate the level of service or rather lack of it  but to cut the story short   don t expect that much of customer service and your stay would be quite pleasant  In fact  it s not just the hotel   customer service in Dubai leaves a lot to be desired  Be especially wary of agencies that conduct the  quot touristy quot  escapade  Our sand dune adventure with Atlanta Travels and Tours was  I believe  a real rip off  Except in those top notch hotels  eateries  I don t think they care two hoots about tourists  customer service  
N =>   Internet is limited   MS Outlook not compatible The Hotel is located in a great area near the Bur Juman Mall They offer Internet  Great Rooftop PoolI booked it for   days of BUSINESS intending to work out of the room with MS Outlook  email HOWEVER  after checking in  I spoke to the IT Department and they confirmed that I would NOT be able to use MS Outlook to send receive E Mails     my   days were spent in an Internet Cafe  instead of the clean compfrotable rooms at the Hotel For some reason  the IT Dept  said that their Server did NOT support SMTP I would NOT recommend this Hotel if you must have E Mail Access through MS Outlook 
N =>   OK Place to stay in Dubai I wasn t sure what to expect in Dubai  I have sent many people there for stopovers  amp  that s exactly what we were using it for  I m very open when it comes to Arabic people  had at that time no opinion of them however did find they are not the friendliest nor the most welcoming to their country  On entry through customs there was no conversation at all  not even a welcom to Dubai  just a motion of the hand and passport said  Then passports plonked back on the counter  amp  that was that  We had a private car transfer booked  amp  that worked fine on arrival  amp  I was very thankful I had done that as outside the airport is busy Our reception at the hotel was as friendly as it was at the customs  Now I m a friendly person  I don t look mean or like I m going to bite  amp  have good manners  amp  travelling with a teenager who is the same  I deal with the public everyday  amp  know the importance of a smile  amp  this  amp  a friendly hello costs nothing Our room was a great size  had a kitchenette  washing machine dryer which we were desperate for  the beds were comfy  amp  rooms quiet  Bathrooms were a good size however the shower taps were mixed up and hot was cold  amp  vice versa  amp  nearly caused my son to be burned The hotel wasn t far from the shopping centre  amp  prices in the supermarket nearby were really good  amp  I can happily say that we had a very friendly  efficient asian girl at the McDonalds who was very welcoming We did a city tour  amp  was picked up in a largish Tarago style vehicle    people including the driver  was very squishy as   were largish  amp  we were in  amp  out so much everyone got a bit frustrated  The city itself was fantastic  amp  I m glad I have seen it   amazing  We were taken all around  amp  saw alot driving along but what was disappointing was we were then taken to one shop after another which wasn t mentioned on the tour  The first one was the Islamic Arts Centre which was nice  really different things but very very expensive  amp  we were ushered along past people with calculators ready for us to buy things  amp  I mean these things were thousands of dollars  amp  none of us looked like we had that sort of money  We were then deposited at another place  amp  we just went in  amp  out  amp  everyone came out after us as it was exactly the same  We then went to the beach and outside the Burj Hotel  The city is so big we spent ages driving but it was interesting  We finished at the gold markets but again very expensive Travelling with a teenager on my own I would not have gone out at night  amp  have heard from clients that they wouldn t either  The city is full of men just wandering around at night  sitting on street corners  amp  barely a woman to be seen  I have honestly never seen so many people as around the bus station  amp  ferry terminal   very un nerving  We had room service for dinner  amp  that was nice  amp  the waiter was very nice  amp  friendly  We had only   nights there before heading to Egypt  We had organised a private transfer to take us to the airport  amp  the main purpose of this was convenience  amp  so we had time as I don t like rushing When we first arrived in to the hotel we had a message saying the car would pick us up the night before so I called  amp  confirmed the info was incorrect  amp  they confirmed their mistake  However I then received   different times dates but I confirmed again the day  amp  time  Anyway to cut a long story short  the driver never showed up so I spoke to the rep who was at the hotel  amp  she said it would be there in  mins then she left     mins later  amp  two irate phone calls a van with people in pulls up  amp  we fly to the airport in the nick of time  Not impressed with that so will be letting the wholesaler know as I would hate my clients to go through that stress Otherwise an ok place  No customer service on checkout  amp  to be honest I really got the impression they just didn t give a hoot about tourists  Will be recommending to my clients get in and get out  don t waste anymore time there as they obviously don t appreciate the business in that country  
N =>  Very average This hotel was very average for the price we paid  we went during the weekend of the International Rugby   s though  so I think it was more expensive than usual   The location was bad  as there was nowhere that we could go that was within walking distance   had to catch a cab for at least         minutes to go absolutely anywhere  including all meals as the hotel restaurant was not very nice  and to me  that s not what I want in a holiday  I imagine however that this could be the case with a lot of hotels in Dubai  but if possible  I would reccomend working out what what you actually want to do in Dubai and choose accommodation accordingly  I e  we were there for three days and went to the Burj Al Arab  Atlantis Aquaventure water park  Buddah Bar  highly reccomended  although very expensive    and the Mall of the Emirates during our stay   these all happened to be in  quot New Dubai quot  which is a good       minute cab ride from Golden Sands  so we would have been better off staying in that area instead  not sure if there is a difference in price however   We also had a problem with our air con  and even once it was fixed  it wasn t very cold   this wasn t too much of a problem  as we went during winter when it s not as hot  but in the warmer months it would have been horrible  All in all  I think my expectations of Dubai in general were a little high  and the very average hotel just topped this off  I suppose it was only when I got there that I realised that my idea of a holiday isn t spending all day in gigantic air conditioned shopping malls and being stuck in traffic   but if that s what you re into  then maybe you ll like it   
Not for business travel From the point of view of a business traveller    The Golden Sands is not up to scratch compared to other newer apartment hotels  I had a   bedroom apartment at Golden Sands   and it did not compare to any of the three other similar residences I have tried  The decor was old  the kitchenette miniature and inadequate  the curtains in the lounge and bedroom didn t close and the bathroom was shabby  Internet access was limited to the restaurant and taxis are a real pain to get hold of in the morning If this had been particularly cheap  then you could overlook some of these points  but it was      per night  whereas for      there are much much better places available  To mitigate this  it was the week of GITEX  which means that hotel places were few and rates high  I also can t comment on the larger family sized apartments I left after one night  despite being booked for six On the plus side  the staff were pleasant and efficient  
N =>   We can recommend it  We stayed    days in a studio apartment in Golden Sands    The studio apartment was quite big  very clean and we can recommend a stay in this apartment  The apartment was cleaned up every day and also our dishes were washed every day  The staff was friendly  The internet connection in the lobby was not so good  
N =>  No complaints We stayed at Golden Sands   for just one night as we had a one night stop over in Dubai on our way home from a   week holiday in Sri Lanka which had resulted from a change in our return flight  Golden Sands   was the accommodation given to us due to the flight change  The accommodation was very nice   there were   of us and we had an apartment with two single beds in the living area and an additional separate bedroom with a double bed  We also had   bathrooms which was great  The apartment was very clean and tidy with a fully equipped kitchen with complimentary bottled water  As we were only there one night we only made coffee in the kitchen and did not have time to make use of any of the other facilities on offer  When we arrived in Dubai we found that Golden Sands has its own desk at the airport  We asked about getting to Golden Sands and were told  by a miserable lady behind the desk   to get a taxi  We had heard that there was a free shuttle service but were too tired to go looking for it  Upon checking in to the hotel and enquiring about getting back to the airport the following morning we were advised that we could use the free shuttle service  We found the shuttle service very good with a very helpful driver who helped us with our bags at both ends and pointed us in the right direction at the airport for our airline check in desk   also we found he took a much quicker route to the airport than our taxi driver had taken the previous day which did make us think the taxi driver had taken a longer route to increase his fare  We would visit Dubai again for a longer visit  but when it is not so humid        on our trip   and would definitely consider staying at the Golden Sands again  
Nice Hotel I stayed   nights in golden sands    it is a nice hotel and correct choice  free internet  large room  gym  good location and good for family  i will stay there again 
N =>   Good value Stayed in a studio in Golden Sands   for   nights  Dubai isn t really the kind of place you go to on a budget so there are very few hotels that offer as good value as Golden Sands  Though you might not find the rooms are worth their   stars they re clean and the hotel staff and services are great  Didn t think much to the restaurant but room service was handy  they also run a free shuttle bus to the airport  though taxis aren t particularly expensive  
N =>  Below Average I booked this place as part of my honeymoon and I must say it was very poor condition  on the first night the shower was not working and then when they did come round to sorting it out we were into our  nd day and now the door lock start playng up  We did not left this put us down We loved dubai what a amazing place will be going back there very soon  The apartments are very poor standard compared to other places that we have seen here  my advice spend a little more and go that extra mile and avoid this place at all cost  
N =>   Fantastic Stay Stayed in a studio apartment  Golden Sands    for a week in e  It was fantastic  Expedia didnt tell me which apartment block it was  i didnt know there was more than     but the transfer driver knew anyway   Room was fab   clean  spacious  view wasnt spectacular   looked out over the carpark  but to be fair we didnt spend any time in the room Staff were all pleasant  some difficult to understand  but was ok We arrived at  am  but they wouldnt let us check in until     Annoying  They said leave our bags  but there wasnt a lock up room to put them in  it was just in the reception area  We left our bags there  and they were still there with everything in when we came back  So  if youre planning on staying at the GS  then try to arrive after   am Definately recommend this place  There are a number of little shops nearby  not even   mins away  to get food and other supplies needed for a self catering apartment  The airport transfers are great  There is a beach transfer  but it only goes at     am  you need to book the day before  and picks you up from the beach at  pm  no other times   But the taxis are really cheap anyway  so doesnt matter Locationwise  the GS was in a great place  Near to everything  There is also a place to book trips  and they are great  FABULOUS  GO THERE    
N =>  Ok for budget travellers but could be better Not sure how the Golden Snads get a   star rating as it really only deserves    Had booked for   nights but checked out after   to go to another hotel  Air con was noisy  tumble drier was broken  bathroom could have had a cleaner bath and tiles  Towels were changed daily and rooms done to good standard but the whole place was a bit  tired   Be aware  if you book with Expedia  find out which Golden Sands you are staying at  the picture only shows one pool view on Expedia and its certainly not Golden Sands    where we ended up  The whole area belongs to Golden Sands apartments and there are GS        and    so make sure you know where you are heading  take their phone number so the taxi driver can get directions Pool area was so disapponting as the sun disappears after lunch time so you can sit in heat  but you can t sunbathe  Not too keen on the fact Muslim women get in the pool fully dressed  full long sleeved top and leggings  Whole families fully clothed in the pool when sign clearly states correct swimwear  Good points were the free intenet access  though it was busy and you had to queue for one of the three computers  Restaurant meal was ok but breakfast was disappointing so we changed our minds and left However  it was clean and the staff were very attentive  Its a good location to get around from  but there are better in Dubai  My concern is  having been to Dubai twice now  if this was your first experience of the place  you wouldn t want to go back  
Not bad value I was booked in here as part of a tour and had a spacious studio with appliances  The washer drier was a blessing by this stage of the trip  once I mastered how to use it as there were no instructions and I had to ask for help  Sadly you can t buy only enough washing powder to do a load and have to get a big box from the supermarket  only to leave most of it behind  There is a    hour restaurant which serves pretty average western food but no alcohol  and the complimentary internet service was either very slow or not working at all  An easy walk away is the Burjurman Centre which has every type of shop imaginable  and this is also a stop on the hop on hop off tourist bus route  There is not much else within walking distance except more apartment buildings  construction sites and the odd convenience store  However this place offers better value than many hotels of a similar standard  
N => Average   a bit dull I was expecting a lot more with Golden Sands    The staff on the front desk were not very helpful  and wouldn t even book me a taxi to the airport   giving me a number to call instead  The room was ok   I had a studio room   good size  The air con was a bit noisy but at least it worked  There was no hot water  it was luke warm   not something to enjoy after a long day in town  All in all  ok to stop off for a day or two  but I couldn t wait to leave  I would probably stay on Jumeira beach next time  and pay a bit more for some luxury  
N =>   we loved it     again   I stayed at golden sands   for    nights  with my wife and   kids  This was the  nd time we were in Dubai and the  nd time we stayed at golden sands  Things hadn t changed much since   years  The same rooms  the same lobby area  the same reception area and the same fish tank   maybe even the same fish    We stayed in a   bedroom apartment  the only problem was this time we did not have a pool view room  it was a view of the car park  The hotel was wonderful  nothing extra special but it made you feel at home  The room was nice and spacious  also had fridge freezer  washing machine  cooker  The room service was fast and efficient  to me the reception staff were friendly and helpful  and suprisingly the internet speed in the lobby was fairly fast The hotel was just in the right location for us  It was only    mins walk to mina bazar  indian jewellery and clothes area       min walk to al khaleej centre  this had all the fast food shops  mcdonalds  kfc     min walk to spinneys supermarket        min walk to burjaman centre  massive shopping centre   It was ideal As i had young children the only problem i had was taxi s  they would not travel short distances they wanted to go for long journeys such as jumeirah beach  That really annoyed me  however it gave us the opportunity to go walking taking the kids in their strollers and that was an experience on its owna s we got to explore places where i don t thnk we would have noticed going in taxi  E mail me if you want to know more about the places and hints and tips if you are travelling with young children Overall a wonderful experience again  Even though this was my  nd visit and i stayed    days  it still feels that i did not have enough and i should go again and visit more days  Dubai is paradise on earth  and you can t get enough of it  
N =>  Great Value Family Self Contained Apartment The Apartment at the Golden Sands was quite roomy and being self contained this enabled us to do our washing and cook  saving us money  The apartment accommodated   people no worries It was very comfortable  roomy  neat and clean Being a modern Western woman  it annoyed me a bit that the male staff would not look me in the eye and when I asked a question  the answer was directed to my husband like I wasn t even there  No respect for women  However  this is their culture and you need to get used to it The location was a little out of the way as it is in Old Dubai and we were always catching a taxi to new Dubai as this is where most things are  However  it was less expensive to stay in this area so expense won out over convenience  
N =>   Nice apartments but dreadful experience I would not stay here again due to the customer service I personally received and the bad experience I had but have no hesitation in recommending this hotel WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION  I stayed here for a one night stopover between UK and Australia but found the excursion people not to be well equiped with dealing with short stopovers  mainly because you cannot book a trip over the phone in advance even when you are booked into the hotel  You have to do it face to face which caused me difficulties as I arrived early hours of the morning and was there for only one day  I booked my trips through southtravels com and I found them to be very helpful and the Desert Safari Trip is a must  absolutely amazing I had received my confirmation to stay in Golden Sands   but on arrival to check in was told I was in Golden Sands   so with the help of the porter made my way over to Golden Sands    I had previously phoned the hotel to explain I didnt have a credit card and the reservation had been made on my mums credit card but I would pay cash when I got there  I had exchanged enough money to cover the hotel  food  trips and incidentals   They said this would be fine and I confirmed the price I had paid through laterooms  When I tried to check in I was told I would need to give them    dirhams as a deposit on the room  I explained I didnt have a credit card and only had enough cash for the room and my food  The woman on the counter was completely unaccommodating and refused to check me in  This is very scary when you a woman travelling alone in a new country and you are told you cant check in to your hotel   I tried to explain I had phoned and would pay them cash but this wasnt good enough as I didnt have enough cash for the    dir deposit  Eventually I had to phone my parents in the UK at about  am from my mobile phone to try and get some help as by this time I was pretty distressed  They phoned me back on my mobile and offered to pay the    dirhams on their credit card but the hotel wouldnt even accept this as they said they cannot take credit cards over the phone  As you can imagine I had been extremely distressed and crying in the reception area for about    minutes now and eventually another member of staff came to see to me and said he would now check me in to my room The room was immaculate and well stocked  There were only two bad things with the room   one was that the phone worked only intermittently  The other was that the iron had a two prong plug on it but all the sockets in the room were the standard UK three prong sockets  The hotel is in a good location and taxis are extremely cheap  for an hours round trip in the taxi it cost me around   dirhams  Didn t use the restaurants  business centre or swimming pools in the hotel so cannot comment on those As long as you are aware that you have to pay the deposit this hotel would be fine  ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH LATEROOMS COM STATES ALL TAXES ETC ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRICE THE HOTEL STILL CHARGED ME A    SURCHARGE ON MY BILL    
N =>  Dubai was great  Trip report Golden Sands   in Dubai ember   th   uary  nd       The Netherlands We stayed at the Golden Sands Apartments from ember   th to uary  nd in      We had booked a   bedroom apartment for   nights at Golden Sands   including breakfast  dinner   transfer from the airport and return flight with KLM Royal Dutch AirlinesWe had a late flight from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and we arrived just after midnight  During the check in  we discovered that there was a fault in their booking  We had to proof that we had booked a   bedroom apartment including half board  The receptionist would not believe it and gave us a   room apartment and breakfast  We had to pay     Dirhams  AED  deposit before we got our key  We were very angry and tired at that time The next morning another receptionist contacted us and apologised for the mistake  He had sent an email to the touroperator in Holland and they confirmed our booking  We moved to our new apartment on the  th floor  It was big and clean  See the pictures attached Facilities  Living room with two sofas and television Extra bedroom with king size bed  A kitchen with a refrigerator and a machine to make tea Washing machine Two closets Two bathrooms Table with   chairsFrom our balcony we had a view over Golden Sands Apartments    On the website of Golden Sands  we had read that there was a free shuttle service to Jumeirah Beach Park  but you have to reservate a seat otherwise it was not possible to sit in the bus If you want to go to the Hilton Jumeirah Beach  you have to pay    Dirhams per person at the reception Breakfast and dinner We had already paid for breakfast and dinner in HollandBreakfast was at               p m  The buffet was not tasty  We didn t enjoy breakfast all  Sometimes it was very crowded in the restaurant so you have to wait for a table Dinner  Was a la carte  We could order a menu including desert for    Dirhams per person  If we order above    Dirhams  we have to pay for it Dubai was great Bye bye  Dubai  
Nowhere near the Golden Sands of Dubai I was quite disappointed with this hotel   I had such high expectations for Hotels in Dubai  It wasnt cheap  it was dearer than a good   star here in ireland but lacked the quality  The rooms are big and the staff are friendly  if you re a man   The bed was very comfortable and was pretty quiet  Thats the good part  The room was very dated and was dirty in places   particularly the bath  I found that the staff were fine with me but quiet abrupt with my girlfriend  especially those on the front desk  The location of the hotel is quiet a bit away from all the major attractions in Dubai  Its about a    min drive from the Mall of the Emirates and a    min drive from the beach and about a    minute drive from the Burj Al Arab  Getting home at night was a pain too as the traffic was awful  spent hours in traffic one night  If you are travelling in Dubai at night  dont bother going anywhere at rush hour in the evening  The city is at a standstill  If I was return to Dubai I definitly would not stay in this hotel  I would stay in Jumeriah  Thats where all the attractions are and where most of the visitors to Dubai are    We got a bit of hassle from locals in our area because my gf had her arms uncovered which I personally thought was rediculous  especially as everyone was dressed very liberally  That is something you may come into contact with in Dubai  Despite what people tell you  some of the locals can be rude to and dismissive of westerners  We were taunted on   occasions  Guys also leer at western women    I got pretty annoyed about this after a while as cars were slowing down to check my girlfriend out and groups of men would stare  These are things you will have to consider if you are visiting Dubai  Another thing is that there is no public transport  Taxis are ok but the drivers are hit  amp  miss  some can be friendly some can be rude  same as everywhere I guess   It used to cost us about    euro to go to the beach which was about a    min journey  They are building a metro system in Dubai and I probably would not return to Dubai until this is completed  I would definitely not stay in the Golden Sands again as I felt it was over priced and in a bad location  Check out Jumeriah  especially if you have kids  
N =>   Nice for families singles stay away  This is a series of hotel appartements building  around    buildings in Dubai  Good things    Flat are spacious  Clean and contains all household items you may need    Swimming pool and Gym are nice    Place is perfect for long family stay Bad ones   Very basic furniture  No TV sets in bed rooms    No Internet in the flat    Isolated place far from main roads  used to wait up to one hour to get a taxi    Staff are not very friendly and they usually find execuses rather than trying to find solutions Overall  it is not wise option for any single or business traveller  But perfect for families staying for a long time  
N =>   Home from Home Just returned from   week at the Golden Sands    GS    On arrival they had booked us in the GS  even though they had confirmed to me by email that we would be in a quiet room at GS   we preferred GS  due to the pool being on the roof top  with better views and especially more sun all through the day  After complaining they managed to find us a quiet room in GS  but a much larger one  so we got upgraded  we were very exited  and glad that we had insisted  The room  no      was so big  to USA standard   fully equipped and in very good condition  we only paid     per night  including the    service charge  using booking com and the room was worth much more  I would expect in Dubai at least      per night  We were very happy with our room  we used the kitchen every morning for breakfast  and were always impressed to return at night to an immaculate room  yes they did the washing up too   It s more an hotel than an apartment A  quot quick quot  note about taxis  they are not easy to get outside the hotel  as it s a quiet street  you will need to go to GS   which is more popular  or try the more busy street nearby if you don t want to wait for    minutes  They also don t organise taxis for you  even to the airport so we had problems getting a taxi at     am to catch our flight  We did check with the receptionist the previous night who told us it would be no problem to get a taxi outside at     am  however we waited    minutes  there was another couple in front of us waiting for a taxi also but on their way to the office  so we didn t stand much luck  we ended up using their free airport bus at  am  saving about     but man we were stressed out and worried that we would miss our flight  Luckily there was no traffic and it took us    minutes to get to the airport  compared to the usual    minutes at this time of day  Overall  good hotel  great location  friendly staff but clueless receptionists and concierge  Don t even ask them recommendations on restaurants  they won t know However I would certainly return there next time I go to Dubai  
N =>   Simply put   star prices gets you   star quality We were really pleased when we saw our apartment  I would say that compared to the ones we have stayed at in Europe   the furnishings are most certainly   star   Everyone we spoke to were pleased too  They were very clean BUT our elecricity was tempremental  and on three days out of six we had to call the electrician  who came up immediately and put it back on  The lights did not go off but the cooker  tv or fridge would  if i put the washer on  or the kettle The balcony is not really big enought to sit on  but we were out most of the time and there is always the pool area which is fine At nights i would have just liked to have had a place to sit outside just for a night cap  The bathroom toilet does not have any windows and i did not like not having the opportunity to open a window   The staff are brilliant and the restaurant is reasonable  For example toasted cheeses sandwich chips and salad is about     Food is good The apartments are so reasonable  and gave us extra money to do the trips  which were fantastic  You cant pay three star prices and expect   star luxury Although we had a few problems the staff were helpful and tried to resolve them instantly  It is only    to get a cab to the nearest beach and in my view the location is great  We want to return next year  
N =>   Cheap and Cheerful  Well  when we got there to GS   we d asked for an early check in for my elderly father    but the staff refused us  They were unhelpful to us and we waited   and a half hours for our room  The room was lovely  just what we needed  The pool looked good  I personally didn t use it but sat nearby in the sun  It was good  There was a man who used to clean our apartment every day  he was very helpful with cleaning and giving us advice  I ve been to Dubai before but this is the first time I have stayed here  I would use it again  Difficult to get taxis though  but that has no relevence to GS  Basically  cheap and cheerful  
N =>  Fab Holiday Myself and a friend stayed at GS   The room was immaculate  The staff were friendy  The pool facility was average  it could have done with a few more sun loungers  but to be honest if your a sun worshiper like myself you would be better off going to Jumeirah Beach as you lost the sun a  pm by the pool  But be aware residents going to the Hilton get priority over Jumeirah Beach on the free bus  
N =>  GS  To be recommended    I booked this hotel apartment based on reviews that I read here on tripadvisor  I have to say that after spendng  wks in this hotel  I would recommend it to anybody  Dubai is expanding rapidly  so there is no real centre to it Basically Its a very long road which keeps getting longer as the construction continues  Bur Dubai is considered Old Dubai but it is still a lovely area although not as many tourists  In Dubai u must get a taxi EVERYWHERE They re cheap but its frustrating that they have no public transport except limited buses which only seem to be used by the locals  THis hotel is not near the beach but it provides a shuttle to the public beach every morning  It costs    to enter the beach  The hotel also provides a shuttle service to the private beach at the Hilton Jumeriah  It costs     per person per day but well worth it under the extreme heat conditions  U receive towels  umbrellas  sun loungers  access to pool  beach  wet facecloths are given out every few hours which are a godsend etc   Can be costly if you decide to go everyday  GS  is lovely there are approx    different buildings  Food is not great in the hotel but there is a lovely cheap restaurant straight across the road called Grande and I would defo recommend it  If you have limited time and want to experience the best trip attraction definitely go dune bashing in the desert  
N =>  excellent we stayed at golden sands     which i s connected to golden sands    there is nothing bad i could find to say about the   nights we had there  the staff could not do enough for you  the food in the resturant was great value   and a good standard  and service excellent  i am a person with high standards  and i think the comment from the person from ireland   must of meant they did not stay in the same place as we did  
N =>   Worst hotel in Dubai I have very bad memorys for this hotel   Old rooms with old furnitures    We had to call to get soap to our room    Only hot water  Not cold   old travel tv  No microwaves  Cloth drying machine didn t work  Shampoos smelled bad  Welcome back is only small bottle of water     old and rusty hangers  mosquitos  Very old safety box   Hotel demand     dirhams from customer before they will give the key  
N =>   Hot Nights We stayed at the Golden Sands    for two nights  Arrived early morning   did not know about the free transfer bus  and our room was ready  Upgraded for free to a one bed ensuite   fantastic  spacious  clean  aircon  Helpful  efficient staff  Two small pools available  Cafe serving breakfast  lunch etc  Taxis easy to get outside  We walked to the Ramada     mins away  for the pub inside and the Bur Juman shopping centre where we took the city tour bus  Dubai is much bigger than we expected with an enormous amount of construction which appears to leave a grey dusty cloud hanging over the city  It was good to feel warm in the evening walking about  We took a taxi to Bar    at the Grosvenor House Hotel for cocktails  this took about    mins in clear traffic  We liked Dubai and would return  Not being fond of hotels we would be happy to self cater at the Golden Sands  we certainly did not think it was of poor quality and we too have travelled extensively  Perhaps we were lucky  
N =>  Dubai on a Budget    is there such a thing     Booked this hotel mainly due to the reasonable cost but after reading a few reviews on the Trip Advisor  we were slightly worried as to what we might find on arrival  However  we went with no expectations and were pleasantly surprised  We stayed at Golden Sands   and there are many different blocks  so i cant comment about others  Our Studio room was clean  well equipped  modern with all mod cons  The beds were comfortable  great TV channels and nice lounge area The pool was small but again  due to the cost of the accomdation at this hotel compared to others in dubai  this really wasnt a big deal  There is a free shuttle to Jumeirah Hilton Hotel  but they also charge     a day per person to use the facilities which they failed to mention anywhere until we tried to go The hotel is a short walk from the BurJuman shopping centre which has a great cafe  quot Pauls quot  which has fab food  suitable for breakfast and lunch  There is also supermarkets within a short walk  You can even get Pizza Hut delivered if you cant be bothered to go out  Watch out for the taxis as during rush hour  they pick and choose where they go  as they do not get paid at all whilst you are stationary in a cab  so you have to be quite forceful and just get in and almost refuse to budge if they try to say no   They are paid by the government and cannot refuse to take you  They just dont like to  so they pcik and choose fares when its busy I would definately reccommend the hotel  it was clean and had everything we wanted  If you have a bigger budget then there are lots of luxury   star hotels  Grosvenor Hotel  Royal Mirage etc  but then you will be paying nearly   times more per night   great if you can afford it  if not Golden sands is perfectly nice  
N =>  Excellent Stayed at Golden Sands   for   days from   th  to   th  Hotel Apartments are very clean  rooms large with cooking and washing facilities  Both   and   face one another in a quite area  but close to mina bizzare  shopping  Staff are very friendly  Free internet access  but this can be hit and miss if it works or not  Great pool area and pool was great to cool off  Free shuttle bus to the beach everyday  Evening meal wasn t excellent  I chose to go to other hotels to eat in the evening as Golden Sands was way behind other hotels in this field  Breakfast was  quot okay quot   Pool menu  quot great quot   Overall an excellent hotel apart from evening meal  
N =>  Never Again The staff were unfriendly  the rooms were smelly  the food in the apartments was disgusting We came in our room to find one of the staff come out the bathroom looking quite shook up  I then went into the toilet later to find the sink had sick in it   we assume from him Staff were very impersonal and never said bye  thanks or anything The pool was lucky if ten people could fit in it IF YOU GO HEAR DO NOT EXPECT MUCH       
Nice apartments This was the third time staying at the hotel  Has gone down a little bit  The staff are very rude  no smiles or anything  Not willing to help in anyway  not the service as before  Stayed here because of the location and the fact we stayed there before The room only cleaned every other day it is the new hotel policy  they do not clean the apartment everyday  I would probably stay again as it was cheaper then other options  
N => GREAT    There are    Golden Sands Hotels all next to each other      in the making  all owned by Arenco who own lots of properties  amp  Hotels in Dubai  We stayed at the Golden Sands    our taxi driver told us this is one of the best ones  amp  is also the most popular one    st     th       The rooms are very nice  with sofas  a small dining table  amp  a kitchen area  where you have a fridge freezer  cooker  kettle  amp  even a washing machine  I think all the rooms have a balcony  ours was facing the street  front of the hotel  which could be noisy at times  but we did not mind  The rooms was also air con  The bathroom was small but clean  amp  all white  Also we had an iron  amp  ironing board  There is also a safe in the room in the wardrobe There is free internet access donstairs in the lobby  there are   PCs in the  quot business centre quot   amp    just near the lifts   these can be really slow  amp  sometimes did not work Also the hotel has an office where you can go  amp  book your tours  amp  outings  you can book the desert safari here also for half the price that you would pay if you pre booked with Expedia   Recommended  We only ate lunch twice at the hotel  They offer buffet breakfast  lunch  amp  dinner  We had the buffet lunch the  st time  amp  the  nd time we just ordered off the menu as it could get quite boring  Their salad table was pretty nice  This hotel does not have a bar  amp  does not serve any alcohol Outside in the pool are  the pool is quite small  Not ideal for swimming  but just lazing about or cooling off  There are also sun loungers available but you have to get there pretty early  The hotel does not provide towels for the pool area  Best thing to do is take your room towels then just ask for new towels when you get back to your room The service here is really good  the staff are always helpful  amp  eager to help  as we had a roblem with one of our excusions  amp  they really went out of their way to help There are also taxis outide ready to take you where you want to go  A Taxi to Jumerieh Beach is under   Dh  There are also   supermarkets close by     min walk in the heat   Choitram  amp  Sons  amp  also Spinneys Also would advice make reservations to the Rooftop Bar   The One amp Only Royal Mirage Hotel   this was amazing  Try  amp  get there before sunset Hope this was helpful  
N =>  lovely hotel we stayed here for a week in april  the hotel was lovely  the staff were very friendly  the only disappointment was the pool as it was quite small  but still it wasnt too bad as my daughter loved it  this hotel was ideal for us as it was nearby to all shopping centres and the beach  the most we spent on a taxi to a shopping mall  i think was about    aed which was about     not bad at all   there was a complimentary shuttle bus to jumeirah beach which we used   times  there were always taxis outside the hotel waiting to take you anywhere you wanted  there was also a local supermarket   spinneys  which had everything you needed   it was a shame they didnt have a hairdryer in the room but again i asked them for one and they bought it up for me  the service we received from golden sands was brilliant  the staff were always willing to help us no matter what time it was  there is a vast amount of construction going on in dubai  and especially jumeirah road    im so glad we didnt pay all that money and stay in jumeirah hotel as you would of been able to hear construction work all the time  i would definitely recommend golden sands   at any time and would go back there myself  i just wish we d stayed a bit longer  
N =>  Good hotel  Stayed there for  nigths  The room was smelly  staff were not so polite no smile     no children playing facility in Golden sands   amp   you have to walk to golden sands      min walk from     I was very disappointed with this hotel  I wouldn t recommend here really    
N => Very bad DON T book this  hotel  Very bad hotel  not hygienic  old furniture  bad pool  bad neighbourhood  no shops  very very bad breakfast  DON T stay here     
Not bad at all  We stayed at Golden Sands           in a studio room and were pleasantly surprised after reading some of the write ups on this site  Room was large   contained a queen size bed  three and two seater sofa  small dining table and kitchenette  microwave  two hobs  fridge freezer and washing machine   All the rooms have a balcony area too  or and furniture was contemporary  Two swimming pools  both very clean  however avoid the  st floor pool if you don t like kids splashing about  go to the rooftop one  Free access to internet  speed  not great but acceptable   Gym contains all the basic gym equipment  freeweights    treads  cycle  rowing etc  but the air con was faulty  There is nothing fancy about the about Golden Sands but rooms are clean and service was efficient and friendly  Location is good  plentiful taxis  cost less than       to the creek  souks etc and about       to the sail looking hotel  There is the Grand Supermarket across the road  but don t go there   expensive   go to Spinneys    min walk where you ll also get a better choice of goods  even sells various Waitrose items  As for the ladies  and a couple of gentlemen  of the night  all very harmless  they won t bother you if you don t approach them  They are reasonably well dressed  not like the kind you see in Soho  We would have no problems staying there again  
N => Good value for the price We  two adults  two children  stayed at Golden Sands   on our last night in Dubai having previously stayed in the    Oasis Beach in Jumeirah  I suspect that we got one of the refurbished rooms because everything was in excellent order  It can t compare with the Oasis Beach but  heck  it cost one third of the price  For that price it was spacious  two room studio consists of a double bedroom  two single beds in the living room  two bathrooms   shower not bath   and basic kitchenette   the kids loved the  rather slow  free internet and enjoyed swimming at  pm at night when the smallish pool was warm but deserted Top feature was the poolside restaurant where the food was excellent value for a hotel and mountains of it  e g  excellent mixed grill   think Middle Eastern not European   for    Dirham   The same food can be delivered to your room by room service for about two Dirham extra per dish  That s virtually the same price as restaurants and self service mall food courts  If you want to self cater there s a Spinney s supermarket     yards away  These apartments are a good way to experience Dubai without paying the sometimes exorbitant Dubai hotel prices  It s not four or five star  it doesn t claim to be  but  from our experience  provides friendly service and excellent value for money One final point  Yes  there are a handfull of ladies of the night who congregate around one street corner not far from the hotel  But I ve seen them in other parts of Dubai not far from four and five star hotels  It s no different from other big cities  they are easily avoided if you want to and caused no problems to us  Definitely not a reason to avoid this hotel  
N =>  OK but wouldn t go back  We spent   nights at Golden Sands   as part of a stopover  The rooms are very big and it was very useful to have a washing machine in the room  especially as the soaring temperatures meant that we couldn t wear the same clothes twice  Although the room was generally clean it was in dire need of modernisation  they have started doing this already on the bottom floor   Beware of hanging any clothes up to dry in the bathroom as we managed to get rust patches on some things that had been hung up there  The balcony was very small and not the type that you could sit on to relax as it seemed as the birds liked to mark the territory as their own making it very dirty  The pool area is quite grotty  the sun loungers were dirty and there were no umbrellas around as shown in the pictures  The pool itself was the same temperature as a bath due to the heat  The free internet in the lobby is useful but a bit slow and you may have to queue for it  The staff at reception are the most unfriendly people that I think I have ever encountered  They talked to us as if we were dogs on the street and we were constantly treating us as if we were people who had just walked in off the street who weren t entitled to be there  For example we asked what time the shuttle bus to the beach left and the response was a stony look followed by an enquiry as to which room we were in before they would tell us  Similarly when we asked about how to use the internet we were told you just had to wait and then it was free  we did so and when we got on the internet we once again got interrogated as to our room number despite having just spoken to them  This wouldn t have been so strange if it was happening to everyone but we were the only people this was happening to  All in all it was OK but there is no chance that we will be returning

Nice The hotel is indeed in a construction area with a  quot semi paved quot  access road  As I arrived late  I was confused when the taxi driver began driving across dirt lots  but all ended well  The room was comfortable  the breakfast quite good and the restaurant had some tasty options  The Mall of the Emirates and it s weird ski slope was nearby and the location was good for some things but a long way from  quot downtown quot  ie the Creek  It was a perfectly fine hotel and once they pave the roads and finish the Metro  it will be great  
Nesting in Construction I was recently in Dubai for the    Boat Show In relation to the pricey hotels near the show the Tulip was a good option  It was over all a good stay and the quality of the rooms  service and food was over all very pleasant  But somehow on the internet they forgot to mention that the Tulip is the only finished building on the block  In other words all the other buildings are still under construction  There isn t even tarmac to the hotel  So as you can imagine   NOISYYY not to mention Dusty But the location is great  beside the Emirates mall and Near the Burl al Arab and beaches   so Over all OK  
N =>   Good business hotel in Dubai Good business hotel  small but decent restaurant for dinner breakfast  nice sports bar and even a night club in the hotel  However I slightly heard the base from the night club up to my room on the fourth level  Good internet access  to plug in my laptop I had to move the desk  which was a bit disappointing Good location  on Sheikh Zaed Road close to Mall of the Emirates  However the area around the hotel is fully under construcation and only dirt tracks lead to the hotel  
N => Fantastic hotel  We stayed at this hotel for   nights at the end of ober and had such a great time we booked it for our return stopover for   nights mid ember When we arrived on our first stopover we were really tired and just wanted to get to our room and relax as it had taken a little longer to get out the airport then we thought it would  We were offered a drink while they sorted out our room and did what ever they had to with our passports  I dont know if it was just due to the tiredness and the fact we had   hyper little children with us that check in seemed to take a while  Anyways once that was sorted out we were shown to our room and the manager gave us his card and said to call him direct if we needed anything which was nice of him  We had booked a Deluxe room but were really suprised when we were shown to our room and seen it    we had been upgraded to a suite which was fantastic  the room was huge  very reaxing  very clean and the bathroom was lovely  We had breakfast included which we had in the restaurant  there was a fantastic selection of hot and cold food   there was everything you could want and more  The coffe was great and my hubby and I are quite fussy when it comes to coffee We used the pool which is on the roof  its not that big but it does the job when all you want to do is jump the kids round  the staff there were very quick to bring you towles and to clear away after people left  The pool is ment to be temp controlled but it was a little chilly but you got used to it after a while The hotel is in a good location for eveything  taxis are really easy to get or you can use the ones outside the hotel which we did once and it was about  dhs more which isnt much really if you just want to get where your going  If you get a taxi back to the hotel say its just before the Capitol hotel otherwise they might not know where it is or like what happend to us be taken to a differnt hotel and have to get firm with the taxi driver that it was not our hotel   On our return stopover we stayed for   nights and we were lucky again to be upgraded and this time when we got there check in was super fast  We got to our room and it looked lovely again and they had also set up two travel cots for our little boys  A few of the staff remembered us from last time and again were great with the boys  which is always nice when you go anywhere with little kids This time as we got in at  am we orded some room service  nothing great just a pizza to take us through until we could feast on the breakfast  The pizza was lovely and the service was very prompt We really enjoyed our stay here and would recomend this hotel to anyone who was going to Dubai on business or for a stopover  I think if you were staying any longer than a week you would want to be in a more  quot holiday type hotel quot   especially if you had little kids with you The only thing that I could say about it which wasnt great was I had no where to plug in my straightners next to a mirror    to my hubbys delight as we got out the door    mins quicker     Ohh and the bed was really good  and even better knowing they are new   
N => 	days stay splendid view  excellent service  courteous staff  super clean room  amp  sparkling bathroom with all amenities  
Nice stay I would come again  One night staying there is more than enough to know how great this hotel is  Nice lobby  excellent staff  My room was spacy  furniture and decoration  however  was not the nicest i have seen  they could do much better job  One thing is sure  this hotel has the best variety of Restaurants  amazing food in all of them  great swimming pool  there is a cinema complex just next door  really nothing would rally have to leave this place since it got all what you need and more  
N => Perfect room Impressed by the unique lobby area which was wonderfully eye catching   At check in we were generously upgraded and our extremely spacious n cosy room had a great view  It was luxuriously laid out and there was a generous provision of toiletries  All said  room was in perfect condition and nothing to gripe over  Although overall service was really great in every aspect  i felt letdown by the long half an hour wait for our luggage to be delivered to the room although we check in close to midnite and the hotel was not busy at that point in time  We stayed for   days but only had fruit delivered once  The inexperienced concierge was not very helpful in making any worthwhile recommendation on sightseeing in Dubai  Also at check out  the hotel wanted to charge us for complimentary beverage but it was resolved  Except for these issues  the team at Hyatt Dubai deserved a perfect score for their excellent service  
N =>  Excellent Hotel great location but staff could be a little more attentive Hi we have just returned from   nights at the Hyatt and I can t rate it high enough  The rooms are fantastic with good sized beds and massive bathrooms  The breakfasts are simply amazing with a massive selection to suit everyone  We had dinner in the hotel on our second night in the indian restaurant IZ which was beautiful  We watched the chef make our breads before they are served and the food was to die for  BUT  we did feel the staff were not very engaging and felt remote  We normally stay at the Al Qsar in Jumeriah were the staff always say hello and got to he ends of the end to sort anything out  We will definately stay again and recommend to others 
N =>   Nice hotel We visited this hotel in winter      As we traveled with our   months old baby we booked double room  but we get two separate beds which was ok since we managed to join them  I liked big spacious bathroom  big garden with pools and jogging paths  We went to sushi restaurant and it was ok  but the food in the hotel is quit expensive  The breakfast was more you can wish for  fresh orange juice  choices of paincakes  cheese  even eggs came in different shapes  There were a garden inside the hotel  I didn t like the A C as it was always too hot or freezing  You cand arrange for internet in the room  but you have to pay for it  Also you need a taxi to go outside the hotel  there is nothing around to visit  The good part is that the taxi is no problem and it is just few minutes away from shopping areas  Overall   very nice  I would go back  
N =>   Nice hotel in a good location The Grand Hyatt is a good hotel in a great location  Located next to Wafi mall  it is well located for most things in Deira and it s easy to get to Jumeirah  outside of peak traffic times  from here  We stayed in a grand club room which gave us access to the private lounge including transfers to from the airport  breakfast  drinks  canap s  access to the business centre etc and is definitely worth paying the extra cost Food in the lounge lacked variety but was tasty and while the choice of non alcoholic drinks was limited they did have a good selection of fruit juice  Alcoholic drinks were available between    pm which definitely makes it worth paying the extra room cost as alcohol in Dubai is expensive Our room on the   th floor had amazing views of the creek and city  The room was large  light and airy  but lacked things that you would normally find such as an iron or stationary  The bed was extremely big  but a little too hard for us  The bath room was large  with a big and powerful shower  a small separate bath and the toilet was hidden away behind a frosted glass door  Annoyingly the hairdryer wasn t very good  so if like me you like to dry your hair in   minutes  bring your own  The quality of food at the hotel is mixed  We had room service and ate at Andiamo s and Sushi which were all excellent  But unfortunately the pool bar restaurant was of poor quality and taste The hotel pool is large  but there was a lot of maintenance work going on around the pool while people were in it which was a little disconcerting  As the pool is so big it s a shame that there is no in pool bar  particularly as the pool side service is very slow  However the pool is temperature controlled so it was nice to be able to have a swim despite it feeling a little cold in the wind Unfortunately we did have one argument with the hotel who tried to impose a compulsory charge on us for the New Year s Eve celebrations  We were not told about the charge when we confirmed our reservation nor upon checking in  so we were rather angry when a rude member of staff phoned us in our room to say that the charge was being applied and then hung up the phone  We spoke to the manager Ashwin about this who agreed that his staff were sometimes a little abrupt and apologised about not telling us about the charge in advance  He was very courteous and explained the charge covered unlimited alcoholic drinks  a laser show and an indoor fireworks display  and he then gave us time to go away and think about whether or not we would like to be involved in the celebrations  While wondering around the hotel and discussing whether or not to go to the Grand Hyatt party  the events people at the hotel were practicing the laser show and fireworks in the lobby and based on what we saw we decided that it was not worth was      AED to join in the celebrations   it would have been cheaper to clear out the minibar instead Ashwin was very understanding and let us off the charge  As it turned out celebrations were cancelled by Sheikh Mohammad and the hotel was only allowed to do something low key  but the hotel still didn t let guests off the charge  they had to pay irrespective We chose the Grand Hyatt as my husband had been here on business  The hotel is good considering the number of rooms that it manages  but it lacks the magic that you find in many of Dubai s other hotels  But is makes a good base if it s your first time or if you don t know Dubai very well  But if you are looking for some of Dubai s charm  you won t find it here  
N =>   Wow WOW what an awesome hotel  This is truely a   star     hotel  Everything about our stay was wonderful  The staff was also very nice and helpful  i can t wait to go back  I highly recommend this hotel  No negatives to report  
N =>  Good location good service  It is near to the airport and shopping malls  The lobby garden is well maintained to a five star level  The rooms are not as fancy as the lobby  but still agreeable  
N =>  Excellent once again We have just returned from another wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt  in Dubai  This was our  rd stay at the hotel  which we initially booked for   nights  but enjoyed it so much  we extended it for a further   nights  mid stay Flew overnight  from Heathrow  on Emirates and arrived at the hotel at  am Although we were not entitled to a room until  pm  the hotel was not full and we went through the usual check in procedure  you are in a standard city view room  would you like to pay to upgrade to a city view room   we declined   swipe the credit card and they handed us our key  As we walked away to go to our room  we were called back  One more thing  Mr  amp  Mrs Fisher  sadly our swimming pool is out of use and we wish to make available to you  the facilities at our sister hotels the Park Hyatt and Hyatt Regency  Again we declined  saying that we didn t want to spend all day going backwards and forwards between hotels  We asked to see the manager  who was of course  unavailable  We said that we would see him later  I was not happy about this situation  at all  I had been in daily e mail contact with the hotel asking various things and this had not been mentioned once We went to the room and unpacked and headed to the pool to see what was going on  The   children s pools were OK and lots of adults were just hanging around there and sitting in the water to cool off  when necessary  The main pool had been completely drained and was being re tiled and repaired   cleaned  where necessary  Apparently a water inlet pipe had burst underground and had pumped dirty water into the pool meaning it had to be drained  cleaned and re filled  Whilst it was empty it made sense to make any required repairs  be this was true  but it was a bit of a coincidence that it was coming to the end of Ramadan and the hotel was only half full Anyway  the manager visited our room that evening and we made the point that to us  as tourists  the pool was the hotels biggest selling point and is what makes it in our opinion the best hotel in the city  The manager offered us complimentary dinners  Manhattan Grill Steakhouse and Peppercrab Seafood  for the days that we would be without a pool  we agreed that a fixed amount of credit be set against our account  per day  Personally  we prefer to eat out and about and this meant we weren t tied to spending it on specific nights  in specific places The main pool returned to full use on our third day and we got on with enjoying our holiday  We enjoyed it so much  that we asked what our credit would by us in terms of extra nights  The manager agreed that if we paid a discounted rate for one extra night  they would use our credit to give us a  nd extra night and then upgrade us  free  for the rest of our stay to Grand Club  We had to pay extra to Emirates to change the date of our return flight  but the savings on our bar bill  during the  pm  pm cocktail hour probably paid for that  anyway  We ate out at Thai Chi  excellent  as always  and Carters at Wafi City  We did suffer at Carters  on the night we had pre dinner drinks there before going into Thai Chi  They have a  pm    pm Happy Hour  where drinks prices are reduced  We ordered our last round of drinks at      and the bar man seemed to be unusually slow in pouring them and then when I asked to pay the bill  he again seemed to be taking as long as he could  He passed me the bill and all of the drinks were full price  I asked what happened to Happy Hour and he pointed out that the bill was printed at     pm  Sharp practice  but the manager did his job and sorted it out  although i did have to threaten to cancel our dinner reservation there for the following night  When we did return the next day  the service was excellent These incidents are excellent examples of the way things should be handled and after hearing some of the horror stories coming out of the Atlantis opening week  these are the reasons that we shall return to Grand Hyatt  Dubai  very soon  
N =>   Loved the hotel but     We stayed   nights at the Grand Hyatt as part of a   night stopover on the way to Athens  We had upgraded our room to a Creek View  After a    hour flight  we arrived to find  quot no rooms available quot  and sat in the foyer for over   hours  We were exhausted and not impressed  I was told they could find a room if Iwepaid an additional       I said No to that  Whilst I realise that we were there before normal check in time  flights from the east coast of Australia all arrive early in the morning  but our onward trip also means that we leave early in the morning  As these stopovers are promoted and the hotel agrees to be part of it  I felt it was very unprofessional  I know we paid over        for the   nights Apart from that experience  It is a magnificent hotel with wonderful facilities  The dining is superb and the rooms are spacious and comfortable with excellent bathrooms  
N =>  Fabulous Hotel  We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for   nights after we had been to the Maldives  The Hotel was amazing  When we arrived there were doormen to open the taxi doors for us  Check in was quick  The room was huge and that was a standard room  There were red roses  chocolates and wine for us as we were on our honeymoon  The bathroom was huge too The pool was lovely  the sunbeds very comfortable and cold towels were brought round frequently  We didnt eat by the pool as there werent many vegetarian options for us  We had breakfast at the ket Cafe      out of this world  There was so much to choose from  we ate so much we didnt need lunch  We ate in the hotel one night for dinner at the Japanese noodle place  but the service was slow and disappointing The staff were all very friendly and the hotel was beautiful inside  especially the whole garden effect  The location was good  you pretty much have to take taxis everywhere esp cos of the heat  but the taxis were cheap  I would deffo recommend this hotel  infact i would stay there again in the future  
N =>   Grand Hyatt fail to honour quotes We contacted the Grand Hyatt Dubai by email and they replied promptly with an acceptable quote  When we called them  from New Zealand  to give them our credit card details as they requested we were told they wouldn t honour the price emailed and we would have to pay an extra      per night    I was told to go back to the website and try to see prices there   I have no Idea why  so i instead forwarded the quote  I received a call and was told again the price wouldn t be honured  UNBELIEVABLE I was also surprised by how aloof all the people i dealt with were Perhaps Dubai itself is overrated       
N =>   Very very good Me and my family stayed at Grand Hyatt for   nights from may    to may     I have to say that the hotel is absolutely beautiful  Pools  gardens  lobby  rooms  views  everything  Since I like architecture and design very much  I enjoyed every detail of it  I definitely recommend to visit the hotel  however  I have to mention some problems  First  don t take a room near an elevator  The elevator itself is not a problem  but trolleys used by the staff make loud sound  And they start really early  Another problem was the ket cafe It was nice  the variety of meals offered was good  but I consider the quality of it to be much lower than the hotel class  It is true  that it was the cheapest option but surely not that cheap  I ate there only twice  but I was also disappointed twice  These were the only problems we experienced during our stay  which was  apart from them  truly exceptional  
N =>   Nice hotel and location BUT We arrived at the Grand Hyatt at       on  st e and check in was perfect with no waiting and with all the booking confimrmed we were given our pass and told where lifts were No cool towels or welcome fruit juice drink was supplied   we have always been given these at any other hotel in DXB  The room we had was on the  th floor with a Creek view and was larger than I expected and did have a nice view especially at night when we were getting ready to go out or when we were coming back in However on the rooms we had to complain right away as when I turned back the sheets I found they were soiled and obviously had not been changed for our arrival Other issues with the room was that it was not being serviced properly and on Tuesday it still had not been done by  pm and on the Thursday we had the lads coming in to do the evening turndown before the room was done for the morning servicing Apart from the room issues we had a good time at the hotel although a little more information about it would have been helpful as there were not any signs at any of the desks to say who was what regards check in concierge or anything Breakfast in the ket Cafe was good and a plentiful selection was available although no individual ommlettes were available Everything else was good about it and there should be no problem in getting something filling no matter how fussy an eater anyone is We tried a meal there in the evening but would not go there at night again as it was not as good thenManhattan Grill was also a good restaurant although we had to wait over an hour for a table as we had not pre booked one even although it was nearly empty Wox restaurant we found to be excellent and would really recommend a visit here The water features in the main hotel are nice and the foyer was well laid out with meeting areas Pools the outdoor pool was great and when the heat became too much then the indoor pooland jacuzzi was a luxury not to be missed The hotel itself must be about the quitest we have been to in DXB as regards no noise around the rooms or hallways and doors that shut without banging Overall it was a good stay and would think about going there again if we wanted a city hotel At checkout we were asked how our stay was and when we pointed out the problems on the room issue the hotel manager came over and expressed deep concern that we had had a problem and took notes of what our complaints were and advised us to ask for him if we come back again to the hotel  My overall view of the hotel was of a very good hotel good for business clients as well as tourists and ideally situated for getting about also with no building work around it to speak of it is always quiet and relaxing 
Name say it all I just returned home from   nights at the Grand Hyatt DubaiI booked a deluxe room in the sixth floor Room was large and includes all you need Access to Spa and pool from each floor in a separate left which was great Hot Stone Message was something not to be missedConcierge and great local women staff at reception was something I likedInternet cost was   Dhr per mnt so at is much wise to take     Dhs per accessLobby was unique and loved the piano play in the eveningsRestaurants was great I think one of the best in town I tried Manhattan Grill and was great as will Sushi and AwtarI recommend this hotel for big families also for business and honeymoonersDefiantly will have a great and unique stayAboaziz 
N =>  Wow  Wow What a hotel  Absolutely loved it  The service at the hotel is really what makes it  the staff couldnt  do enough for us  An example     our bags didn t arrive on the flight with us  but we got a call at    the next morning to say the hotel had rang the airport on our behalf  found out that our bags had arrived and sent a car to collect them and they d be delivered up to our room in    mins It was too hot while we were there to use the outdoor pool  but the indoor pool spa was fantastic  We went on our last night and found an amazing candlelit pool  the changing rooms have complementary bottled water  robes  slippers etc  We were very disappointed we had only discovered it on our last night  Didn t have breakfast included in the rate but did have room service once or twice which was gorgeous  Not to mention the lovely little chocs that were waiting on arrival Literally couldn t find fault with the hotel  
Nice big hotel at not the best location I have been in Dubai satying at Grand Hyatt on a comapny conference  The hotel was perfect  five stars in all aspect  The room was clean and spacious  the staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel is really huge       rooms    or seven restaurants  and a rain forest in the lobby    You can not miss the wellness area  The location of the hotel is not perfect to visit the city  It tooks       minutes to go into the city center by taxi  However taxis are cheap in dubai  The ride to the city costs    USD The airport is quite close  not more than  minutes by taxi  The good thing  that however the airport is close  you can not hear it at all I can advise this hotel for everyone who can afford it  However you can find smaller hotels with   or   stars less  you bet  you will feel the difference  closer to the city center for third price  
Nice Hotel I stayed here many times  this is my favorite hotel in Dubai Centrally located  near to everything The lobby is huge  and it has a lot of good restaurants I stayed in the standard room and creek view room  the creek view room is fantastic  it s more spacious with better view I really recommend this hotel  
N =>   Luxury option near airport My husband was in Dubai for work and was booked into this hotel  My son and I joined him for a few nights  Like everything in Dubai  it seems brand new  incredibly shiny and built on a larger scale than normal  The room was very comfortable but we struggled a bit to get the temperature right as the airconditioning was too powerful  The service was pleasant and we really enjoyed the breakfast blowout buffet which had a wider range of options than usual  The other part of the hotel we enjoyed was the pool area which gave this hotel  located minutes from the airport  a real resort feel  One night we ate at Awtar  the middle eastern restaurant which was superb  but beware   the portions are enormous  I d be happy to stay here again but Dubai is really rather soulless  so we wouldn t contemplate holiday here except when tied in to business  
N =>   fabulous  First time Dubai visitor    wasn t disappointing at all  We planned to stay at this property for   nights  but we had such a good time that we extended our stay for   more nights  The architecture is fabulous    restaurants are excellent even thought they are pricey  the lobby and hotel facilities are amazing  We make sure to use the outdoor pool everyday    the water is warm  clean and salty  Don t eat off the mini bar  it s just like any other   star hotel    pricey    don t rent a car from hotel Eurocar desk  they charge you at least   times than the real price out there  The concierge staffs are not the sharpest knives in the drawer         
N =>  Everyone was so friendly We usually shun large hotel chains  when having a holiday  I see enough of them through work   But The Grand Hyatt was a real surprise The room was very large and comfortable  we had a suite  so you expect that  but our son s room was very generous and well equiped  The food was  generally  of a very high standard  particularly the ket Cafe buffet breakfast  which set the day up very well But the real surprise was how friendly  polite and helpful everyone was  We were addressed by name  by people we don t think we had seen before  Ask directions for somewhere  and you were escorted to the appropriate place   All in all  we had a great long weekend at The Grand Hyatt  
N =>   Out of this world    Our first visit to Dubai and we were not disappointed  We were only there for   days on the way home from our honeymoon in the Maldives but the Grand Hyatt was fantastic  We had a Creek View room  much larger than the average sized hotel room and very comfortable with floor to ceiling windows to make the most of the view  The breakfast was amazing  I have never had such a large choice of food at such high standards  The staff were trained to a high level but still maintained a friendly atmosphere  There is nothing I hate more than a hotel I can t relax in        and I m glad to say this was not the case The pool area was fabulous  you would never know youe were in the middle of the city  The loungers were extremely comfortable and the waiters were always on hand to provide refreshments  A nice touch was the cold towels and cucumber for the eyes which were regularly handed out by the staff  It s these little extras that make a hotel special  The only downside that we could see was the price of food and drink in the hotel  Our second night there  we booked into the Manhattan grill for dinner  On arrival we were offered a table right at door or in the private dining area at the back  As we were on honeymoon we thought it would be nice to have the privacy of the private diningarea  But what we didn t know was that as the area was enclosed the air conditioning caused the room to be very cold  During our main course I mentioned this to the waiter who informed me that they could not alter the temperature without it effecting the whole hotel      We were not offered another table and eventually told them we would have to leave without dessert as the cold was unbearable to sit in any longer  I was very disappointed that we were not offered an alternative or given any apology by the manager  The food we did have was nice but I have had much better for much less money  It was such a shame as the breakfast is outstanding in both quality and service and I had high expectations for dinner  but we won t make that mistake again  To be honest I have the same opinion for the bar  Very expensive and on our next visit we will entertain ourselves outside of the hotel in the evenings  On the last night of our stay we went on a Dune Dinner Safari which was fantastic and excellent value for money  It included a thrilling  x   safari through the desert  stopping at a camp for camel rides  henna tattoos  belly dancing and food and drink  A great way to finish our holiday I would not think twice about staying at the Grand Hyatt again  It really was a fantastic hotel  well situated for the city  a fabulous pool area and very friendly staff  but if you want to eat dinner there  then be prepared to pay over the odds and don t forget to bring a woolly cardigan          
N =>   Lovely hotel with a bitter aftertaste This was my second visit to Dubai on a mixture of business and some holiday  amp  this hotel was booked for me by the seminar organisers  I was lucky enough to be staying in a Deluxe room  vast but soul less   which enabled me access to the Club lounge with its fantastic complementary breakfast and evening drinks plus buffet  The service was a little bit overkill  someone came to my room at least   times in one morning for fruit  towels  ice etc   but the facilities were excellent overall  I had a fabulous massage in the relaxing hotel spa and really enjoyed sitting in the huge atrium overlooking the palms and pools  and wandering round the landscaped grounds  However all this was a bit tainted for me by the attitudes of the some of the staff to a single younger woman traveller  I took care to dress carefully and conservatively but still felt I was being stared at when eating on my own  There was also one unpleasant incident on my last night  I returned to the hotel with my fellow colleagues who were all staying at the hotel  themselves GCC nationals  and was prevented from entering the lift by a man with a clipboard who demanded to know if I was the mistress of one of them as I wasn t a guest  Having shown him my room card  I was still treated like a hooker   weird considering I was wearing a business trouser suit and had not had a single alcoholic drink that night  After I complained  I was apologised to profusely but I felt that this man s attitude was really unacceptable and ruined the stay for me  
N =>  No Comparison Had the opportunity to spend two nights at The Grand Hyatt Dubai from     to      From Check in to Check out was an experience  The rooms are in immaculate condition and have all the luxury goods  The pool area was out of this world  It was like visiting a beach resort but in the middle of a city  I had the opportunity to try three differrent restaurants  All were top class  The breakfast at ket Cafe offerred a great variety of options  The stay was truly an memorable experience  My only regret is actually not spending more time at the hotel  
N =>  Lovely Hotel but     The grand Hyatt is a lovely hotel  no doubt  The only thing i have tofault it is the checking in process  It was a bit shaky  as we were told we had paid for only one night   as if       We had reservations for    but thank God we had a KUONI rep  who sorted it all out as it was the last lap of our honeymoon  The other thing was they asked if we wanted to upgrade our room to a creek view and we said yes  What ever you do  dont make the same mistake  You do see the creek  but its mile away  and Im sure the room without the creek view would have the same nice view  besides  we were hardly in the room to appreciate the so called view  That was a rip off That aside  We really liked the service  and friendliness of the staff at the Hyatt  Food was nice    lots of choice from all over the world  I do have to say that everything felt a bit  artificial   but then again  thats how i feel about Dubai having been there twice  Perhaps this is an unfair point seeing as we were just coming from Mauritius which is trully  Paradise  on earth  
N =>  grand hyatt Stayed ch      Fantastic hotel beautiful pool  amp  grounds  found the restaurant WOX not only good value but excellent  amp  authentic food Would we go back   In a blink  
N =>   What a disgrace  My family booked the Grand Hyatt as part of a stop over on the way back from Australia  We booked it over the internet through Ebookers because we thought that if we booked it early then we wouldn t have to worry about it when we get there  When we got there after a    hour flight everything was going well  We got a mini bus from the airport to the hotel and our bags got looked after  But  when we tried to check into our rooms problems started to occur  At first they claimed that we had rooms in the smoking section  when in fact we had booked   non smoking rooms  and when we said and showed them that we had booked non smoking rooms they said they had to juggle things about and then said that they had worked something out and were freshening up the rooms and while we waited we could have complimentary tea and coffee  But  when we enquired into when the rooms would be ready they started to claim that one of the rooms had not been paid for  when in fact it had been paid for   months previously  and asked that we should pay for the room again  Then they came back not long after and told us that both rooms had not been paid for  They also said that the card used to pay for the rooms was being refused which was rubbish and when we kept telling them that the rooms had already been paid for through the internet  they turned around and said that they tried to take the money out the previous night but had not been successful and that internet sites give you a confirmation when just booking a room without paying  which to us was rubbish because we had used the internet to pay for our hotels in Australia and they had been paid for and no internet site gives you a confirmation without payment   So in desperation we tried to call a family member in England to pay for the rooms using their credit card but the manager of the hotel told us that they needed the card to swipe and checks and told us that they could not accept a card number over the phone  My mother and father found that they were getting nowhere and was forced to opt to sleep in the airport overnight I think that this was all rubbish and my whole family believes that they didn t have any rooms available at all because they had overbooked plus they didn t want people like us sleeping in their hotel  But we are all agreed on the fact that we are never going back to Dubai or the Grand Hyatt Hotel again  
N =>   Honeymoon We stayed here for the first   days of our honeymoon before moving on to Mauritius for    days  see Beau Rivage  Mauritius  The Grand Hyatt was a great hotel  Good location  efficient service  Excellent selection of food for breakfast  ate far too much   This hotel is geared more to business than honeymooners but I have to say it was better than the last leg of our honeymoon  The staff were efficient  the room clean and tidy everytime we came back after the day  I cannot fault anything  I would recommend it  
N =>  Simply the best We  husband  me and    yr old son  stayed at the Grand Hyatt for   days in     en route to Thailand  and   days in     on the way back  We booked the hotel via Travelbag  who organised our whole trip  We were bowled over by not only the standards of service  but the whole layout of the hotel  Reception  lobby area is beautiful  Great to have an evening drink here  Pool area is fantastic for both kids and adults   no need to be near a beach  The kids pool is enormous and has water slides etc  There are so many lifeguards  who really do patrtol and keep an eye on all  Service by the pool was excellent   lots of fluffy white towels  fruit kebabs and cucumber slices for tired eyes  Plenty of sunbeds  shades available  They don t even let you put up your ownsun shade  Lunch from te pool bar was also very good   they actually set up a table for you next to your sunbeds  Conciege service was also very good   they organised a private jeep trip to the deset for us at a very competetive rate  We only stayed in a basic  grand  room  but it was more than big enough   bathroom has a stand alone shower as well as a bath  and two sinks  Tea  coffee facilities in the room  as well as a bowl of fruit and free mineral water  which is regularly replenished  Cleanliness of room was superb and they get a turn down service each night  Breakfast is amazing   we ate so much  we hardly needed lunch  The hotel is only about    mins from the airport but is in a great location to explore the rest of the city   i e  gold souk  Wild Wadi etc  Wild Wadi is a must   I usually hate such things  but it rates as the best water park I ve ever been to  Wafi City mall  lots of cheap places to eat in here  is also just a couple of minutes away  as is Wonderland and Planet Hollywood  We got taxi s everywhere   very cheap  quick and reliable  A couple of examples of how the staff go out of their way to please you   on our first day by the pool  our son scraped his toe and it was bleeding  Within a couple of minutes  a qualified first aider was attending to him  The head of security and then the hotel manager came out to the pool area to check if we were satisfied with the assistance we had received and whether we would like a hotel car to take our son to a Doctor or hospital  at no charge to us     and this was only a scraped toe  Also  on the flight back to Heathrow from Dubai  our son started crying as he had left his teddies in our room  We flew with Emirates  which has phones in every seat   we called the hotel from the plane   they informed us that they had already located his teddies and would send them back to our home address via DHL   they arrived within    hours of getting home  at no charge  Brilliant  Considering   star hotels in Dubai do tend to charge a lot for food  drinks  we thought the prices at the Hyatt were not too bad at all   similar to a   star in London  Prices at restaurants were considerably cheaper outside the hotel   we found a great Lebanese restaurant     courses for three of us came to approx       We visited other hotels on the beach  including Jumeirah Beach  to see what they were like and whether we should have stayed there   but no regrets at all  Jumeirah Beach hotel is great  but really  really busy   a bit like a posh Butlins  We have travelled all over the world and can honestly rate this hotel as the best we have ever stayed in  I would not hesitate to recommend it to all   old  young  singles  families  couples  We are in fact going back there on the   th     for a week   this time staying in the Emiri Suite  with club privileges  free transfers to and from airport  free breakfast in Club Lounge  free minibar  free soft drinks in the club lounge       including cocktails  alcohol and snacks between    pm   Got a great rate form Hyatt com   we have joined their Gold Passport scheme   well worth it  
N =>   Fantastic Return Stay This was our second stay at the Grand Hyatt  regular visitor to Dubai  and like the first time we were not disappointed  The standard of the Hotel was absolutely  st class and all areas looked like they were to  st week opening standard  As a reader of Trip Advisor  i did read some concerning comments about this Hotel in recent Months  I can say that whilst i have no reason to disbelieve anyone who wrote them  we certainly encountered nothing but the best standard of service  Last two trips to Dubai prior to this were both Jumeirah Beach Hotel stays and in my estimation the Grand Hyatt compares well  Would have no hesitation in either returning or recommending to friends  As an aside a Family member also staying in this Hotel on his  st visit to Dubai and has equally positive comments as myself  His return to Dubai would almost certainly include a stay the the Grand Hyatt again  
N => Really Good Hotel We went to Dubai on the   th of ch for a break and have to say that we found this hotel to be very good  The service that we experianced went beyond that which we had expected after reading some of the reports on this site  The Hotel itself is probably the biggest in Dubai We arrived late after a long flight and followed the instructions given to go to the desk and hand the taxi voucher to them  We were soon in a taxi and on our way to the hotel  It didnt take that long to get there but then again the traffic was light When we got to the hotel the staff were quick to help unload the taxi and then the front desk dealt with us promptly  Up to our room and the bellboy brought our luggage soon after The hotel is very clean and laid out internally in a superb manner  Very posh and very modern  The staff were as you would expect from a five star hotel very unobtrusive but there when ever any need was anticipated  My Wife spent time out by the pool and she stated that she had never been treated with such attention at any resort that she had been at before  cucumber for the eyes  cooling spray  nothing was too much trouble  Attracting the attention of staff was never an issue and food and drink orders were dealt with promptly All in all it was a great hotel  We ate at the Manhattan Grill and the italian and found both of them to give good service and great food  The coffee shop had delicious ice cream and also served great coffee Dubai was a good destination to go to and enjoyed the souks  the taxis were cheap   in fact very cheap by western standards  We did the river cruise and also went to the Basra Arab    for afternoon tea in the observation room   that was excellent but I have to say that I was most disappointed with the service  this was supposedly a high class resort but to recieve a cracked cup beggered belief I would not hesitate to return to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone  
N => Excellent Hotel My wife  amp  I stayed at the Grand Hyatt from  st to  th il We thought the hotel was excellent in virtually every category We had a Grand Creek room which was large  amp  very comfortable  We dined in both the Manhattan Grill  amp  Atwa  amp  found the standard of food and service to be first class We arrived at   am off the early Virgin flight  amp  were very pleased to be able to check in immediately The only mild irritation was to have to wait    minutes  amp  make   calls before having our luggage collected from our room for departure Away from the hotel shopping was great but although warned we were still amazed at the amount of construction going on If you get the opportunity try Verre by Ramsay at the Hilton Dubai Creek   absolutely terrific  
Nice hotel  equally nice options exist This hotel is quite lovely  especially the swimming pool and it has an extensive array of food options  However  it is quite isolated  which means that one must rely quite exclusively on the services provided by the hotel  Taxis in Dubai are relatively inexpensive  so it is easy and cheap to get around to other places  It may also be helpful to note that in Dubai  the alcohol is sold only at hotel bars and in some restaurants  licensed restaurants   Another Hyatt  the Park Hyatt Dubai  has recently opened near the Dubai ina  which is trendy  modern and gorgeous  We went there just to eat  and it was absolutely spectacular  The Park Hyatt is more centrally located  and it seems to be about the same price as the Grand Hyatt  
N =>  OUT OF THIS WORLD   I took my Girlfriend to dubai for her   st Birthday  have been to dubai   times and stayed in a number of different hotels  nothing seems to compare to the grand hyatt   we had a creek room and the view was amazing they gave her fresh flowers everyday  and we even got a b day cake   and we were treated like a king and a queen  the hotel was very luxury and the staff were very polite  it was ramadam but it didnt bother us  still lots to doyou have to eat in pepper crab and have some seafood  and ask the chefs to do a flambe  cant wait to go back  a true amazing place        
N =>   Not a good choice for an enjoyable trip Having gone to Dubai for the first time on a business trip  I was rather disappointed by the hotel  The airport pickup failed to materialise and I had to take a taxi after a ten hour flight  My supposedly superior room was located on the first floor with a view of the airport and of a big sign advertising IKEA  The decor throughout the hotel was extremely kitschy and it lacked atmosphere  Having stayed in a lot of   star hotels  I can honestly say that the Grand Hyatt Dubai was the worst so far The only positive aspect of the hotel was the food  room service  which was up to the highest standards  although the staff made it very obvious that they expect a tip   
N => Rolls Royce Hotel Reliant Robin Service Earlier reviews of this hotel on trip advisor indicated serious problems regarding service but my father s recent visit in y      to the Grand Hyatt Dubai did not confirm any of these common concerns  Hence we decided to visit in mid       for a   night stay  reserving a non smoking creek view room for a family of   The type of service we could expect was obvious right from the start of the holiday  when the airport transfer limousine that we booked and confirmed by email in advance was delayed by over    mins and we were made to wait in the heat with   young children  The incompetence of the concierge was even more apparent when a   series BMW came to pick up a family of four   the boot was only able to take one large suitcase and not the three we bought along  Finally a Landcruiser was sent to handle the additional luggage  Daniela in concierge apologised with some reservations for the mix up and offered to waive the airport transfer fees worthy of a measly     pounds sterling   hardly befitting the trouble caused and certainly not the best way to make a good impression on new customers  Inside the hotel  the main foyer is quite spectacular with a pineapple  amp  palm tree chandelier hanging over the Al Nakeel lounge and sea boats appearing in the backdrop  A comprehensive selection of restaurants is centred on a rain forest theme with a stream of exotic fish Following check in with a confused member of the front desk  we were left to search for our own room while the bellboys followed after  a lost opportunity in my opinion to welcome the guests to Dubai and sell the fabulous restaurants and facilities of the hotel  After discovering that our dedicated room was actually a designated smoking room  we rang the customer services manager  Girish  Luckily he spoke English very well and could understand our concerns to swiftly move us to a  th floor non smoking room The creek view room itself was very elegantly furnished and a very good size even by Dubai standards with spectacular views over the creek and resort pools  Air conditioning system was very effective and although the fridge was one of those  quot Touch anything and you re charged quot   you had the option of getting this emptied by house keeping  The room featured a day lounger and a comfortable king sized bed with good quality pillows and linen  Just a small reminder for UK guests to bring your own tea bags  theirs certainly don t come close to PG tips  The large bathrooms at the hotel are very impressively finished a contemporary mosaic finish  you have twin washbasins  a designer bathtub  a power shower cubicle and segregated w c  amp  bidet  Just needed Molten Brown products to finish off the overall experience expected at a top    hotel in Dubai As we were visiting during the Ramadan period certain restrictions were in place at this hotel  drinking and eating was limited to certain confined areas  Quite bizarre as the Dubai beach hotels are a lot more liberal on these restrictions and only ban serving alcohol until  pm  When visiting the dedicated enclosure at the pool resort  service to take our order and bring out the drinks and snacks was embarrassingly slow  When you look at the prices they charge against the service and products delivered  the feeling of  day light robbery  certainly comes to mind  We were expecting the room service menu to be extended for the Ramadan period as so many of the restaurants are closed  but yet again another lucrative opportunity was missed  Room service was very inflexible and often bordering on rude  certainly not proactive to guiding customer selection or to recommend the availability of foods at the market caf   Service in the restaurants is much the same  they all are well trained and happy to say no and look the other way We did find some hidden gems at this hotel  the ice creams in the Italian Caf   Panini and the hot stone massage at the Grand Spa  I suspect the root cause of the service failures at this hotel  starts with the management  I do not believe they value  appreciate or even appropriately reward the hotel staffs  who are in turn disenfranchised by this negative culture  The management are very happy to listen to customer complaints but taking corrective action is not something they are empowered to do  Would we ever stay at this hotel ever again    certainly not while we have the choice of our favourites in Dubai  Le Royal Meridien and Grosvenor House  which continue to raise the royal service standards in Dubai  
N =>  Very poor staff attitude After having spent   night at a hotel we will never ever return to  absolutely no value for money   we decided to move to the Hyatt thinking we would feel at home considering I ve previously worked at several Hyatt hotels myself We were disappointed from check in where we had to wait several minutes although there were   front office staff behind the glass wall chatting Once in the room we felt very comfortable  the room was spotless and I d rate the room     Well  the feeling didn t last too long as we met some of the most unfriendliest staff as we walked through the hotel  We went to Panini   times  and only ONE female staff welcomed us with a smile  all of the many other staff couldn t care less  No smile  no eye contact when answering our question  rude  just extremely unpleasant  Also  the waiter at the Italian restaurant served us throughout dinner with no smile  just a cold facial expression  no hospitality whatsoever  The Concierge staff also answered our questions with no smile and no eye contact  The only pleasant staff we met were probably the bell staff  Upon check out we left a letter to the GM stating they should definitely improve their staff attitude  especially as I know what Hyatt s standard is supposed to be  We got a call from a Front Office staff  Manager    saying they actually receive a lot of comments regarding their staff  but that they are too busy to actually work on it  Very poor management I d say  service personal experiences are the most important issues in hotel  not how grand the hotel  looks   If you want to stay at a beautiful hotel near the airport  stay at this hotel  but do not expect to served from friendly staff  
N =>  Excellent This hotel cannot be faulted  We upgraded to a Creek view room which was spacious had everything we needed  Facilities fantastic   you wouldn t know you were in the city   no traffic noise no building work  check out the spa  its amazing  Service spot on  lots of choices to eat but typical Dubai hotel prices and you can get good food a lot cheaper  Only    mins from most of the city attractions and malls  Definately recommended  can t wait to go back  
N => Have to agree with comments about staff  
N =>  Not sure  
N => Very bad service   throughout the hotel  
N => a good    hotel  
N =>  We were spoilt rotten     
N =>  wonderfull experience  
N =>   Don t go to the Grill restaurant  
N =>  Hyatt Gold Passport Fails to Deliver On a recent business trip to Grand Hyatt Dubai  had one of those experiences  where you can t but feel rather taken advantage of by the hotel group As a regular Hyatt guest  I hold a Platinum level  Hyatt Gold Passport   which it says everywhere that  entitles me to a  Guaranteed Room within    hours  However  don t be fooled by this  value promis  It turns out  that  room  in this casem  was either a suite at a whopping   times normal room rate  or the Presidential Suite  at    times the normal room rate As a    year Hyatt veteran  how could one NOT feel shortchanged  and taken for a ride Needless to say  the GP  Gold Passport  phone staff  based out of  seemingly somewhere near Timbuktu  were of no help  showed no desire to resolve this situation  nor appeared to possess an emphathetic bone in their body However  I would recommend the Westin Mine Seyahi at the Jumeriah Beach Resort as a nice alternative to the Hyatts in Dubai    
N =>   Dubai s a shopper s paradise well we had booked the second best room in the hotel and we got special access to a lounge on the top floor of the hotel   that was just amazing   we could see the palm islands    they were under construction   but mostly complete    it was just amazing   the staff was also very helpful 
N =>   Chose to Return I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for over a week in the summer of      and was so impressed that I returned in uary      for a   night stay  The facilities are impressive with several restaurants that serve great food and good service  in the USA  we tend not to eat in hotel restaurants because the food quality is not comparable to nonhotel restaurants but this is not the case in most of Dubai  In the summer  they offer discounts to guests who dine at their in house restaurants  but this was not the case in Dubai  The location of the hotel is about    minutes from the airport and you have easy access to the main north south artery to Jumeirah  Please note that in Dubai  most people  including tourists  do not walk anywhere unless they have to so although the Grand Hyatt is not in the thick of things  we did not find this to be an impediment  If you would rather be within walking distance of the old city  you may want to stay in Deira  keep in mind though that the traffic is really bad in that part of the city and getting elsewhere will take longer  Pros  large  nicely appointed rooms  high standard of cleanliness  good restaurants  and wonderful spa gym and indoor pool  as well as outdoor pools Cons  occasional mischarges on the bill that are corrected when brought to their attention and high internet access fees  
N =>   Excellent Staff and good hotel Every thing was great   when you check in try to ask the staff to give you room in the high floor   it was great   the staff was friendly   the rooms were clean and they didn t let us wait long for our rooms when we checked in I liked to extend my accomadation for longer time  but unfortunatellty I could not  amp  I must return back to my job as soon as possible  
N => Hotel that likes to sell NO Breakfast was terrible  almost like having it at gasstation  Service was bad  they did not provide any shirt pressing service  Front desk had no manners  they would always start to do something else or talk to anyone else when I was talking to them about anything  
N =>   In a word  Dreary Spent five days looking at a slate gray wall next to the hotel  Couldn t see the sky or the street  Probably good because if the room was too lit up I d notice more flaws in the construction  The hotel looks like it was built slap dash  Tiles don t match  projects looks like they were started and changed in mid construction  Lighting is not sufficient for the high ceilings  Furniture shows visible signs of wear  Ate breakfasts and one dinner in the restaurant  Not bad  but I m not a fussy eater  Might be for someone else  Staff was nice enough  given what they had to work with  
Not the best in Dubai I stayed there for a week   I was supposed to have an aiport pick up but couldn t find the driver    when I arrived at the hotel i was charged for the   hours parking the driver had to wait at the airport   The reception staff are not the friendliest   The room was okay but make sure you put the water heater on    st day had no shampoo or shower gel provided so make sure you get your own The fridge is totally empty   The breakfast buffet was very poor too   The only good thing in the hotel is that it s a walking distance from Burjuman Center 
Not as good as it used to be I was at this hotel for a month and in general it wasn t bad  but it has gone downhill the last few years from what I can tell  It is impressive when you first walk in  but as you settle down  you do notice some of the sofas are stained and after a while you do start to feel a general shabbiness to the place  Having said that  it has everything you need  adjustable air con  a TV  huge cooker oven  gigantic bosch fridge  lots of cupboard space  DVD player and a free electronic safety deposit box  The gas stove and the oven don t work though which was a bit disappointing  plus the channels weren t always clear   the staff fixed this for me a few times  and the DVD player didn t work either     also my bathroom taps seemed to have two settings hot and hotter   The breakfast was a buffet  mainly indian food  it was ok but a bit of a rip off for   dhs  especially since there are so many supermarkets in that area   Families  across the road then Spinneys my favourite   and Choitrams just a       min away I used the gym everyday and it had all the basics two treadmills  a crosstrainer  two bikes  and basic weightlifting equipment  It was often empty but I was there in the summer so maybe that s why  Swimming pool was a bit on the small side  not for serious swimmers and it can get quite full  if you go during the day but I was thankful not to see it filled with concrete as some other reviews suggested All the plug sockets are English but for some strange reason the hotel staff plug european plugs into English sockets  like the iron for example and there was a bit of a spark when you unplugged it  The only real issues I had with the place was my phone  it was faulty and would ring in the middle of the night for no reason  even after staff had fixed it several times also the cleaners didn t clean the rooms very well  But the location is good  and don t worry about taxi drivers not finding it  they don t seem to know most places  Plus all you need to do is pick up a hotel card and pay attention when you arrive  The hotel organises airport pick up which is   dhs  a taxi would cost you maybe    max  Internet costs   dhs an hour or     for the month The hotel itself is good  location etc   and the rooms are huge but the extras  e g breakfast  internet  airport pick up are expensive and best avoided Oh here s a tip  the laundry guy comes at  am every morning to ask if you need laundry done  if you want a lie in  stick the do not disturb sign outside the door the night before to avoid being woken up  
N =>   four star hotel i think not me and my husband have just returned from our  honeymoon  staying at the grand midwest hotel  It wasnt chosen by us but was booked through my brother in law as wedding gift  Upon arrival at     am our bags were loaded onto the trolley immediately and were seen to by a very kind gentlemen i think the manager   We were upgraded without charge to a deluxe apartment as there were no standard rooms available  Throughout our stay the bathroom was cleaned everyday and toiletries stocked full however the bath needed replacing as it was very chipped  The rooms were tidied everyday without fail and very spacious The swimming pool is NOT WORKING they will fail to tell you this little piece of info as we found out the hard way when we checked on the pool on the roof nothing but rubble up there  The breakfast was not to our taste though all food was labeled for all foreign guests and not much a variety which they can do with  We found all male staff to be very helpful esp RAM the females MOSTLY will fob you off with incorrect info They have cards to give to taxis drivers to locate the hotel easily This hotel is advertsing as   star however we experienced a   star hotel  
N =>   Pleasantly surprised Having read a very negative review of Grand Midwest Hotel Apartments in Dubai on TripAdvisor before we went on holiday  I was a bit anxious about what we would find  We spent a week there on a family holiday in ember and we found the apartment to be very spacious  clean  well serviced with very helpful staff  The small restaurant was just as advertised but the standard of accomodation and location in the city more than made up for that  This was not a    luxury hotel apartment  but reasonably priced  generously sized accommodation ideal for a family at a particularly busy time of year over Christmas  
Not bad for a short stay This accommodation was paid for by my employer  which was across the road  so the convenience slightly outweighed the cons First impressions were it was really flash   great shower bath spa facility  a double and single bed and plenty of space However after a few nights  it began to sink in There was no kitchen sink in my room so I needed to wash dishes in the bathroom  other rooms have them though  and despite there being a single element to cook on  there were no pots  pans or cooking utensils  There was a washer dryer combo  but there was no where to actually hang washing  I avoid dryers for delicates   There is a laundry service  but if you are staying for   weeks  you don t want to be paying for laundry services all the time My room did have a TV with cable and a variety of English  Indian and Arabic news  entertainment and sports channels  incl  BBC  CNN and ESPN Across the road is a reasonably well stocked  but untidy  mini market  a pharmacy and down the road is the widely well know Burjaman shopping complex The house keeping service was good  there was a gym and pool on the top floor  The in house restaurant left a lot to be desired  as did the  quot    hour business centre quot  which was two PCs which you could only surf the web on  no word  excel etc    Most of the hotel staff were very pleasant though there was at least one gentlemen who treated me very poorly on my arrival   I was dishelved and messy but I had just gotten off of a   hour flight and not slept for    hours All in all  this place is ok to stay in if you are in Dubai for a short time  My room at least was not suitable for long term accommodation as it lacked alot of the amenities required for it to be operational  
N =>   My worst enemy is the only one I would recommend to stay here  Horrendous is the only word to describe my experience  I arrived at around   a m  from Qatar  was shown to my pre booked and confirmed  non smoking  room which stunk of cigarretes and had an ashtray and matches  After unpacking and preparing for bed I threw back the covers on the bed to find filthy pillowcases  hair and marks all over the sheets  I threw back the covers on the second bed to find the same  On calling reception they sent someone from housekeeping to change the sheets  Whilst waiting I looked around the  kitchen   There were no glasses and some cutlery was missing  I was supposed to acknowledge that these were all there  I asked to change rooms and was shown one just as bad  if not dirtier  I decided to return to the original room  Eventrually I got to bed around   a m  to wake up at   for an early appointment  Breakfast was bizarre  The tables were not set correctly and I had to go around other tables to collect knife  spoon  serviettes etc  There were around   silver  heated  turines containing liquids with lumps in  most of which were not known to me  I chose to have what appeared tro be scrambled egg  I located brown bread for toasting which  by texture and brittleness  appeared to have already been toasted  It had not and was merely old  I switched to the white which may have been this years  I can only assume that the orange juice was called this because of the colour  That was the only resemblance to an orange  It transpired the scrambled eggs were cold  I left the food and went to a loal cafe for breakfast  I didnt eat in the MidWest again  Later that day after returning from work I decided to have a look around the room  They claim the suites are new  If this is the case then they used a mould accelerator on the tile grout in the bathroom  The bath was badly chipped as was the tiled floor  On my penultimate day there they took out the TV whilst I was out and replaced it with one that did not work  This was never explained  despite being asked to say why  No compensation was offered or even an explanation  I strongly recommend that this hotel is avoided  whatever the cost  
Not luxury hotel apartments This is definitely not a luxury hotel apartment  as the website claims it to be  The pictures must be modified bcs  could not see how they have taken them from any camera angle  The rooms are big but there is not a lot of furniture  The furniture which there is  is old and the sofa in the   bedroom apartment we stayed in was the dirtiest I have ever seen  The swimming pool area was closed so can not rate it  Location quite bad  go for Deira unless you are interested in buying luxury shopping items in Bur Juman Shopping centre close to the hotel for prices much higher than in Europe or US  Room service has only flotty fatty fried things which are not worth the money  I would rate this as a   star hotel  and considering that they are marketing themselves as a luxury hotel apartment  I was disappointed  You can by the way get this hotel for half the price they are offering at the airport  just after baggage collection there is a great counter selling hotel rooms in Dubai at DXB airport   
N =>   stay in dubai pretty good hotel   we got an upgrade to a nice suitereasonable price 
N =>   Long way to go for a   star hotel Good news   personal service was very good   need to get their act together though with concierge services  We ended up paying taxi that they called for us which was the hotel s mistake  Room was satisfactoriy kept clean   but only one chocolate for   people  Restaurant food was ver good  Will recommend for short stay Bad news   for a   star hotel   room was mediocre  Curtains were ill fitting with poor hardware   even roadside motels in the US have better curtains  Wallpaper were poorly done  Closet doors were also poorly built  the mirror fell off and broke into thousands of pieces  after the trim fell off  Wonder what else would fall down in the future  The shower cover on the tub did nothing to stop water from spilling over  The art work were cheap and poorly hung  Services written on binder does not match current restaurant services  No amenities close by due construction site  plus construction noise early in the morning is disconcerting  
N =>   Good the hotel rooms were good  good food  good price  
N =>   not a   star hotel I am not sure how they determine the number of stars for the hotels but if jumeriah beach hotel is   star this hotel should be no more than   star  pool area absolutly useless  lobby is very small compare to other    hotels  There is no place in hotel to hang out at night time  staffs not very frndly except couple of them      overall this hotel ruined my vaccation  wouldnt stay there any more  
N =>  habtoor just back went to the habtoor grand for easter  did not think it very grand  the room we had said views we had a wall very dark the bed was very very uncomfortable to and the food was expensive and not very good cold  rooms ok but not          we ask for other room but they said they had none so all we had to look at was the wall nice we stayed at the jumeriah beach hotel last time superb that is         great rooms lovely views of the lovely beach and of the burj al arab food great very good price wise to dinner on   th floor views of dubai great people very helpful and nice will def stay there next time 
N => could do better we recently returned after   days at the habtoor it did not start off to well as the transport we had arranged thru hotel never showed up so we had to get a taxi from airport to hotel we had booked a tower room which was terrific but i had to go to reception      in morning to ask if workmen could stop hammering and drilling in the lobby area as we could not sleep it seems a lot of staff are not english speaking so some problems making myself understood we did not mind the construction going on around the hotel as u are on the beach it is all going on behind u service in the main was ok i would advise any one booking this hotel to go for the tower rooms as the garden rooms tho near the pool are much older so appear a bit shabby i was told by staff that some of these rooms were being remodeled also the hotel has been open a number of months so it may be it needs time to settle 
N => Service not up to it As a previous reviewer states  the staff were surly and generally unhelpful  I will just catalog my experience and let you make up your own mind When we checked in we had a voucher and had paid in full to our agent Emirates Tours  However  for some reason our booking was not in the hotel computer  The staff  were not particularly helpful at resolving our plight and at times were quite dismissive We wanted to go to Arab Al Burj  the self proclaimed seven star hotel   I asked the concierge if he could book us a table  He said that he would try  when I went back to him an hour later he said that he had tried but that it was not possible  I then went up to my room picked up the phone and booked a table myself  He clearly hadn t even tried Our return flight was early in the morning so I paid our extras bill at      am when we returned from our evening out  I was asked if I had used the minibar and replied that I had not used the minibar at all  I paid the bill by credit card and we went up to bed  At     am a member of staff repeatedly knocked on our door to check the minibar even though I had just told him that I hadn t used it  they had my credit card anyway  The gym is good  the food in the restaurants was very overpriced  the pool sunloungers are all gone by     am and no  the service is not five star quality  Try the Royal Meridien next door  
N =>  Lovely Hotel I have just returned from staying at the Habtoor in Dubai  I d read alot of mixed reviews before going and decided not to make up my mind until I got there although I have to admit I was expecting the worst  We got there mid morning and unfortunatley their computer system had gone down so we were asked to wait in the lobby  The wait wasn t long and we were called to check in  We asked for a  free upgrade  and were surprised when they escorted us to the  club check in desk   We were upgraded to a beautiful club room which was spacious and great as we had two small children  The staff were really helpful and friendly  There were the odd niggles like my husband getting locked in the bathroom due to a faulty door lock and there not being a cover on one of the electric sockets  but these were fixed within half an hour of reporting them  It was my husbands birthday on the day we arrived and when we returned from the Mall that evening  we were surprised to find a huge birthday cake in our room  Nobody had mentioned a thing and we did at first think they had put the cake in the wrong room   All the staff were really nice and really helpful  The food in the hotel was lovely and the premises was very clean  I would definitley recommend this hotel  
N =>  Very Good Hotel Again  like previous travellers  I was worried after seeing previous negative reviews  However  I would have absolutely NO hesitation to recomend this Hotel  Staff were very friendly and efficient  Hotel was very clean and the food in ALL the restaraunts was excellent  We stayed for    nights at the hotel and dined in the hotel for   of these  Like other travellers  I would comment that the restaurants were very quiet in the evenings  but this might be due to the fact that the majority of the guests were Russian and seemed not to eat out in the evening  The food was quite expensive  but it was  quot good quot  restaurant standard  We stayed in a Grand Club Room which was spotlessley clean and maintained  The Grand Club Roooms also had the added benefit of the  quot Grand Club quot  which provided complimentary breakfast  afternoon tea  and pre dinner canapes and cocktails  In my view  worth the extra  There was a lot of contruction work around the hotel  but this did not affect our holiday  However  if you are worried about contruction then Dubai is definately the wrong venue  In short  if you have already booked a holiday here or are planning to do so  I would have abslutely NO regrets  
N => would not go there again  
N =>  Poor hotel   do not stay here unless desperate  
N =>  Worst hotel we ve stayed in our life   
N =>  Das war das was man von einem  sternen Hotel erwartet  
N =>   hotel ottimo per vacanza balneare  
N =>  Appalling experience As someone who travels frequently on business and most often to the UAE I often consult Trip Advisor prior to booking a hotel that I don t know  This was the case with the Hallmark as it was a last minute booking and few hotels were available due to a computer expo  Firstly  this hotel is located in a dusty backstreet of Deira  the old Dubai and is practically impossible to find  My contact there has lived in Dubai since      and had never heard of it   nor had any taxi driver  On arrival I could see why  It is two or three stars at a push and yet cost the price of the Al Murooj Rotana  a superb   star   Even though we arrived a day late due to flight delays they refused to deduct a night s room tariff even though our room had been rented to someone else and we had to wait for it to be cleaned The rooms were shabby  I had to move within   minutes due to the noise of nearby building works  But the thing that really finished it for me was that  in    degrees celsius of heat and     humidity  there was NO cold running water  At all  None  Zilch  Seeing as how the water temperature was so hot that I could only wash my hair by diving in and out at half second intervals it was practically impossible to wash   not ideal in such a climate  On reporting the problem to reception I was told that there was nothing they could do To top it off the rooftop pool was tiny   impossible to cool off there Another issue which is admittedly not their fault  the Hallmark s location in the middle of crowded Deira  means that it feels substantially hotter than downtown Bur Dubai or Jumeirah  A local told me this too  Finally  and again  not their fault  and a point to remember if you re new to Dubai  is that the traffic in Deira is atrocious  This means that if you want to go to the beach mall anywhere be prepared for a long trip  It took us   hour and    mins to get to the Mall of the Emirates In short  after day two I couldn t hack it any more and checked into the Al Murooj Rotana  which was booked out when we arrived  and breathed a deep sigh of relief I ve never written a negative review of any hotel before but I feel that Trip Advisor readers deserve to get an honest opinion  If you re on business in Dubai please try the Al Murooj Rotana     mins to the beach or the Mall  or the Movenpick  Much better value than the Hallmark  Otherwise head to Jumeirah  For similar cash I hear the Habtoor Grand is great  Hope this helps  
N =>   hellhole After reading the reviews on the Hallmark hotel  I decided that this was the hotel for myself and my family to stay at for a enjoyable holiday On our arrival after a long tiring journey from England we started to experience the hotels bad service we arrived at     m and was not offered our rooms until      am We werent offered any refreshments only advice to look around the streets  as if we needed this after our journey but we had no other choice   When we were finally shown our rooms they were both single rooms  we complained that this was unacceptable as we had booked doubles their response was carefree with no consideration to try and sort this out immediately We were then offered to stay in these rooms as no other room would be ready until      hrs  we agreed to this but ended up staying in these rooms for our whole    days as nothing ever got sorted out  The hotels rating states a  star as it has been recently refurbished  this is not the case  our stay involved us having to accomodate around the on going work night and day We didnt use the coffee shop due the dust and noise of workmen in the reception and during the evening you would need a mask if you ventured downstairs as they were using sray paint  The hotel reception staff sat behind their desks of a evening with the doors open all masked up  so this meant the downstairs coffee lounge was out of use unless you wanted to sit amongst this The bathrooms were of a decent size but sorry to say I wish the hygiene was to  We reported this and they sent a maintenance man up with the cleaner to inspect the black mould that was growing around the bath We also pointed out that the light switch on the head board had loose live wires hanging out and the window had a broken handle and was held in by one screw Wallpaper was ripped and it looked if as someone had had their dirty feet on the wall and the air conditioning unit was constantly leaking The reponse was the hotel was in the process of being refurbished and it will look lovely when its all finished but for now there was nothing they could do You could imagine our anger as this was no use to us  we had paid for a   stat hotel no compensation or even to change our rooms was offered  they said the hotels manager would get back to us and we handed them the completed guest service form By the time our holiday had come to an end no one got back to us  we are so relieved to be home to get some sleep as I must also mention that there constant building work going on at the back of the hotel  looks as if a another hotel is to be errected   this kept my children awake due the   hrs generators running  My advice is check it all out before you book  
N =>   Great hotel My wife and I stayed just the one night  we wanted a relaxing time and certainly got that  From the welcoming fruit cocktail to the adult only pool it was great  Staff could not do enough for you  they were genuinely friendly interested in you and not what tip they could get  We will be back and will stay longer next time  
N =>   Exotic Oasis Such an unexpected pleasure  The service in the Restaurant was over and above  We felt like VIPs  Our room was extremely spacious  The only downside was the walk from our airconditioned room to the Restaurant  It was extremely warm at about    degrees  
N =>   surprisingly GOOD restaurant  We spent two nights here with one five year old  The hotel was quite a pleasant surprise on most counts  Especially the Jeema restaurant  we did not expect to find a sophisticated kitchen in the middle of nowhere  Great food and great presentation  also very good service  We have been to far more expensive restaurants in Dubai and been quite unhappy with the food  My guess is that chef Savio     is treated with great care    There is live music  but the musicians are nowhere as good as the chef  The rooms and bathrooms are good  was surprised to read later that the hotel was    years old  The rooms look quite contemporary and the bathrooms are clean and quite modern  We were given an extra bed for our daughter at no extra cost  we didnt actually ask for it  but it was good to have The miniature golf was interesting  and the pools were good too  we did not try out any other activity  
N =>   Great service  My partner and I stayed at Hatta in ober seeking a break away from the heat and hectic life of Dubai  We chose Hatta as the website promoted a number of activities available including spa treatments  off roading  shooting and archery  Unfortunately we found the spa to be closed   long term due to sickness and the off roading we were told was not available due to the area needing to be cleaned  We thought this was strange as we were in the midst of the Hajar mountain range so surely there would be more than one trail used by the off road driving company  Even more strange was the number of off road driving companies that use the hotel as a stop for a BBQ lunch   surely off roading could have been organised The archery area was not particularly well maintained and the targets were in need of replacing A walk around to the shooting area showed that this area was also in need of some care and attention  Had we known there would be such a lack of and poor facilities we may possibly have chosen a different destination On a more positive note the rooms appeared to be recently refurbished and were very comfortable and the bathroom was a very good size with lovely bath and walk in shower  The swimming pool area  there are two   we chose the quiet pool  was pleasant  clean and well attended  The food was of a high standard and above all the service was excellent   the staff could not have been more pleasant  helpful and willing to please All in all a nice but slightly dated hotel lacking in activites but with great staff  
N =>   Loved Hatta We have just returned from Hatta Fort having stayed there for   nights  What can I say  in all of our extensive travelling we have never stayed anywhere where we were made to feel so pampered and special Nothing was too much trouble for the staff  the room was immaculate and the food superb  There was lots to do if the mood took  equally there was total relaxation  We will definately be back C and J Reid 
N =>  Relaxing break in a little oasis We ve stayed at Hatta Fort twice in the last month  taking advantage of their mid week specials which include dinner and breakfast  The rooms are large and have their own balcony and the grounds are very nice to wander around  admiring the aviary and the wandering peacocks  We spent most of our days just lazing by the pool and enjoying the afternoon breeze  As it was midweek the hotel was very quiet and our stay was relaxing Having read in previous reviews and a guidebook of the terrible food here we were hesitant staying here at all as we really didn t want to be a captive market for awful meals  We were very pleasantly surprised to find the food was good  During our first visit the evening meal was a buffet  the second it was a la carte  Both were very enjoyable  in fact the vegetarian dish I had from the menuI was exceptionally nice  We really have no complaints about the hotel  staff can be a little slow to get things done but we were in no hurry anyway  They were certainly always very polite and helpful  
N =>  would recommend this hotel i really liked this hotel  we had a refurbished mountain view room which was really lovely like a little swiss chalet  nicely decorated huge bed  balcony  beautuiful big bathroom  make sure you ask for a refurbished room is def worth the extra money  the service was great very attentive almost too attentive especially at the buffet where they kept taking to plate from us to carry to the table  even the singers in the restaurant were good and i usually hate that sort of thing  drinks by the pool were a bit expensive   coffees and   juices were     which seemed a bit excessive  there was a pool just for adults which was great the kids pool is on the other side of the hotel  the actual hotel is a bit dated but not run down or shabby just old fashion  a great hotel would recommend and our dinner was included in the rate so it was good value for money too  
N =>  Very disappointing We booked to stay at Hatta Fort after reading the great reviews on this site  We got married whilst in Dubai  and wanted to spend a few days away from the hustle and bustle of Dubai I have to say we weren t impressed  The hotel reminded me of a British traditional holiday resort   a bit shabby around the edges  old fashioned decor etcThe rock pool was closed  and the residents pool was unbearably cold  and the golf course was shut  All in all we were just really disappointed  The grounds are very pretty  but when we arrived there was a big corporate event on  so relaxing on the balcony was accompanied by tug of war etc etc This was a very low price resort  and we hoped for a little gem  but after the luxury of Dubai it was really disappointing We checked out after   night and went to Bab al Shams instead which was great  
N => Curried favour IMy husband and I spent   nights at the Hatta Fort  on a B  amp  B basis  in tember       We had a wonderful time   the hotel was excellent in every respect  Nothing was too much trouble  The swimming pools were lovely and  as we also went out of season     people around the pool constituted  rush hour   The rooms were large  well maintained and contained everything necessary for an enjoyable stay  The staff were friendly and helpful Unlike the previous reviewer we didn t try the desert golf  the mini golf was more our style   but we had great fun on the Archery range   which was free  Tuition  if required  is extra but very very inexpensive Not far from the hotel main gates we found a Lebanese    restaurant which was extremely cheap  We couldn t name all the dishes on our table but the experience proved well worth the visit When we expressed a wish to visit the nearby Heritage Village   too hot and too far to walk  the hotel provided a car  amp  driver free of charge  The driver dropped us off and arranged to collect us when we wished The hotel restaurant  in common with all those in other first class hotels  is expensive but my husband said the curry was the best he had ever tasted   anywhere         including Asia The hotel manager came to speak to us before we left and asked if we had enjoyed our stay   not something that happens very often  It s the little things which make you feel just that tiny bit special We intend to return next year to celebrate our wedding anniversary Sue Goodwin 
N => Pleasantly Surprised  We stayed at this hotel for   nights as a stopover coming back to Scotland from Mauritius  Having read some of the previous reports I was a little concerned  However all we wanted was somewhere fairly reasonably priced close to the airport We arrived at the hotel at  am  Although check in isn t until  pm we were given our room by  am  When we entered the room we thought there was some mistake  Seems we were upgraded to an  Executive Suite    not bad for     a night  We had a dining room lounge and seperate bedroom with seating area and two bathrooms  It was a pity we weren t staying longer to make the most of it  The room was very clean  We were on the corner of the main Al Rigga Road and although you could hear some noise  it didn t keep us awake  We also didn t hear any aircraft noice apart from the odd helicopter  Coming from the middle of the countryside and not used to any noise  we didn t take bad with this at all Breakfast was plentiful and tasted good  We only ate their one morning as we had booked into the Burj Al Arab for breakfast as a treat on the  nd day   which cost more than our two night stay at this hotel We met friends who were staying down on Jumeriah Beach and their hotel was lovely  very plush  although they paid the price for it I think this was a great hotel for business and a short stopover in Dubai  If you want luxury you have to pay for it  
N =>   Reasonable value for money We stayed at the Hawthorn during a one night layover               returning with Emirates airlines from the Maldives to Germany We didn t want to spend too much money on a hotel  so we would have more left for the mall     as it was just a layover and we were not going to spend any time in the room other than showering and sleeping  The room was nice and comfortable for our purpose  Mini gym on the  th floor only open during certain hours Disposal bin in the bathroom was broken and the safe was locked  a few minutes after we checked in  around        we called the reception and asked for someone to come up and open the safe   but nobody ever showed up General hotel information was not present in the room  breakfast times  gym opening times  ect    Breakfast was good and included a few middle east snacks which brought back memories    Talking about middle east memories   the IBM  inshalla  bukra  mumkin  mentality is evident We had a blast at the Deira mall and found Dubai absolutely amazing    
N =>   Good value for stop overs We stayed two nights in this hotel  as we were returning from Europe to Australia  We didn t want to spend too much money as we were not there for holidays  So the hotel was clean and well air conditioned There are two things we didn t like  the restaurant downstairs serve horrible food  catching a taxi is a nightmare during the day  But the hotel had free airport shuttle and also for shopping centre city centre shuttle We were happy overall  
N =>  worst hotel i have stayed uptil now I wont recommend this hotel to anybody  Very noisy place  looks like the windows also are not sound proof  The staff at the reception don t care whether you are having a pleasant stay or not  Since we were not satisfied with our room  we asked for another room  they turned a deaf ear to our request  The water kettle was leaking  The room is extremely small  That s the worst hotel i have been to  The price also is very expensive for the service they give  I wont rate that a   star but a   star  
N =>  Unhappy at Hawthorn Arriving at the Hawthorn at  am we expected that our Room would be ready but surprise  surprise it was not  Ater a    minute wait while they made up the spare bed for our daughter the room was finally ready  Our booking did state that it was to be a triple room  On getting into to our room we found the only way to flush the toilet was we had to take the lid off the cistern and flush it this way  On waking the next morning we discovered there were only two towels for three of us  After   phone calls and a visit to the front desk we finally got an extra towel  But the saga does not end there  Every time they changed our dirty towels they only left us two  After   frustrating days they finally got it right the day before we left  We called and reported the toilet not working properly to the front desk and man arrived to fix it just as we left to go out  On arriving back we discovered the toilet still not work properly  I finally fixed the toilet myself The hand rail in the shower was loose and the handle used to release the plug in the hand basin fell apart every time you used it To us the bathroom seemed if it had been made with cheap products and showdy workmanship On a positive side the room was clean and the staff in the Restaurants and at the breakfast buffet were very friendly We did fill out the customer survey before leaving and made our feelings about the hotel room felt Unfortunately with the problems we did have with the room I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone and have advised our Travel agent of the problems we experienced  
N =>   A Good Hotel Spring break       we decided to see Dubai  It s our first time in this part of the Persian Gulf  The free shuttle pickup at the airport was not there when we arrived so I had to call the hotel who sent one immediately  First impression of Hawthorn Deira was so so  even thought of transfering if we found something better  The room was not yet ready but the front desk was nice enough to upgrade us to a junior suite  There was subway construction going on outside the hotel so it was not a pretty sight  Our junior suite on the  th floor was spacious  clean  nice and very comfortable  There was a sitting area  The bathroom was modern and done in ceramic tiles throughout  There were plenty of cabinets  There was a big desk and the free internet provided was great  The window opened to the next building which was not a nice view but we didn t mind  The hallways are bright  nicely decorated  and clean  We slept right away as we were jetlagged  We took the Dubai Creek Dinner Cruise that evening and it was a great start to our fun vacation  The morning breakfasts were included and it was good with the usual stuff and an omellete bar  Breakfast menu was the same everyday  By the  nd day  we tossed the idea of moving to another hotel because we found out that our hotel was really very good after all  The location is central and very accessible  There are plenty of restaurants and shopping a few blocks away  Once the subway construction gets done in the future  Al Rigga Road in front of the hotel  is a nice road to walk  We felt safe  The Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank is across the street from the hotel and I use the ATM there everyday  Everything in Dubai is expensive  forget being tax free  everything is not cheap  Hotel  shopping  gold  food  restaurants  tours  etc   prepare to pay more  Taxi is the only reasonable thing in Dubai  Aside from   K gold jewelry  they have a lot of beautiful jewelry designs in diamonds  amp  gemstones you ll find in the malls mostly  The gold souk had more gold jewelry  Again  not cheap  Unfortunately  Dubai prides itself on its tall buildings  amp  malls but forget to emphasize the importance of their culture  heritage and history  Coming from the States  who wants to see another mall or tall building  They have the Dubai Museum but I felt that they should do more with this than anything else if they want to attract tourism  I can t believe that part of their city tour includes the malls  Duh  They have big malls but only a few worth visiting because they are different  They are Wafi Mall  Souk Madinat Jumeirah  Ibn Battuta Mall  and the Mall of the Emirates  You ll find the indoor skiing at the Mall of the Emirates  It was interesting but I imagined it to be bigger  We paid      for a buffet dinner just so we can enter the famed so called   star Burj Al Arab Hotel in Jumeirah  It is not open to the public unless you are staying or dining there  It is all hype  The hotel is overrated  It is not all that  The lobby was not impressive and it was small  The hotels in Las Vegas are far better  The buffet was not even gourmet  Of course  we didn t see the rooms but I have a coffee table book of this hotel where they show the different rooms  The decor is too garish  loud  amp  outdated for my taste  Oh well  we just had to find out for ourselves  So my advice  save your money  The Wild Wadi Water Park was very nice  Riding all terrain vehicles in the sand was a lot of fun  The highlight of our trip was the trip to Abu Dhabi and the Desert Safari  Abu Dhabi is nicer than Dubai without the traffic problem  It is    miles southwest of Dubai and an easy ride passing thru Sheikh Zayed Road where all the tall buildings are being constructed in a row  catching a glimpse of the soon to be tallest building in the world  the Burj Dubai and stopping by at ina City  Ooops  I think I just gave you my entire take on Dubai beyond Hawthorn Deira  I m glad we came here  we learned a lot  It was a very good vacation and one we ll treasure  
N =>   Not So Appealing Hotel This hotel has restaurant but during my time of accommodation  morning breakfast was offered in a Banquet Hall in spite of the fact that I was not travelling in any group  Banquet Hall is so small that it get occupied so fast and we ve to wait for a long  Secondly  hotel room that was allotted to me  didn t have any safe lockers which is necessary for all travellers  
N =>  Don t stay here  We searched the internet for hotels in Dubai finding this one based on price  location and amenities as described on the website   quot Hotels n Europe com quot   We traveled    hours by air with a taxi to the hotel  only to find they didn t have a room for us and could not find our reservation  We presented our copy of the confirmation and it was a complete surprise to them  All they were willing to give us was a smoking twin  We left immediately and went to the Hyatt  
N =>  overpriced hotel with none facilties available as they say Hotel could not find my reservation when i got there  my Partner was already in the room but they could not locate any info  Rooms quite small  no slippers or bathrobes available as they say  around    min walk from Meena Bazaar Hotel has three clubs  bar  pub there is a fee to go in the club  alcohol far too expensive  music far too loud when you want to sleep Breakfast is very limited  no variety Swimming pool was under maintenence  we were not told Your better off to pay the extra     for something decent and more local  friendly  
N =>  Terrible hotel Booking through expedia was a complete nightmare with them leaving off return transfers  Resulted in having to make numerous costly calls to resolve this   very stressful considering is was only a   night trip   We were a party of   yet the filipino receptionist was adamant we had booked   rooms for   people even after showing our booking papers kept us waiting in reception for more than half an hour on arrival  Then we were locked out our rooms and asked to move right away when they realised    days later     that they had made a mistake We were exhausted after returning to the hotel at   pm after a whole day of business meetings and refused to be moved that night and had to move on the last day instead which really messed up our plans  I have never stayed in a place with such incompetent reception staff The disco was beyond sleezy as is the most of bur dubai  It was more like a strip joint with all male audience watching half naked women lined up and dancing for them   disgusting   Avoid the place at all costs     
N =>   Good stay We had something like    hours to spend on transit  so we booked this hotel expecting an early check in availability with its     hour  reception facility advertised For some reason  we could not find direct contact detail of the hotel  no ph  nor email  as we booked through a  rd party website  so we had to look around to find a way to arrange the hotel pick up service upon arrival  This took quite some time wondering around  and just as we gave up to get a taxi  I found the hotel driver picking up another guest  He was kind and arranged a car to come and collect us  We waited for about    minutes We checked in around  am no problem  except the breakfast that was supposed to be inclusive  wasn t and we felt disappointed of the miscommunication of the travel website  None the less  the service was OK  we got a room on the  th floor  so not much noise from the night club on the ground floor nor the roads outside   The lunch buffet was a great value I was hoping that there would be shops nearby  but not much to browse in the immediate area  We did not find any decent place to eat around the hotel  I was told the gold souk was NOT a walking distance and it indeed was a long way through a tunnel by taxi  Airport transfer service was good  although we had to leave earlier for our departure due to the hotel transport available only on the hour It was a good day  time stay there for us  no problems in service  no frills simple hotel  
N =>   Super budget hote however    I stayed at the Highland first week after Ramadan with my mum  gran and little sister  Upon arrival  our transfer guy was there on time to collect us  Shuttle bus   he carried our bags and was very polite and helpful  The hotel ride was about      mins On arrival at the hotel  our rooms were ready but not conjoining as we requested  we were told that a room next to mine would be availbale after two nights and they would move my mum n sister next to us but that didn t happen  We were given complimentary bottles of water and  not complimentary  snacks  which we realised only when we checked out and received our bill   which taught us a lesson First impression of the room was avergae  damp smell in bedroom which wore away but bathroom smell remained throughout our  night stay   comfortable and clean but not completely accomodating  There was no clock or ironing facilities  Bathroom was average size  no complaints The staff were very polite and hospitable  always ready to help  again no complaints  Breakfast is good  mostly the same verday though Perfect location  easy to get taxis around  Fab juice shop next to the bus stop outside the hotel  I was hooked  A piece of advice for anyone tourists visiting Dubai  DON T use the hotel to book excursions  They charge so much more  its a complete rip off  Always book them yourself in advance or while you are in Dubai  there are looooooads of tourism companies  Near the reception area  there is an Indian  family  restaurant    uhhh I don t think so  I went with my family n we walked back out      in there were men  old pervy types n the live entertainment was perfect for them    I ll leave you to judge I requested the top level floor in the hotel by reading previous reviews about noise and believe me  I am happy I did  There is a club on the first floor and the noise can still be heard on the  th floor  just not as bad  I wouldn t advise this hotel as being a family hotel at all  in the evening lots of men arrive at the hotel  looking for entertainment  at the same time  lots of  lovely  females stroll in    again I leave you to be the judge The rooftop pool is wonderful  small but nice  Sauna is okay  not bad Overall  you get what you pay for from this hotel  nothing more and nothing less  Not a family hotel  More for couples and adults  Not child friendly If you would like to ask me more question  email me at mello    hotmail comMehreen 
N =>   Nice hotel but not as a  family  hotel Stayed at this hotel with my wife  amp  kids  despite booking almost a month in advance  they didn t have the executive suite ready on arrival and we had to settle for alternative rooms  this seemed a common problem as I overheard other guests complaining about the same issue   The rooms are clean and spacious and bathroom also very clean  we stayed on the  rd floor   The reception area was average in size by Dubai standards  It was largely male dominated as the entrance to the  dawat  club is through the recepion area and was frequented by men only  This was a bit of a nuisance if you have kids with you  The noise from this club could be heard on the  rd floor till late night though it was only a muffled noise  not too bad  The breakfast was good with a quite a variety to choose from  the restaurant  I thought was expensive hence not very busy  Swimming pool and gym on the top floor roof top was satisfactory  Access to the beach  Jumeira  and other shopping areas was reasonably easy via taxis though depending on the time some cab drivers refused to take us because of excessive traffic  Overall not a bad hotel but I wouldn t recommend it for a family stay  
N =>  A good deal We stayed at this hotel for two nights from ruary        to ruary          Overall  it is worth the money you give as you can find some really good rates for this hotel which includes free return airport transfers  The Hotel is in Bur Dubai district and you can easily go anywhere by a taxi  in Dubai  you have no other choice than a taxi   The staff and the everyone working at the Hotel were helpful and tried to respond to our needs when asked for  We could even get an early check in  at      AM  probably as we were travelling by Emirates Recommended  
N => Don t bother this the Hyland Be warned  If you are planning a stop over in Dubai and you want to get some sleep  then don t stay at the Hyland The walls and floors are paper thin and you can hear the pulsing nightclubs from the lower floors Plus when we stayed there  We arrived at  am and all we wanted to do was grab a shower and go to sleep First problem  No towels  When we rang housekeeping we were told there were no towels until  am   Second problem  The people next door were having a very loud conversation and it was like they were in the same room  We heard their room service arrive at  am  even heard the scraping of the knives on their plates  On the positive side  once we complained to reception they did ring the noisy room and ask them to quiet down  They did a little bit  but we could still hear them We spoke to some other guests who had to demand to be moved from teh  nd floor as they were directly above the nightclub and said it was very very loud and the floor was vibrating  
N =>   very noisy if you like night clubs  amp  noise stay at this hotel  we had    hours at the hotel and found the staff very rude the noise unbearable  The breakfast was   the worst we have ever had   we stayed at another hotel in dubai    days previus with the same star rating that was far superior   on check out it took nearly    minutes to check out and get our passports back  we were picked up and droped of by arrabia travel who were fantastic  
N =>  Nice Hotel rude staff  We stayed at this hotel from   th e to   th e  The hotel itself had excellent location and the daily breakfast was wonderful but our only problem was with the room service staff  Whenever we asked for some hot water or ordered some food to our room  the person who delivered used to glare at us before leaving  Such people should not be working in the hotel line  
N =>   A cozy place in the heart of the city A cozy and trendy hotel   The room was very spacious  The service was excellent  Food was average  Excellent place to stay over night or    
N =>  Excellent would come back  Rooms excellent with fantastic panaromic views of Dubai  Excellent  food  both restaurants had excellent choices which made it so really difficult to choose where to eat It really was such a hard choice to choose between Gordan Ramsay Verre or Glasshouse   The hotel has a courtesy bus which takes you to the Dubai Jumeriah hotel  where you can walk along the beach such a pity we were not told that we were going to the beach as we would have packed swimsuits So for future reference take your swimwear along All in all it was an amazing experience and one of the top recomondations would be a night safari recomended by the hotel  I am so glad I went on one It has to be the total highlight of my holiday  
N =>  Good hotel Was initally concerned about some of the negative reviews on facebook  but need not have been  Had a really nice  clean spacious room  Good central location for anyone wanting to stay in Dubai for a few days  Anything longer then that you may wish to stay in a resort type of hotel  Only downside was that the pool was rather small  Overall this is a very good hotel and I would recommend this hotel for a short stay  
N =>   Very good   but not impressed To conclude the hotel itself   it s a perfect business hotel  great spacious room with everything you need  friendly  and serviceminded staff and a perfect location in  quot Old Dubai quot   Added values is the rooftop pool  Verre by Gordon Ramsey and a free shuttle service to Hilton at Dubai Jumeirah Beach  We was also picked up by their very ncie Audi limousine at the aiport upon arrival on complimentary basis  We had a Large King Corner Executive wich had a nice view of the creek  Everything you expect from a upper end Hilton with Crabtree  amp  Evelyn premium amenities  free bottled mineral water  great beds  turndown service etc  Nice to make your own coffee in the Lavazza machine  One night it was thunder at we could see the thounders going over the Sheik Al Zayed road from the hughe windows  They could be better to clean the room  due I find both a black small hair in the bathtub as well as old candle lights  We visit the Verre by Gordon Ramsey   it was a fantastic evening  A great selection of both wines and food together with delicated service  It s well worth the money  If you want to eat outside the hotel  the other restaurant where we had breakfast was a little bit boring  you should visit the Radisson SAS Hotel with several restaurants  Roomservice to resonable prices and is a wide menu  We had a pasta one evening wich was great  The Executive lounge isn t so great  I was happy to stayed at a Bed  amp  Breakfast rate because it was a poor selection of breakfast items in the lounge buffet  The Hilton Breakfast in restaurant was  as always  great Small annying things in their service is that we had to wait over    min to get our luggage to be bring down from the room  once we tried to call front desk and they didn t answer as well as they messed up our bills at the pool bar wich took over    minutes to solve  I would stay here again but should consider to stay at the Radisson SAS if I was to Dubai in business and Hilton Jumeirah if I was for leisure  
N =>   Nice Room   Awful Service I chose this hotel for close proximity reasons  As soon as I got there the staff kept me waiting for   hours as my room was not ready even though i was a hilton silver card holder and I had emailed in advance to check if all was ok Rude service from the asian staff members  Price was above average for room but room was nice  Gordon Ramsays Verre was too dark and the staff took its time in serving food  Will def not stay here again Extremely disappointed  
N =>   A good base We stayed here in ober for   nights on our way home from the Maldives  Having stayed at the beach before we wanted a more central location and to see a bit more of Dubai The room was excellent  It was a very large room with all the facilities you could want  The bathroom was also big  Mirrors everywhere in the bathroom  Our TV was a bit tempremental and needed to be fixed several times from reception  Breakfast was fab   everything you could think of was available  We also ate in the Glasshouse one night and the food was excellent  The cocktail bar on the ground floor was a bit disappointing   but the cocktails were lovely The concierge was extremely helpful This may not be one of the most stunning hotels in Dubai  but it was excellent value and it was a great base for us to explore Dubai  
N =>   Not expected i never expect the kind of service to these well known hotel chain     i ve been to a lot of hotels but this one was totally different    a DISAPPOINTMENT    From check in till check out was horrible     hotel should changed there ratings as   star     
N =>   A real let down Stayed for   nights as reviews when i booked were pretty good  but we were not impressed  firstly we were kept waiting to check in  then for our rooms  even though it was  pm  Room was like a bachelor pad   Lots of black  leather  chrome and mirrors  plus a grotty looking worn carpet  The shower was so badly designed it flooded the whole of the bathroom floor  Breakfast was the only half decent event  plenty of choice and attentive staff  For a city that really only offers hotels shops and sunshine it was one of the worst hotels i have stayed in  The pool area was embarrassingly bad  i really would only recommend this place to people i do not like    
N =>  Great view from the balcony I stayed in the Hilton Dubai Creek for four nights in y and all I can say is wow  From the time I was picked up from the airport in a very comfortable Audi A  to the time I checked out the service and experience was great  It is not that common these days when the staff greats you by name when you enter the hotel  The room was fantastic with a wrap around balcony and a full sized bar  Service was also very good  infact uopn arrival I neglected to purchase a calling card  no worries  the front desk sent someone out to purchase etilsat calling cards for me and this was after   pm  I plan on staying here during my next mini holiday in Dubai  Be advised that the suites do not show up on the Hilton website  you will have to call the toll free number to inquire  
N =>   Some nice touches but not the best in Dubai Interesting location   great view of the creek if you are lucky enough to get an exec suite with creek view Some problems with lack of hot water and flooded bathroom which took a little time to resolve Nice roof top pool with great views over Dubai SOme staff very friendly  others have difficulty to understand english Average exec lounge Bit of a trek to get to Sheikh Zayet Road  Business centre and Jumeriah beach but very good for the airport Overall   average score only  
N =>   Bad Service  Rude staff I ll never come back to this hotel  aside having a bad service  the staff were also rude   I d rather stay in Radisson or Sheraton with a much better location  
N =>   Very good but with some room for improvement We had arrived at the Dubai Creek location having spent two days at its sister property in Jumeirah Beach  Initial impressions of the service weren t so great  The bellmen decided to stay inside looking at my wife and I as we got our bags out of the car and went to the front desk  We were directed up to the Executive Lounge to check in and were told that as I had selected to have extra HHonors points put into my account then they wouldn t be upgrading me  Fine with me  I m a little spoiled by other Hilton properties  such as Hilton Jumeirah Beach   but the attitude seemed a little snooty  The room we were given was on the  st floor  despite my HHonors preferences asking for higher floors  Fortunately the  st floor is more like the  th floor of the building itself but we were overlooking a quite busy road  Judging by the fire escape map it seemed the Deluxe Plus corner room I d booked was quite a bit bigger than the standard one  so money well spent  I fired up my laptop to get on the wireless internet which I was under the impression was included in the rate  It didn t seem to be so I went back to the Executive Lounge and was told in no uncertain terms that no rates included wireless internet  I asked if it was possible to look up the wording on the Hilton website  where I d booked  and was told it wasn t really worth it since no rates include it  I gave up and went downstairs and asked the same question and was met with a much more helpful answer  The wording on the internet was very ambiguous and causes problems etc etc  Much better   The room itself was quite nice  The bathroom was very modern with see through countertop and lots of black marble  I quite liked it The hotel itself is quite small  the elevators even smaller   which gives the place quite a nice atmosphere  Nice rooftop pool with bar which we used  Location was quite good too  just across from the creek but we did need to use taxis in the heat rather than walk around   mins or so to where the souks were The restaurants are quite good  We ate at the Glasshouse for breakfast as it was included in the Executive Lounge package we opted to pay for      AED per day  and the service and selection was rather good  The ordered dishes were also excellent One evening we ate at Verre  the Gordon Ramsay restaurant  While some don t appreciate it I thought it was rather good  Excellent service and food to boot  Prestige menu worth going for but it did take us      hours to get through Overall  the service could do with a little polishing in places but the rooms  restaurants  common areas are really rather good  
N =>  Horrible rude service Do not stay here  Staff is extremely rude and poorly trained  They tried to apply extra charges at every possible opportunity  
N =>   fantastic alan  amp  diane          hotel fantastic glasshouse great food verre nice but expensive 
N =>   Hard to beat We booked this hotel less than   weeks before we were due to arrive and we think we got a good deal          for   nights in an Executive Suite on the   th floor  We happened to see another room on a lower floor which looked considerably smaller than ours  We felt that our room was worth the extra cost  but i m sure that all the rooms are comfortable  Our bathroom shower was great  and I expect they are all the same   It s more of a business hotel  but this suited us   If we went again with children we would probably stay at the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah as this is situated on the beach   The hotel runs a free daily shuttle bus to and from the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah where you can use their facilities  however  you have to book your seat in advance with reception  If you don t get a seat  there is a roof top pool which is perfectly fine for catching the sun   Although  as it is so far up it can get very windy  This didn t do much to cool us down in   but it did mean that we couldn t keep an umbrella up for long   There are two good shopping malls that are a short taxi ride away  Try not to leave at closing time on a Friday evening though as you will easily wait an hour or more for a taxi  We didn t make any big purchases  but if you re a girl who likes clothes and shoes you can expect to save around     on UK prices  The hotel food was lovely   Due to our room type our breakfast was included and it was served until   am  I think  which we were pleased about  There was a buffet  fresh fruit  yogurts  cereal  croissants  plus table service  bacon sandwiches  english fried breakfast  eggs benedict   There are two good restaurants  one of which Gordon Ramsey has put his name to  and they weren t too expensive  There is also a bar next to the lobby and a poolside bar which serves food  With regards to service  we couldn t fault it  All staff went out of their way to be polite and helpful I would definitely stay at this hotel again   We have compared every hotel that we have stayed in since  and none have matched it   
N =>   Excellent hotel   very modern This hotel is excellent in regards to looks and feel  As typical  the staff are more than friendly  The room was very modern and IKEA like it was truly refreshing  While it was very near the airport and obviously had a great view of Dubai Creek   our biggest concern was there wasn t much we found within walking distance  Also  taxi s seemed hard to call from this location  The rooftop pool was very cool  Loved the bathroom  I would stay again  
N => Nice but some things need attention The Hilton Dubai Creek has a few things to recommend it  The rooms are now about   years old and are showing a little of their age  but still very nice  The showers and hot water situation needs attending to  I was on the  th Floor and hot water took    minutes  They tried to address it  but several people in our group found the same thing  The shower also leaked all over the floor because it only pointed toward the door and could not be turned down to the floor  It needed a rolled up towel to keep the floor from flooding    not a big deal  but a small inconvenience Beds were good  Housekeeping did not clean all of the mirrors  but the room was well cleaned  I got to see the notes from previous occupants when the mirror steamed up The in room internet was     Dirhams a day        US  Unreasonable for basic access  I was told that many nearby hotels offfered free wireless that was actually accessible from the rooms of the Hilton  As with all the UAE  the alcohol was insanely expensive  About     for a mini bar Semillon Chardonnay       cocktails in the lounge  Verre  the Gordon Ramsay restaurant  was oustanding  Yes  the wine list was absurdly priced  but that is expected in the UAE  The service was very good  It seems that Dubai s fine dining establishments are somewhat obsessed with in between course offerings  This was true of Verre  but they did a nice job  It was all well presented  Meals were far better and far less money than the Aquarium at Burj Al Arab  The restaurant was not full  but the ambiance was good   not romantic perhaps  but appropriate for business entertaining The common areas are a bit small and the executive lounge was overcrowded  The front desk staff needs a good lesson in customer service  The concierge was fairly helpful  but the check in and check out staff need to learn to smile and work WITH their customers  The rest of the staff was very good  but the front desk needs a wholesale change  Overall  I would say the hotel is about     out of   for a Hilton  AND  at nearly      a night  they really need to work on fine tuning the service  It seems if you get the Executive Lounge  life is good  but when it is overcrowded  the rest of the peasants get the same mixed bag  
N =>  Fantastic hotel Stayed at this hotel for four nights from   th of   everything about it was brilliant  location was perfect away from all the building work elsewhere in Dubai  staff were very friendly and helpful  we stayed in an executive creek view room which was amazing and allowed you access to the executive lounge which served snacks all day and free drink from  pm until      pm  Food in the hotel was very good  breakfasts were superb  Rooftop pool was very nice  small but in uary not busy  hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the Hilton on Jumeirah beach and a free complementary taxi back to the airport for guests staying in the executive rooms which are well worth it  The waiter Eric who looks after everybody in the executive lounge was an absolute gem  could not do enough to make the guests stay a very memorable one  
N =>   Fantastic room and view  Stayed her three nights on a reward stay  Everything was great  We did get a room upgrade to a magnificant room with view to the creek  The hotel staff was great  The pool on the roof was a very nice place to relax  but there was a little few sunbeds up there  The restaurant was great  but we did not try the best of them  the Gordon Ramsey one   due to our dressing  we did not feel comfortable as we travelled very  quot light quot    The hotel limo service that was arranged for our private sightseeing was great  
N =>   amazing We stayed to the Hilton Dubai Creek for our honeymoon  everything was clean and tidy  nice place with nice staff The hotel is center located  it  s really easy to reach the main part of the town  shopping centers  gold suq    We suggest this hotel to everybody  We didn t want to leave Rossana  amp  Domenico Nuzzolese  Italy  
N =>  Great Stay We just came back from a one week stay at the Hilton Dubai Creek  It was great  We got the Excutive class rooms that allowed access to the lounge  happy hour and car service to take you to and from the airport  The room was modern  clean and nice  The hotel staff were always very friendly and helpful  This hotel happens to be home to Gordon Ramsey s Verre as well It s about a       Dirham taxi ride each way to the major shopping malls and a short taxi ride from the gold souks  Beware of getting taxis back to your hotel from the souks  There s never enough taxis and people end up waiting forever for one  We got in a taxi that tried to charge us off the meter  Don t take that  There s a meter for a reason  If you want to eat at the Burg Hotel  make sure you book in advance  probably before you arrive  They are really busy  so we couldn t get a spot until the day we were due to leave  
N =>  A bit over rated  We did a stopover in Dubai and stayed in Hilton Creek for one night in a Deluxe room We arrived in the early morning flight and the room was ready  staff very professional  The room was not that big although the bathroom was really good Beds  twin room  were quite narrow  buffet breakfast was very basic  not the typical Hilton breakfast   the area  The creek  is advisable only if you are on business otherwise I recomend to choose any of the sea front resorts  
N =>   The staff made us feel uncomfortable The hotel itself and the restuarant was very nice  however after our first night we went for a meal in the resturant and we had a voicemail left in the morning asking us to call the manager  We did so thinking they might be congratulating us on our recent wedding in Maurituis  however the lady told us a ring had gone missing in the ladies toilets and as i was the only woman staying in the hotel they had looked at CC TV and seen me going into the ladies  they asked me if i would mind having my room searched and even speaking to the police  As you can imagine we were absolutely gobsmacked and it runied the remainder of our stay  I asked if they were joking as i was so shocked and the comment i received back  was this was a very serious matter   like i was being accused  My husband went and spoke to the manager who then came to my room and tried to tone the situation down  which was very diferent to our telephone converation  It turned out the lady who had lost her ring  her father was very high up in the police force in Dubai  Nothing came of it  but it left a sour taste in our mouths     
N =>  Splendid Hotel We stayed here for   nights in e  We arrived from a night flight from London so we got there early about  ish  are room wasn t ready which we were surprised about as i m sure there are lots of night flights coming in  so we went upstairs and chilled by the pool on the roof  with amazing views When we did get our room it was more then what we expected huge bathroom and comfy beds  great staff service aswell  always bent over backwards to accomodate you The location was good and your only       minutes away from the beach We went there for music reason and we weren t disappointed by the clubs  especially the  quot Apartments quot  Glad they had air conditioning everywhere as it was so hot  Made the cab rides more enjoyable  
N =>   Good location and excellent service We booked for   nights including breakfast  Arrived on a morning flight and went to hotel  Had requested early check in  room was not ready on arrival  but we were offered the option of taking breakfast while they were finishing off the room  As flight out would require us to leave the hotel before breakfast opened  they offered to  move  that breakfast to the arrival day  Very nice touch and good thinking During a wonderful breakfast  the check in clerk came in with the room keys  The bed and breakfast rate allows you to take anything from the buffet or the menu  including the  superior  coffees  such as espresso and cappuccino  which non inclusive guests have to pay separate  Too bad we were there for only   breakfasts as the menu and buffet were so extensive we did not get to try everything  The hotel is designed in such a way that  I believe  all rooms have a view of the Creek  with the rooms positioned in a fish bone pattern facing the Creek  The corner rooms do have the best view of course  but our room one over still had an excellent view  had a well thought out layout and huge bathroom  Contrary to many hotels  they actually put enough lamps in this room  including having lamps in the closets and spotlights pointing into the closets This an excellent  reasonably priced  small  by Dubai standards  hotel with excellent service  ideal for visiting the city  If you do want to go to the beach  there is a shuttle bus to the Hilton Jumeirah   having visited it  I would not want to stay there now  with all the construction going on around it  
N =>   We wanted good but got FANTASTIC  Our family    over    s  amp    adult daughters decided upon this hotel because   good reports on this site    photos from this site  amp  brochures of the excellent views    proximity to the airport     mins by car  amp  the fact we were arriving in rush hour  We didn t get delayed by any traffic as it happened     no childrens clubs activities play areas etc were provided  We were not disappointed in any way  We booked through Hotels com  amp  got a very good deal  We had boked executive rooms which included breakfast  use of the executive lounge  amp  complimentary transfers  We  phoned the hotel direct   days before our hols to arrange with the concierge pick up time from the airport  amp  flight no  The chauffeur was waiting for us after we cleared immigration which was quick  amp  hassle free We were taken to the executive lounge to check in  amp  offered drinks whilst we carried out this process The first room we were shown was      which was large  fab view  amp  spotlessly clean but didn t have a bath in the bathroom only a shower albeit a large one The staff member disappeared for a minute  amp  returned with another card key   Don t forget to put a card key in the holder on the wall to operate lights  air con etc  We had rooms       amp        Both rooms were very large with kingsize beds  our daughters didn t mind sharing but the staff had offered to separate the bed into    amp  then remake them   The views from both rooms took our breath away as it was dark outside  amp  we could see twinkling lights which reflected on the river  creek  The bathrooms were stunning by the way they were spotlessly clean  decorated with chrome  marble  amp  good use made of mirrors  A wall mounted small chrome circular disc was actually a washing line for wet costumes A coffee machine was on display  our daughters wanted to use theirs  amp  a housekeeper unlocked it  supplied bottled water to fill it  amp  showed them how to use it  We located a kettle  amp  sachets in one of the cupboards  Complimentary bottles of water were replenished daily The beds  amp  pillows were soooo comfy  amp  linen of excellent quality Bathrobes  amp  slippers were provided  amp  were very useful when popping up to the rooftop pool at any time of the day  Towels were suppiled at the pool  There were    loungers by the pool  amp  several tables  amp  chairs near the bar area Electricity is by   pin plug the same as the UK We booked seats on the complimentary shuttle that runs between this hotel  amp  the Hilton Jumeriah Beach  It s worth it for the ride alone  A good day out for the beach  sea  amp  looking around another hotel There is massive building work going on in various areas of Dubai but not much near our hotel  We didn t notice any dust or any noise whatsoever The gift shop is good for postcards  stamps  souveniers  amp   Amoxil  antibiotic capsules   I kid you not Breakfasts were excellent with dishes from the buffet regularly replenished  Full breakfasts from waffles  amp  pancakes to scrambled eggs  amp  smoked salmon were available The service was very good with the staff remembering what each of us had ordered previously with regard to juices  amp  tea coffee We had a meal in the Issimo Bar one evening  amp  it was very good value  We had a meal on the rooftop another night  amp  the food was good but waited for    minutes for it to arrive All the staff we encountered were professional  helpful  efficient  amp  courteous  Taxis are availavble outside the hotel  amp  are as reasonable as folks have previously stated  A    min ride to the Hard Rock Cafe for   of us was    dirhams  approx        plus tip  We read in a tourist mag that if a taxi driver starts tailgating tell him to slow down or you won t give him a tip We had been given a business card from the hotel with a small map on it for location should a taxi driver not be familiar with the hotel  they all were  We went to the Diera Mall but I would think other Malls would be more interesting  The queue for a taxi back to the hotel was very long but within   mins we were on our way so no problem We didn t have time to take the  BIg Bus Tour  but I would suggest you try to do it     different trips  hopping on  amp  off  amp  including a dhow trip can be taken within   hrs representing very good value for money  If you think that you will be arriving or departing the airport at a busy time then you can book  haba  meaning welcome  services        I read that with effect from   th e the airport authorities will be implementing the  liquids in a small clear plastic bag  sytsem that we currently have in the UK A lot of items eg alcohol appear to be cheaper than duty free in UK I know that this report is long but if you ve waded through it I hope that you find it helpful  
N =>   Dubai has some fantastic hotels   Unfortunately this is not one of them  Stayed at the Hilton Dubai Creek to ring in the new year   Inconsistency was the only word to describe it  Definitely not a    hotel Being a gold VIP member we checked in at the executive lounge  the room we had booked on the executive floor was not available so we were offered an alternative room on another floor  I had no issue with this but asked could we still access the lounge and was told that no  this would not be possible due to the fact that supplies in the lounge were running low  what an excuse   It wasn t as if they were offering unlimited food and drink in the lounge  which was tiny  and all we wanted was to access the internet and as a gold member I would have expected to be able to do this On checking in I asked what was going on in the hotel to ring in the new year  The receptionist said she didn t know but would find out  When getting the room keys from the same girl later I asked again if she had found out  She said she hadn t but that she would get someone with more information to call to my room  At the same time she handed me an envelope which I assumed was a welcome letter so I just put it in my bag  Needless to say no one called to the room with details   however when I looked at the letter much later in the evening I discovered it was an invitation to the new years party and contained four vouchers for free drinks in the bar for that night  What a nice touch   but really the gesture was lost since she did not even know what she was giving me  When we checked up on this we eventually found out after   phone calls that they had even reserved a table for us in advance and all we needed to do was confirm the time  If the receptionist had handed me the vouchers and invitation saying that she had checked and that we were booked into the restaurant and were receiving complimentary vouchers then what a difference it would have made to the whole experience  When we got to our room there was a king bed   even though I was staying with my sister and had requested twin beds   this room overlooked the apartment block next to the hotel where you could see all the tenants washing hanging out on the balcony and their rubbish bags  not a pretty sight  We eventually got changed to a twin room   but this was   hours later  after   phone calls to the room from various people with contradictory messages and a knock on the door which was someone with a camp bed  I have never stayed in a   star hotel where I have been offered to sleep on a camp bed for the duration of my stay  Onto the room   We had a turndown service just   out of five nights  Fresh dates were also only delivered   nights  A fresh fruit basket appeared one night and then was left sitting there for the following three nights  The cleaner made himself known to us as our cleaner anytime we passed him in the corridor   which I assume was for a tip and one morning woke us with a knock on the door to ask what time we wanted the room cleaned  We could hear everything happening in the rooms next to us   and even could hear the toilets flushing and the shower running in the room above us  There is also a lot of traffic from main road in front of the hotel   hrs a day and constant noise from planes overhead to and from the nearby airport  One night there was a party until     am   but when I called reception at  am they said it could just be the piped music in the hall     there was no piped music in the hall  and did nothing about it  The next day when I asked at reception about it they said they never received the call from me  New Years dinner was ok  the waiters were great but again were falling over themselves asking you if you wanted wine etc but this gets annoying when you are asked   times by   different waiters in the space of    minutes  It was the same at breakfast each morning   the same questions and messages from at least two members of staff each time  To be honest they were trying their best but lack the extra bit of training which would make them more professional  And that was the same for all staff for the duration of the stay   they were always asking if there was anything they could do for you   but if you actually asked them to do something then they completely balked and could never do what you wanted them to  It was as if they had been told to be nice and ask if everything was ok for the guests  but were not trained to handle any situation which may arrise As part of the new years package we got complimentary access to the nightclub   Again a nice touch but there was a lot of confusion about using the vouchers even though it stated on the voucher that they would be accepted in the nightclub  Eventually they were taken but the last thing you want is to be embarrassed at the bar each time you want to use the voucher  I would have preferred to have paid for the drink at the end of it  With five minutes to go to midnight we were told to get ready for the countdown   but the countdown never happened at all so no one knew it was    until we checked our watches later and realised they had missed it  There also seems to be lots of  call girls  in the hotel on that night in particular When we checked of the hotel at   pm the receptionist was surprised we were checking out so late since we had paid to stay for the night   but she never asked why or was there a reason or if we had enjoyed our stay  What a difference it would make if she had asked was everything ok and that she hoped we had enjoyed our stay  Overall the hotel is new so it is very clean and the reception and the staircase look very well   especially since they had it decorated for Christmas  But that is they only thing that I found nice about the hotel  I would compare it to the new rooms in the Hilton Metropole in London which is   star and is basically a business hotel  I must say thought that I do travel extensively and I do have fairly high expectations when it comes to    hotels      should be    in every aspect  so if you are not that fussy and don t mind the inconsistent service then this hotel is fine for a business trip or a non luxury trip to Dubai    but with so many other luxury hotels there I would give this one a miss  
N =>  Good hotel but book early for trips  We stayed at this hotel from Boxing Day until New Year s Eve       We had booked an Executive Room  and the free pick up from the airport went very smoothly  We checked into our room and we were a little disappointed to find out it was next to the lift shaft  As such  the bathroom did not have a bath in it  just a shower  and the room was a strange shape  We asked at reception if it was possible to change rooms and the following evening we were contacted by the Executive Lounge receptionist and offered another  better room  This room had a bath and was a better room overall We ate in Verre one night  although that nearly did not happen because we realised about an hour before we due to dine that it was a  quot dry quot  day in Dubai and the restaurant was not open   despite us having a booking confirmed by the restaurant manager  After a few enquiries  and speaking to the General Manager it was confirmed that we had a booking for the following night   but we had not been told this originally  As a result we got a free glass of champagne and desserts in the restaurant  We thought the restaurant was excellent We tried to book a couple of trips through the hotel concierge  but were disappointed to find out that they were booked up  The one we had particularly wanted to go on was the trip to the Godolphin stables  I had e mailed the hotel about this trip some weeks before we travelled and they said it would be ok to book when we arrived  but sadly this did not work out  The stables tour was fully booked for the following   weeks  If you would like to go on this tour do not wait until you arrive to book it We are glad we did not stay down at the beach  as it looked like a complete construction site  Taxis are so cheap to get around in  but the traffic is appalling  
N =>  It s OK but we wouldn t go back We booked here for   nights           We booked and paid for an executive room I m HH Gold and got no upgrade or benefits because of this On the plus side we arrived at the hotel  via the private transfer in a nice car  at  am  by  am they had a room ready for us so I was pleased about that  obviously this is just down to chance though The room itself was OK  no wow factor for us despite the floor to ceiling windows and a nice bathroom  it just wasn t all that special in our opinion  The beds were comfy though  our view was part creek and mostly of the big building next to the hotel Now  onto the executive lounge   IT IS DREADFULL  It too small for one thing  They have a coffee machine so you can help yourself to that all day  Soft drinks are supposed to be available all day  they are but you have to either ask for one or wait to be asked  The problem is there was often just one member of staff in there and they were mostly busy at the desk so you had to wait ages for a simple glass of water  Most lounges I ve been in have soft drinks and water available for you to help yourself too  they could have some small fridges under the counters on the side  there is room Happy hour was OK but if you wanted beer or wine  you had to ask for it or wait to be asked  it was a nightmare when it was busy as you can imagine  They did leave spirits out and a few  and I mean very few  cans of soft drinks out at happy hour The food offerings we re very poor too  the room was too warm and they would have salmon  mayo  In sandwiches  etc just sat out in it for hours  you d have to be desperate to eat there Being in an exec room we should ve had fruit delivered daily but this only happened after we complained about not getting it for two days We ate at the Glasshouse on Christmas Day  this was really nice and a reasonable price too  We had breakfast included but only went   days  Breakfast was just OK  sure it was a buffett but not too exciting  plus I witnessed too many people just picking things up and putting them down again or not using a cloth to hold the breads when cutting them  You could order hot stuff from the menu but the portions were small  but well presented and always very greasy if ordering bacon or omlettes or anything similar I can t complain about the location as we knew exactly where it was and what to expect  It was handy for us to go off and watch football in the Chelsea Arms pub in the Sheraton which was just a couple of minutes walk away The fitness centre is tiny  two treadmills  one bike  one recline bike  one cross trainer and a knackered rower plus   fixed weight machines and some free weights  It was all very cramped and again  it was too hot to work out in properly We had no trouble with the staff and we never had problems getting a taxi either  All the staff were very friendly We popped up to the pool area  it looked nice but was always busy as it s very small  we never intended on sunbathing as we never thought it was warm enough  especially as it was always breezy up there Overall I can only give it   out of   as we were just dissapointed with it all  it just did not live up to the tripadvisor hype for us  
N =>  Good Location Good Service As regular visitors to Dubai myself and my wife have stayed at a variety of city centre    Hotels  we always shop around for the best prices but always found the Hilton to be alittle more expensive than others  this time we managed to get a good deal for ten nights through British Airways so decided to give it a go  We arrived around  pm and had no problem in checking in at this time  a good start  The room was very spacious  complete with king size bed and a beautifull view of the creek from the full length windows  you wouldn t want to suffer from vertigo      We used the shuttle service to the beach most days and found that the building works at the beach were no problem although getting back through the traffic at night took almost one hour  The staff were very helpfull and although we didn t visit Verrre we did eat a few times at the Glasshouse  the food was good and reasonably priced  The only thing that I had to complain about was the taxi  service  outside the hotel  depending on where you wanted to go the taxi drivers were sometimes unwilling to accept your fare  I did complain to the Concierge but it made little difference so we ended up flagging down our own taxi out on the street  All in all a very good experience  
N =>   We really enjoyed the Hilton Dubai Creek Overall we really enjoyed our stay  We had booked into an Executive room  which included free airport transfers and access to the executive lounge Our airport transfer was great  we took a while to get through passport control  but the driver hotel contacted Emirates airlines to confirm that we indeed boarded in Glasgow  He basically waited for   hours  On route he was very chatty and offered us a cold drink of water  The check in went smoothly  When we arived in our bedroom there was rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom with a small oil burner lit  Everything was imaculate  The toiletries were from Crabtree and Evelyn and were heavenly  The staff were friendly and courteous throughout  although the accents can make it difficult for guests and staff to communicate properly Breakfast was fabulous everyday and the fact that they serve breakfast to   am everyday means you don t need to get up at the crack of dawn to eat  The selection was fabulous and the service was good The rooftop pool was great  there was not many loungers     in all  and   tables  Considering this is more a business hotel  it seemed reasonable and we never struggled to get a lounger  although only went up twice   The pool I thought was a good size and great for a cool down and a few  quot mini quot  lengths  In previous reviews people stated that they were disappointed by the size of the pool  but i feel that if they wanted to do olympic laps they should go to an olympic swimming pool The executive lounge was nice and peaceful during the day  I have to say that the staff member who was present in the lounge was not that  quot hospitable quot  in terms of checking whether we wanted anything and we had to get up to ask her for a refill of our soft drinks etc  The snacks at happy hour were nice and the one time we were in at happy hour the lounge wasn t too busy and although we do not drink alcohol  but noticed they had a wide selection The small shop in the lobby had a great selection of curios souveneirs  and some of the things were actually cheaper than Deira City Centre etc  So do have a look Our room was right next to the executive lounge and we managed to connect to the wireless connection from the lounge in our room so basically had access      which was great We did not actually dine in Verre or Glasshouse  but the menu for the Glasshouse looked nice and seemed reasonably priced The only two negative points we experienced was the fact that the very fancy looking coffee machine did have any instructions on how to work it and when we did figure it out it only makes half a cup of coffee  We went without tea for   nights thinking we couldn t get any boiling water from the coffee machine and when the engineer came up he then pointed out that there was a kettle in the cupboard above the television  didn t even know it was a cupboard as it s all wood panelling and I wouldn t have reached it cos it s quite high up   We had asked for a non smoking room  and for our whole stay    nights  this was fine  but we woke on the last day to the smell of smoke  sending me into a sneezing fit  Even when we got home and opened our suitcases our clothes still smelled of smoke  We did not say anything to the hotel  although in hindsight should ve  as we were leaving the next day and it wasn t too much of a bother for us at that point as we were having such a great time in Dubai overall We wouldn t pay this much for a hotel in Dubai again  as we really only used it as a base and feel that although we could afford it we d rather spend our money on doing things in Dubai  
N =>  beware  rude unhelpful staff very rude staff  donot honour their bedroom bookings made by telephone  prior to arrival attempt to double room fees 
N =>  Wonderful Hotel We stayed   nights at the Hilton Dubai Creek  The staff were very welcoming on our arrival  Throughout our stay nothing was a problem  they staff could not have been more helpful  Our room was very spacious and very Bevcomfortable  We had a corner room so had fantastic views over the Creek  The restaurants in the hotel are both first class  We dined twice in the Glasshouse Restaurant and once in Gordon Ramsay s Verre restaurant  An experience we will not forget  We found the hotel well positioned for what we wanted and would certainly stay there again  
N =>  Nice hotel We were in Dubai on holiday between the end of uary      and early ruary       The staff were very courteous  We had requested   non smoking rooms but were allocated smoking rooms which we did not like  However we had no problem changing these    rooms   The rooms are large but a bit on the dark side  It was noisy at night from the building work outside which is no fault of the hotel  All staff were very polite and helpful  Only   lifts proved tricky especially during busy hours Very handy for shopping  Good shuttle bus to Hilton Jumeirah Beach Overall a good experience  
N =>  Convenient for Airport I stayed at the hotel during the Eid holiday in uary      which also coincided with a period of mourning following the death of the late Ruler of Dubai  For one or other of these reasons the sale of alcohol in the bar was curbed  and Verre  Gordan Ramsey s restaurant  was closed as well so I did not get a chance to sample all the facilities I arrived early in the morning  The room had been booked by my wife to get hhonors points on her card but this caused a problem with check in staff who told me she could not have them as she was not with me   It is her one perk of having a travelling husband and had not caused a problem in the past at other Hilton hotels   I suggested that they gave me my own hhonors card number which they duly did  But I was put out  after a tiring flight  by their pedantic attitude  The staff may well have been right about the hhonors  rules  but their attitude was not sympathetic  I was shown up to the room straightaway without having to wait The room was nicely presented in glass and blond wood with plenty of towels  The shower was spacious with a good jet  The hand basin is set too far in on the vanity unit meaning a stretch to wash hands  The bed and pillows were comfortable  I had lunch at the Glasshouse  The mushroom soup had real mushrooms but the fishcake was overly salty with a weak nondescript sauce at the base  The mint tea came in a large pot with a non leaky spout A request for water produced a   cl bottle of Hildon which I took to my room so as not to waste   a glass of ordinary water would have been sufficient as I was by myself  Bringing a big bottle without being asked to do so indicated a lack of thoughtfulness  The internet connection in the room worked perfectly  The printer did not  I couldn t print from my laptop  Likewise the tv did not work  No doubt all these things could have been easily fixed but when you check in you expect the room to be ready and the equipment operational rather than wasting time on calls to  maintenance   I tried Issimo in the evening but got a long story about how the sandwiches had to come from room service and would take    minutes  I took this as a hint I should order room service which I did  The order taker asked me how well the tuna should be cooked  I was perplexed and said  medium   The tuna sandwich came with a pot of Tiptree s English mustard which surprised me  The room service tray was taken away promptly  I did not try the health club or swimming pool  The glass  chrome and dark fittings of the hotel did not appeal to me  I found they created a soulless atmosphere  As a business traveller I found the hotel met most but not all of my needs  If I had been a leisure visitor I would probably have felt better satisfied  The hotel is reasonable value and compares well with other similarly priced hotels in Dubai  It is also convenient for the airport  
N => Fantastic I can t fault this hotel at all  We had looked at a lot of different city hotels in Dubai and chose this one because we thought that it was reasonably priced in comparison to its rivals  We decided to opt for an executive room for our   nights in ember  as the price difference was worth it for the breakfast alone  From the minute to we met the chauffeur at the airport everything was superb  The executive lounge was brilliant   perhaps a little small  but the convenience of the refreshments  internet access and dedicated staff was very good  Our double room on the   th floor was spotless and very spacious  The bathroom was beautifully designed and was also a generous size We had breakfast in the glasshouse  every morning it was fantastic with an extensive menu of cooked options as well as the enormous buffet  We didn t get the opportunity to try dinner at the glasshouse  but I would thoroughly recommend dining in Gordon Ramsay s Verre  Everything about it was superb  the food  staff and service alike  The added bonus was that it was reasonably priced when compared to London prices        per couple including good wine I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone  it was fantastic and we felt that it offered great value for money for the standard that it provided  
N =>  Lovely view We stayed in the Hilton Dubai Creek for four nights towards the end of our Honeymoon  The hotel is very impressive and unbelievably clean  We had a lovely room with a fantastic view of the city  However the bathroom is very dark with all the black marble  We arrived at the hotel at   in the morning after an all night flight  Check in is supposed to be in the afternoon sometime but luckily for us we were shown to our room after about    minutes Food was nice but on more than one occasion the service at breakfast left a lot to be desired  Staff very slow to remove dirty dishes and to take orders for hot food  We also tried the room service  food was amazing and arrived very promptly however it took two phonecalls and over   hours for them to return to remove the tray Overall we enjoyed our stay in Hilton but wouldn t recommend it as part of your honeymoon  We had stayed in Legends in Mauritius were you got some nice romantic touches in your room to set the mood for the honeymoon  We had read that Hilton cover your bed in rose petals etc but we have to say there was no romantic touches in our room for the duration of our stay  
N => Fantastic My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon  We had told them it was our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a huge room on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the Dubai Creek  Rose petals had been scattered round the room which was a nice touch  We had dinner on our private balcony overlooking the Creek  very romantic  The room itself was huge and a bath big enough for a rugby team  TV  DVD player and stereo The glasshouse restaurant was fabulous too  we had a great meal there Only slight disappointment was the small roof top pool  which was overcrowded and we couldn t get a space around it But overall  it was brilliant   
N =>  Great place to stay on way home from Australia I stayed in this hotel on the way home to the UK from Australia as part of my honeymoon We stayed on the executive floor and as a perk of this we got complimentary transport in a chauffuer driven Mercedes to the hotel and back to the airport at the end of our   nights  Upon arrival we got taken to the executive floor and checked in the executive lounge  The room did cost a bit extra but was worth the money    We had a corner room that had floor to walk windows looking out over the river and towards the beach   although to far to see it    We arrived in Dubai at  am and because the hotel knew we were arriving  they had saved us a room to allow us to check in at such an early time   at no extra cost The staff were very accommodating and would do anything to help  The pool on the roof is also amazing Another perk of staying on the executive fllor is the use of the exec lounge all day  During the day you get complimentary sandwiches and cakes and between    pm compliemntary drinks  Basically you help yourself to beers  wines or spirits  Get there early though to make sure you get a seat   On our second night when we returned to our room  the house keeper had decorated our room with petals and lit candels around the bath  Very romantic and I got a few bonus points from the wife   Would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you didn t want to stay by the beach that is a bit of a constuction site at the moment  
N =>   STAR    Stayed here from   th    th   Absolutely out of this world We were made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived outside in the taxi staff were excellentThe hotel certainly has the  wow  factor  amp  as we stepped into our room I was immediately taken back with the fantastic view over the creek from the floor to ceiling glass windowsThe bathroom was even better  A huge bath  with a votive candle had even been lit for us  a massive walk in shower  amp  mirrors  glass  chrome  amp  black marble everywhere  There was even a duck  yeah  ok  plastic Every day after sight seeing  shopping etc  we would head up to the roof pool for a swim  amp  some relaxation   again  no complaints here  Make sure you take your camaraEven on our last day  check out was at        usually the Hotels don t want to know after check out but not at this hotel We made the most of our last day in Dubai whilst the Hotel looked after our luggage  amp  then we headed back to the hotel around      pm  amp  we were able to use the pool  amp  then shower change in privacy  amp  comfort in the GYM facilities We also booked the restaurant for our final meal in the  glasshouse    Probably one of the most best steaks I ve ever had  The service  once again  superb  Plus  if you dine on a Monday night  you can have house wine spirits as long as you are still eating  for   dirham  around   p All in all  one of the best breaks I ve ever had   amp  as for the Hotel  I wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to anyone   amp  hopefully  one day  when returning to Dubai  will definately stay here Feel free to contact me for any info you may need 
N =>  Honeymoon hotel  
N =>  Fantastic Hotel   BUT don t stay Thursdays   
N =>  Not as good as it was  
N =>  Stop over paradise  
N => Sensationeller Panoramablick in TOP   Hotel  
N => 					   good   
N =>   Great for families When we were there the hotel was full of families  It has to be said that the noise becomes overwhelming  especially after  days of screaming children everywhere  There seems to be no escape the way the hotel is made  Nevertheless all the children had a great time  The food was good but not excellent  The service was at times slow but mostly fast and friendly  
N =>   Hotel is Cutting Back We have been to this hotel on several occasions  amp  always felt we had value for money This time was not the caseThe nibbles on the bars were not out you had to ask for them or you would not get any  They have stopped serving cashews all together  The Executive lounge used to be self service hot buffet at happy hour serving chicken prawns etc   This time they served you a small portion  amp  you had to ask for more as they would not ask you The lager they served was from another room  amp  to my horror it was from CANS this is not acceptable from a   Star hotel    I had to ask for a bottle  amp  all i got was a poor bottled lager   When you have   people in your family  amp  you upgrade to executive club i dont expect to be served cans of beer if i wanted that i would have gone to Benidorm AI  Hilton need to address the little cut backs they are trying to impose whith out there guests realising BECAUSE WE DO i will NOT go back to the Hilton Again until i hear different  Was not impressed  However I would try The Atlantis on the Palm looked round it  amp  was impressed 
N =>   Superb as usual Have just returned today from our second trip to the Hilton and have to say standards remain high  We had an issue with plumbing which was sorted as quickly as possible with a complimentary meal for our trouble Upgrade to the executive lounge if you can worth every penny  
N =>   Hilton Honours  This hotel has ensured  Not Anymore for Me   Booked a one night stay here in Dubai on route from UK to Auckland  The flight was to arrive in the early hours of the morning in Dubai   so in the booking I requested an early check in if at all possible  As a silver card Honours member I thought they might do this for me  How wrong was I  They wanted me to pay for an extra night    in order to get into my room a few hours early  even though I was leaving the hotel at  am the next day Totally tired out and getting nowhere with the shift manager  I ended up paying      dirhams for less than a    hr stay   in the most impersonal HIlton I have experienced  amp  I have had better matttresses in motels  This experience has made sure I will cancel my Hilton membership when I get back to the UK and will never use a Hilton Hotel ever again If you want a great but reasonably priced hotel for a night stop in Dubai  I used for return journey  amp  it was fabulous   stay at the Metropolitan Palace Hotel  Al Maktoum St   
N =>   Fantastic hotel   would definitely recommend it  My boyfriend and I spent    hours in this hotel on our way to Hong Kong  We arrived early on Saturday morning   am ish  and we left around   the following day I am a silver HH member  which may have helped  but what was fantastic  when we checked in  was that they not only let us check in early  but also upgraded us to a suite  The suite was fantastic  Two big rooms   a bedroom and a lounge  two balconies  and a huge bathroom  The view from the bedroom was onto the swimming pool  the beach and the ocean and we could see the Atlantis and the Burj al Arab from the room  Breakfast was amazing   vast choice  including eggs cooked on demand in any way you wanted them  Went in the bar  quot Bice quot    nice and trendy  with good service  but not that cheap  The service was fantastic   literally couldn t fault it  For example  at breakfast  any time your coffee or orange was empty  they came and filled it straight away  they also kept the pool open slightly later for us to swim  and generally they were incredibly helpful  
N =>  I ve never been so relaxed and looked after  I stayed at the Hilton Jumeriah for   nights with my boyfriend  As soon as we stept out the taxi we were treated like royalty  The staff couldn t do enough to help us and even knew us on first name terms by the third day  The reception staff were extremely helpful when we wanted to extend our checkout and when our swipe card stopped working they quickly remedied this  Breakfast was fantastic and poolside was very clean  Compared to the sea the pool was chilled  Would definitely go back to Dubai and stay here  
N =>   The whole experience was fantastic  We have just returned from a seven night stay at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach Hotel   and we could not fault a single thing  From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic  they were so polite and treated us like V I P s  The hotel is ideally located right on the beach  there was some demolition work being undertaken next door  but to be honest we did not notice it  I thought I would mention it though  as I had read other reviews before we went and was worried in case it would spoil the holiday  our room was facing onto the site and we were totally unaffected by the ongoing work The whole place is spotlessly clean  the buffet breakfast kept us going until early evening  The gym was handy if you fancied a workout As with most holidays if you wanted a sunbed by the pool it was the usual get up at     am to put your towel down routine  I did this a couple of times but then went back to the sunlounger after breakfast one morning to find that someone had taken the loungers  Apparently If you do not return within one hour of putting down the towel its basically anyones for the taking  There are plenty of areas to sit in the lovely gardens and comfortable loungers on the beach too We would recommend Bice Restaurant if you like Italian food on the ground floor and the Oceana Restaurant has a different menu each evening To sum up  the hotel  staff and location were superb and we would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to visit Dubai  
N =>   Amazing Staff This hotel was amazing  The staff go out of their way to make sure you are happy  They remember your name and try to help out whenever they can Special thanks to Kris who checked us in The location is excellent right on the beach and close to restaurants and shops The only thing that I didnt like was the bed was a little hard but apart from that we had a nice sea view room which was spotless I would highly recommend not only the hotel but also the free buffet breakfast which had a great selection There was always room on the private beach and the pool is excellent to cool off in after being in the hot sea  The hotel provides beach towels and a beach butler came around with drinks The hotel had flat screen TV  tea and coffee facilities and complimentary bottled water  The hotel also has a Cuban cigar bar which was nice and a rooftop bar which again was good The gym was excellent but we didn t have time to use it much There are complimentary shuttle buses to the malls although these do get very packed and not always first come first served The taxi to the airport was about    Dirhams but from the airport to the hotel was    as they start the meter at    at the airport Overall I would highly recommend this hotel as we had a great time  
N =>  Cannot Fault   Excellent  highly recommend and although we arrived prior to the official check in time  the staff were very helpful and had our   rooms ready within an hour  Tea and coffee were served to us whilst we waited as well as a refreshing melon  welcome  drink  Would go back tomorrow         
N =>   Lovely Hotel     Star Staff   Stayed here for a week before experiencing Atlantis   separate review    We arrived around     am  amp  were greeted by numerous staff all keen to asist  directed to the check in desk  amp  supplied with a welcome drink of watermelon juice  Check in was a breeze  I left credit card details for incidentals   why do so many people have a problem with this   It s standard practice at any hotel I ve ever stayed in   Our room was ready immediately  a welcome relief after the long daybefore   amp  we were offered breakfast but we went for a hours sleep first  I had booked a sea view room but received what I would consider a side sea view   to the left a view of the walk  amp  to the right the sea   I would have prefered something overlooking the gardens or pool but no big deal   I should probably have mentioned this at check in  Rooms are typical Hilton standard  amp  comfortable   slightly disappointed that my son had a fold away bed instead of   queens but the king was huge   Breakfast buffet was good   ample fruit  fresh pancakes  waffles  breads  amp  pastries as well as cooked food including a pork station  amp  made to order omlettes but it can get busy after      am   we had to wait for   or    minutes on a couple of days but this wasn t a problem for us   pity some of the other guests didn t feel the same   I experienced one man being extremely rude because a table was not immediately available  The pool  although in my opinion it closed way too early   amp  garden areas are lovely leading to a nice stretch of beach with warm turquoise water   bliss   Never any issues with sunloungers   the ones around the pool were occupied fairly early but never a problem getting one in the gardens or on the beach  Generally food  amp  drink in the hotel is expensive   on our first afternoon   soft drinks  a kids hamburger  amp  caeser salad  no chicken  prawns or anthing   literally just lettuce  dressing  amp  parmesan  from the poolside cafe came in at around       not surprisingly it was empty most of the time  A bottle of Corona or soft drink was over     cocktails about      amp  a large bottle of water about     We had afternoon tea in Axis which came in at about        for     which wasn t too bad  I think that if the hotel prices were more reasonable more guests would use the facilities but as  quot The Walk quot  has ample eateries  incl Chilis which we frequented   amp  even a supermarket for essentials most people tend to go there  Taxi s are plentiful  amp  cheap   approx    dirhams  incl tip  to the Emirates Mall or Jumeriah Beach Hotel  amp     dirhams to Dubai Mall or Atlantis  When we were leaving to go to Atlantis the bell boy commented that we were going to the  quot expensive one quot  but in fact  I found the prices in Atlantis to be no more  amp  in some cases less than the Hilton  In summary the Hilton was a lovely comfortable hotel but the main asset of this place is the staff who are second to none across the board   they can t do enough for you   even when being confronted by rude arrogant guests   It never fails to amaze me how rude some people are   I don t think I ve ever experienced a hotel that has such consistently helpful  amp  pleasant staff  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a relaxing pool beach holiday but if returning I think from our family point of view  we would choose to stay somewhere like Jumeriah beach or Atlantis again both of which were more lively  amp  had more facilities for families  
N =>   Spot on cant wait to go again This was our first trip to Dubai and both my partner and i hope its not our last  we travelled from Birmingham and got a connecting flight from Paris Charles De Gaulle in which we had a slight delay as the plane wasn t ready for boarding  Upon arrivals at Dubai we were greeted by a Travco representative who instructed us to go through arrivals passport control before collecting our suitcases  The arrivals passport control is like all others  stand in a que until called forward  this took quite a long time as there were people trying to enter the country trying to find work  so whe nwe got through there we were again greeted by the travco rep who had collected our luggage for us  which was helpful  From collecting our luggage we made our way outside which was the  st time we experienced the heat of the United Arab Emirates in which we were told was    degrees at      am Dubai time  The transfer from airport to hotel was the best i have experienced as myself and my partner were expecting to be boarding a bus coach but instead we were greeted with an Audi A  and a Cadilac Escalade  we were given the Audi as there was only the   of us  During the trip to the hotel the driver was very informative telling us about the location we were in and telling us of places to visit and things to do  which was very helpful as we had only read about things on the internet or got told things by people who had previously visited Dubai On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the hotel staff who immediately opened the doors of the car and took out our luggage and directed us to the check in desk  upon walking through the main entrance another member of the hotel staff offered us a complimentary drink  we made our way to the check in desk in which a few forms needed to be filled in and thats when we were asked by the receptionist for a deposit of around     AED or      to cover food and drink consumed in the hotel and for items taken out of the mini bar  we told her we didn t have that on us and then we were asked for a credit card in which we replyed the same and said that we would pay for things as we go  when the forms had been filled in we were given our room card and that the mini bar would be removed and that our cases would be up to our room in a minute or so  This was the case and no sooner had we closed te door our cases were with us  and around   mins later there was another knock at the door for the mini bar to be removed  Breakfast was served between     am in the Oceana Restaurant  in which there was everything from a full english  pancakes  eggs bennedict  danish pastries and more  i would recommend the sausages   there was also a machine that was always being topped up with oranges for people to get there fresh orange juice  Drinks in the hotel were expensive but the bottled orange juice was well worth the   aed or     bottled water was   aed and cans of pop were priced at   aed  as an estimate   aed worked out at around    The pool was lovely and refreshing with the temperature perfect for the       degree heat that we were experiencing  there were changing rooms and toilets a couple of steps away from the edge of the pool  At around  pm the was a lifeguard that came around with face towels that were covered in ice and had a lemony smell to them to cool you down in the heat  although they only stayed cool for a fwew minutes when they were taken out of the bucket they were in  This also applied to the beach  Just around the corner from the pool was a little hut that kept towels for the guests and this was also the location that told you the current temperature and humidity  To get the towels you just had to give your room number and name  The beach was just a minute or so stroll from the pool in which you had to walk through the hotels garden  between the beach and pool was a restaurant shish pipe hut in which the attendant would take one down to the beach for you  On the edge of the beach there was   showers and a hose pipe for washing your feet which was lovely and refreshing  there was also a decked walk way that kept you off the scorching hot sand  The sand was white and felt soft beween your toes but also was too hot to stand on for more than a second unless you were standing on it in the shade  The water was just like getting into as bath and was never too cold to get in but on one occasion it was too hot to get in  Time to go now i hope this review is helpful for people who are travelling to this hotel in the near future and hope you enjoy your stay as much as i did  
N =>   Superb friendly amazing  This has to be one of the best run Hotels i have ever stayed in  Myself and my friends were new to Dubai  Dubai has so much to do  that without some local knowledge i felt it would have been easy to miss some local gems to visit So on the first day i sat down with the Krish on the front desk hoping he would write down a few must sees  It was an indicator of the level of staff excellence  he spent over an hour writing down places to eat  visit  pubs restaurants prices etc etc  Then each day asking how we got on  were they good recommendations  It just was a small but indicative sign of a superbly run Hotel One bit of advice given to me was to upgrade to the executive rooms with access to the  th floor for drinks and snacks this was extremely worthwhile and good value Overall Dubai is a fairytale place it more than lived up to expectations and having a friendly clean and efficient Hotel added immensely to a great holiday  
N =>  Stayed here for our honeymoon and loved it  We were originally booked to stay at the Sheriton also on Jumeirah Beach  however when we arrived they told us the pool was going to be closed for our whole stay due to renovations  This really put a dampner on our long saved for honeymoon  After some serious complaining we were moved to the Hilton  We could not have been happier  There is nothing I dislike about this hotel  The pool is lovely and the beach is the perfect place to watch the sun go down  The breakfasts are superb as well  We were staying during Ramadan so perhaps we had the hotel when it s slightly quieter  But all in all I would go back there tomorrow if I could  
N =>  Check in nightmare The reason why I booked this chain was it offered the best price for its brilliant location  The location was great not only because it was on Jumeriah Beach but also across the road was a street called THE WALK this had numerous restaurants which offered amazing variety and better quality food than the hotel  there is also a supermarket on the upper level  On checking in the hotel swiped my credit card for approximately      when I questioned this I was told it was  In case I used room service quot  as you can imagine I was livid because I had not been informed about this and this left me with no use for my credit card for the holiday  I was going to get it back when I checked out but it was the principle of the matter does the credit crunch not mean anything to the Hilton    To make matters worse I was informed my room was not ready  this is not what you want to hear after a   hour flight and its  am  I had to wait about an hour and even then I was told this was a temporary disabled room and I would be moved the following day  I was not pleased but too tired to argue because it was nearly  AM by this time  When I eventually got to my temporary room I could not even use the shower as it was too low down and it was fixed so I went to bed feeling grotty The next morning I went down to reception to see if my room was ready and I was told it would not be ready till after  pm  as you can imagine I was fuming  I calmed myself down and to make matters worse they did not even offer me anything for the inconvenience so I had to ask  I asked for a free upgrade and I was told they could not do this as fully booked  so I said to staff are you not going to offer me anything  The staff I feel reluctantly gave me free dinner and soft drinks for two at their cheapest buffet restaurant  I told them I was on my honey moon  amp  disappointed in their service  Staff said they would send up a cake as a gift   this did not arrive for another two days and then it only came because I had to go and ask staff again  quot where is my gift quot  absolutely ridiculous  The food in their Oceana restaurant was terrible  it was a cheap luke warm buffet with not enough variety When I eventually got to my permanent room it was of a good standard  nice spacious size  i had booked the deluxe seaview room  the balcony was of a good size and I could see the sea partially the other half of the view was the building site next door where they were bulldozing down a old building  it was noisy but bearable  when you were inside the room you could not hear any noise from the demolition because the balcony doors are soundproofed  thank goodness  The buffet breakfast was nice and had a good variety and staff provided excellent service Despite the checking in nightmare  it is a good hotel  a bit boring  staff are very helpful and work very hard  the rooms are nice and very clean  I would recommend it to a friend  
N =>  Construction chaos and dust     We booked   seaview rooms   standing on our balconys  and craining our necks we could see the sea   otherwise  a beautiful view of carparks  and buildings under construction  I think the hotel would have been lovely    years ago  but now does not fit the Hilton standard at all  All the construction next door meant clouds of dust  and noise  so our pool experience lasted only minutes  before we dived inside for fresh air  Rooms   there were huge  large bathrooms  great bed   could not fault them  Check In   staff were friendly and helpful  although even though check in was at  pm  we had to wait more than   hours hours for our room  Staff were apologetic  but there was nothing they could do  and they did not offer anything in way of compensation except a cup of coffee  Really poor considering we had been on a long haul flight  and all we wanted to do was sleep  and we had pre paid our room   it should have been ready at  pm  not nearly  pm Breakfasts   everything you could ask for   heaps of variety  and friendly staff  who bent over backwards to help  
N =>   Great hotel Great Location Arrived at hotel early but into room straight away staff could not do enoughfor you  breakfast was superb we loved position of hotel on the beachor great gardens to sit in   you only had to walk out of hotel and you were on  quot The Walk  quot  lots of nice restaurants taxi s were cheap really recommedthe  quot Friday Brunch  quot  normally includes all food and drink  good value They are knocking hotel down next door but did not cause us any problems 
N =>  bit disappointing I stayed for   nights whilst attending a work conference  The Hilton was adequate but nothing special  The rood top bar was ok and the meal we had in the Argentinian restuarant excellent even if the service was a little stuffy with   waitresses basically having a fight over who was going to make us our fresh guacamole  The rooms were disappointingly dull  Ok just dull  The pool was quite small and pool bar closed very early in the evening  I have stayed in other better places in Dubai but as I wasn t paying it wasn t worth worrying about  The building work going on around the hotel is very intrusive  Lots of dust and noise from very early in the morning  
N =>   Almost great First time I ve stayed here and overall it s the best place we ve stayed in Dubai  That said  the reception staff are pretty dire  I booked an executive room so should have been checked in on the executive floor   wasn t possible for some unspecified reason  A portly Egyptian manager was rude and obnoxious  not to us but to the couple next to us and to the staff trying to help them We had a problem with no hot water in the sink but when we called to report it our Egyptian friend told me it wasn t a problem  Three calls later and I got hold of the duty manager who sent an engineer who fixed it in    seconds   about an hour after we first called The Pachanga restaurant was great  Bice much overated  
N =>   A Perfect Stay We stayed in HDJ for one week from ch    to ch     We only have good things to say about this hotel  The staff and the facility of this hotel are truly   stars  Special thanks to Adel Ashry  Guest Service Manager  He went out of his way to insure that we had a great stay in this hotel  
N =>  Reception staff are a disgrace at this Hotel  This hotel was meant to be part of a dream holiday to Dubai  amp  South Africa  I chose this specific hotel for it s beach side location in particular  I booked an Executive Room through Expedia and assumed that this would be a superior room to a standard and would have a decent view  The hotel reception staff at this hotel were absolutely awful  they allocated us a room overlooking the hotel being demolished next door  amp  a Tower block  On requesting a different room away from the construction  amp  with a partial or sea view  we were told that because we had booked via Expedia  amp  not through Hilton direct we were only allowed a Tower View Room  I argued with them that I had simply booked an Executive room via Expedia and it did not specify either a sea view or Tower View  I had incidentally put a special request of a sea view on my expedia booking  obviously I am aware that special requests will be considered but not guaranteed  Had my booking stated this room has a Tower View I would have had no complaint but it did not  They also said it was because I d booked late  again I argued that I hadn t as I d booked a couple of months ago  The hotel reception were simply not interested in our disappointment at having to look at a Tower Block which looked like something out of Benidorm  very depressing  see pics   How strange also that our Executive Room was very small in size  amp  did not even have a writing desk in it which is what you would expect from an executive room  Our frustration was made even worse as we walked along the corridors and saw the sea view rooms which had beautiful views  The receptionist said the hotel was full  amp  they couldn t move us  if they had a sea view room available they said we could have paid the extra  I was gobsmacked by this as to why we should have to pay extra  At no point did the reception staff go out of their way to assist us  as far as they were concerned because we had paid upfront via Expedia for the room we were not a concern  hardly service reflective of a   star hotel  I argued with the receptionist and told him that all guests should be given equal consideration whether they book with Hilton direct or through another company such as Expedia  why should Expedia customers be penalised and treated  nd rate  Our annoyance was further compounded when in the lift we spoke to a couple who had moved rooms  this was just after we were told they were full  amp  couldn t move us  I would never book with Hilton as I think the treatment of their guests is unfair  amp  shoddy  The hotel was also reluctant to give me a guest questionnaire to complete at the end of my stay  are they trying to hide something I wonder  I had to speak to the reception manager just to obtain a guest questionnaire  they clearly don t want negative comments  They had posted a letter under my door the day before check out which stated a guest questionnaire was enclosed  I had a terrible time trying to get this from them for some reason  the manager said he thought I d rather email my comments  I told him I would be doing that as well  This was further noted in the Hotel sports bar whereby on receiving my drinks bill  the bar man had already completed the guests comments sheet enclosed with the bill  needless to say he d awarded himself excellent in every area  what a joke  The staff in the executive lounge were very good  amp  a big contrast to those staff on reception who need some training on customer service  The food  amp  drinks available in the Executive lounge were very good  amp  the staff very pleasant  The attitude of the reception staff  amp  their lack of effort in assisting us left us very dis satisfied and the awful depressing room totally ruined what probably would have been a very enjoyable stay  
N =>   Great Room was fantastic with view of the beach which unfortunatly was all we saw for three days as suffering from food poison which we got in Egypt  Room service was good lived on corn soup which I can recomend  Managed to get to the beach on last night was so warm and clean  do intend to go back just love the country  Taxi at the door not expensive to take you where you want  staff at shopping center were very helpfull  Hotel very busy and you may have to wait a while before they can attend to you which is a bit of a pissoff as you pay top dollar  Swimming pool packed all day dont bother  just hit the beach  Thank god it was a big comfy bed as we spent so much time in it  do not switch air conditioner off  unlike Australia it does not cool down at night  
N =>   Brlliant Hotel with friendly helpful staff  Would recommend This was our first trip to Dubai and the hotel was recommended through Airmiles  We had a warm welcome on arrival  Check in is at     pm but our early flight meant we were there at  am  The staff had our room ready in twenty minutes  They had left a lovely birthday cake in our room to celebrate my husbands birthday which was a great surprise  All of the staff are helpful and kind  The new developement of  quot the walk quot  with restaurant and shop adds to the appeal of the hotels location  As with everywhere in Dubai there is construction work in the area but you would not notice any noise or interference  We would really recommend staying here and look forward to returning  
N =>   Brilliant   nights stopover on the way to OZ  couldn t fault the Hilton in any way  we were upgraded to a suite on arrival  breakfeast was amazing  staff were friendly  amp  helpful  we will be booking again later this year for a weeks holiday  we just couldn t fault the place   
N =>   Excellent Hotel This hotel was everything we expected  The service was excellent  concierge very  very helpful  The breakfast was good  Room very nice  The only downside to this hotel is the construction work but I think you would expect that in any hotel in Jumeriah Beach  Would use this hotel again next time  
N =>  do not stay here Please  please do not stay here  I went with my mum for a  mum and daughter  getaway in ember       We were told our room wasn t ready  therefore were given a room to freshen up in and were told we could change later  We had paid extra for an upgraded room  We ended up having to move rooms three times and were still not given the room we paid for  The receptionists were completely rude and unhelpful and couldn t quite work out that a mother and daughter were on holiday together without a man in tow  The room was basic in my opinion  to say this is a four five star hotel  To cap it all  obviously they took our credit card details for incidentals  when we checked out  we actually paid cash and were told our credit card wouldn t be charged  Surprise  surprise  it has been  despite phone calls  and many emails  we are still doing battle with this hotel to get our money back  Shoddy service from the Hilton chain  I wouldn t stay here again at all  
N =>   Great Stopover We needed a place to relax for   days on our way home to NZ from the UK   we chose this hotel after reading other reviews on all Jumeirah beach hotels in our price range  The Hilton Jumeirah Beach was brilliant   we paid a little extra for the  quot executive quot  option  but was worth it as it gave access to the Executive Lounge for quieter breakfasts and evening drinks  free   Be aware a couple of the bars allow smoking  but there are areas where you can have a drink in a smoke free environment  The staff were helpful and courteous   we would stay here again  
N =>  Nice Hotel This was our second stay at this hotel  Our first time   it was less crowded and we had a very nice weekend  We were upgraded to a suite and certainly enjoyed it This time   when we first arrived  they couldn t find our room  They finally provided us with a one bed room  we had kids with us   and we sort of  quot camped quot  for the night  The following day  when my husband expressed his disappointment to the front desk  they moved us to a  quot double double quot  room on the executive floor  as well as cut the cost  The service was excellent  The staff seem to always be there at your service  Breakfast was great  My kids loved the  quot mickie mouse ears quot  on their pancakes  Nice touch  I thought  Huge variety  Even the OJ was freshly squeezed in front of you  The dinners was very nice too  but then each day is a different cuisine  and sometimes you may not enjoy the selection  this happened to us on the  quot Arabic quot  night on Thursday   as we are vegetarians Hilton probably would need to eventually expand their pool area  There are too many people cooking in that pool together     Many have already mentioned the lack of sunbeds   we could never get one  I was a little disappointed at the chidren s area at the beach  The children s playground area was completed messed up at   am  the water table was cracked and had no water  When I asked the staff member to fix it for my kid  he acted like he was doing me a special favor  and also tried to explain that everything was broken  It kinda looked like a garage sale there   Overall  however  this was a very good experience  and it is truly a Hilton with all its ambiance  We just happened to b there when it was very crowded  You may also try Dubai ina Beach Resort  many pools there   and Habtour  sp    The last one hs great kids pool slide area  and an extra pool at a different floor level  
N =>  Heven on earth This was heven on earth  We arrived in the afternoon  the heat hits you when you leave the airport to get in you ac people carrier  you get complementy ice cold water and cold flannels which was great  When we went building work was beeing done outside the hotel but once you enter the hotel you cannot hear any thing  You are treated like royalty from the time you enter to the time you leave  Our room was buetiful Breakfast was served till    would come down at        I am not a breakfast perosn but the breakfast was delicoues  everything was made infront of uou fresh even orange juice  was amazed at the variety of food especially if you are a vegaterian  The pool area it great   lots of places to sit down on  We went injuly just before the kiddies holidays  the sand is so hot you cannot walk on it  The sea was lovaly warm and clean  the beach was spotless  Because of the heat we spent the afternoon at the hotel  and went out late afternoon  The shops open till very late and that is not food shops all sorts clothing electronics anything  This was a mum and daughter trip we felt very safe travelling at night in the taxies  They are all registered  so no problem  
N =>  Beautiful hotel We normally stay at the Hilton Dubai Creek but we thought we d try this one for a change  it s also cheaper   We arrived very late at night after our flight was delayed and were shown to a room  We were very disappointed as we had booked a suite but we were tired and just flopped into bed  In the morning we queried our booking and were eventually moved to our suite with the sincere apologies of the staff  This room was fantastic and the hotel itself is beautiful  The beach area looked very nice but unfortunately it rained almost all the time we were there and didn t get the use of the beach or the pool  We ate in a few nights and the food was very good and reasonably priced  If we went back to Dubai we would probably go back here as opposed to Dubai Creek  
N =>  Just OK It is very hard to pick a hotel in Dubai but we settled on a beach location and a not too crazy price  So to be honest I was not surprised that this hotel is just OK  There are so many new hotels so in comparison this one probably is a little dated but it is not bad  If we went to Dubai again we would pay more and stay at one of the Madinat Jumeirah hotels  People worried about the building work   do not fear   we had no disruption at all  
N =>   Superb from start to finish We booked the Executive Plus room which included airport pick up and return  After an overnight flight and clearing the immegration queue it was a welcome sight to be greeted by the hotel driver and taken to the car  BMW   series with a welcome cool interior and cold bottled water  We quickly arived at the hotel which like so much in Jumeriah Beach is suurounded by ongoing building  Even though we arrived at      am and out room wasnt ready yet  we were quickly checked in and shown to the Executive Lounge where we were invited to enjoy breakfast  Believe me it was a welcome invitation as the breakfast on the Virgin flight left a lot to be desired  even in upper Class Within an hour our room was ready   Spacios clean and smelling fresh  The houskeeping staff introduced themselves and reminded us that anything we needed was only a phone call away  Everyevening we had a turndown service including fresh towels and replacement of any of the toiletries used  The room was always cleaned to a high standard throughout our stay The staff within the Hotel were always friendly and welcoming and nothing appeared to be any trouble  Such a welcoming change from some other hotels  The executive Lounge provides   in addition to breakfast  afternoon tea  great scones   and evening canapees  Well worth the extra you pay  agaimn the small team in the lounge got to know you quickly and always welcomed you Everything within the hotel was good  guest comfort and feel good factor being important to all the staff  The beach was clean and sunbeds were always comfortable  its so nice to be escorted to a sunbed and the towels laid out for you  Security staff on the beach quickly moved on any  quot univited onlookers quot  and you felt safe at all times  no hawkers trying to sell you their wares Will certainly use this hotel again when returning to Dubai  yes its on Jumeriah beach with building work going on around you but even so there is no noise to disturb your relaxation  the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle bus into the Malls and Gold Souk where yoiu can wander around comfortably and safely On leaving the return via hotel transportation was on time and so comfortable  The only time we touched our cases was on arrival in the airport and on departure from the hotel vehicle again at the airport All in all a wonderful hotel to stay at and I woudl recommend it to everyone 
N =>  Perfect start to a honeymoon This hotel was the first stop on our honeymoon and we certainly weren t disappointed The bedroom was very well appointed  with all the usuals you would expect from a Hilton   TV  robes  comfortable double bed  lush carpet  balcony overlooking the sea  the breakfast was amazing  probably the best I ve had anywhere Our travel agent hadn t informed the hotel we were on honeymoon  which wasn t too much of an issue  but after letting the reception know when we arrived we were treated like royalty  getting a room upgrade and a lovely hand decorated chocolate cake There is a lot of construction going on outside the hotel  but you don t hear anything in the bedroom as soon as you close the balcony door  you won t want it open as you need the air conditioning   and the building work is constant  rather than intermittent so it turns into background noise that doesn t grate at all The pool was beautifully clean  but quite busy  especially when they closed much of the grassed area one day for a wedding  The beach was gorgeous  wear flipflops   the sand burns   and the sea better than the pool   it was so warm it was like swimming in a bath You can take a taxi into town  it takes about    mins but its much more relaxing than driving yourself  which seems to be a bit of a lottery  cars overtaking in all lanes  and turning right from all lanes too    You can also go to the other resorts  shopping mall  skiing and on a desert jeep safari if you like to keep busy Theres a lot to do in Dubai  We stayed for   days but would have preferred a bit longer to get to rest a bit between all the activities we did  Overall though  a fantastic first stop on the honeymoon   We ll definately make a point of stopping there again  
N =>  Agree with prevoius review Just returned from a weeks stay at this Hilton  stayed in exec  rooms which are certainly worth the extra  As with the review by JJJ  we would happily recommend this to other travellers  This was our  th time   st in this hotel  and will book again for later this year   
N =>   Outstanding hotel with exceptional service We stayed at this hotel from          as part of our honeymoon  This was our first trip to the Hilton and to Dubai  From the moment we arrived we received outstanding service  We arrived at the hotel around  am and our room was ready about an hour later  even though we had not requested early check in  As soon as we walked in to the hotel someone came around with a well needed refreshing drink  We went down to the Wavebreaker restaurant for a snack  This restaurant is right on the beach  The menu is the same as ordering from the beach  everything we ordered was good  but after a week seemed a little limited  By the time we were done with our snacks and drinks  our room was ready  We were very impressed with our room  We had read the reviews on tripadvisor  so we were prepared for the views of construction work  but it to be honest it did not bother us at all  We had a delux room with a partial ocean view  which was lovely  Most of the construction is over now  and our view of the beach was just fine  Because we were on our honeymoon they sent us a delicious chocolate cake with  quot Happy Honeymoon quot  on it  a card and a bottle of champagne  Every day they sent fresh fruit and boxes of chocolates  I m not sure if everyone got this or it was just because we were on our honeymoon  The beach was beautiful  it was very crowded the week we were there and every sunbed was taken  but the guys working on the beach went and got one for you right away if there was none available  The service on the beach was great  despite it being so busy  You just had to look up and someone would run over to take your order  We went swimming in the ocean a few times  which was so clean despite all the construction going on  The pool was kind of disappointing  it is completely in the shade  and in  and  it was cold  although I m sure it is nice during the summer months  The swim up bar was nice and the water was very clean  but as previous posters have noted  it isn t anything special and most people were on the beach  The free shuttle to Mall of the Emirates  souks  etc is great  But make sure you sign up the day before and beware  the bus driver does not wait for anyone  so be ready and waiting to go  We found it easy to get taxi s from the hotel  but make sure to allow plenty of time to allow for traffic  On one night we almost missed our reservation at a restaurant because we were stuck in traffic for almost an hour We ordered room service a couple of times  This was great  they had quite an extensive room service menu  and everything arrived promptly  exactly as we had ordered and hot  BICE   the Italian restaurant in the hotel was good  The food was amazing  but the service left quite a bit to be desired  Our waitress was clearly inexperienced  She was attentive to the point of being annoying  she rushed to take our order  all the food came one course after the next  We were in and out within an hour  which for the price we were paying for the meal was disappointing  The BiCE Sky Bar was great  The views were amazing and it has a very romantic atmosphere  I would recommend booking if you want an outside table  especially later in the evening as it is quite busy  The new years eve celebration was fantastic  all the staff worked so hard  The decorations looked fabulous  the buffet was delicious and the whole evening was really magical  They constructed a dance floor down by the beach  they had a live DJ  and there was a bonfire and fireworks  The hotel staff really made it a special evening  we had a great time  By the time we made it to breakfast the next morning  there was not a trace of the evening before  they had cleaned up everything all through the night  Truly Incredible Spa   my husband went for a full body massage  which he reported was amazing  So relaxing and well worth the money  We found that the prices were about the same as you would pay in Europe or in the US  Just some other side notes  not related to the hotel   I would definately recommend going to the Madinat Jumeirah complex  you cannot believe it until you see it  As previous posters had noted  there are several good restaurants and quite reasonably priced    I would also recommend Gordon Ramsey s restaurant Verre Creek at the other Hilton  Hilton Dubai Creek  I emailed the hotel to make reservations about   months before  The meal was one of the best we ve ever had  definately recommend going there    The souks were fun  but we didn t find things to be that cheap  even after bargaining  Some of the spices are worth buying  We had heard that the souks were lively in the evening  so went around  pm and thought we would make a night of it  Unfortunately  most of the souks closed around   or   and we were unable to find anywhere to eat besides street vendors which looked a bit dodgy    The Jumeirah masjid  mosque  tour which was conducted by the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding was excellent  Very interesting and very well done  I would thouroughly recommend this    We booked a desert safari through the hotel  I believe it was through a company called Planet  not sure though  They ended up showing up an hour and half late  by which time we decided we did not want to go  The hotel was very apologetic about the whole situation  and even sent a bottle of wine to our room with their apologies  We spoke to some people went with Arabian Adventures and they had a great time  so maybe this is a better company to book with   Overall we had a wonderful experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone  The staff were so hardworking and friendly  the service was outstanding  the facilities were clean and beautifully designed  the restaurants were reasonably priced for a    hotel  almost everything about our holiday was outstanding  We would definately return to the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah  
N =>   Wonderful What an amazing place  service exceptional  could not do enough to help you  Food in Hotel was very good  Pool excellent  gym facilities etc  The only problem was the building work and road works  although its everywhere you look in dubai  The room was not as big as I expected  but very clean and bright  The shuttle bus runs everyday from      until late evening  apart from Fridays when it only runs in the afternoon  Taxis are very cheap  and are imediate  
N =>   Outstanding  I stayed at the Hilton Jumierah in e       and cannot fault the hotel at all My room wasn t ready when I arrived so I was deposited in the bar area while I waited to check in  and when I got to my room I was sure there had been some sort of mistake   the room was so beautiful I was sure I had been upgraded  which it turned out I hadn t  All rooms have a balcony with a super view of the Arabian Gulf  The beach is a better option then the pool  which gets busy  Staff are always on hand to fetch a drink etc  Apart from the beautiful decor  the staff are what really makes this hotel great  They are perfectly trained  attentive without being intrusive  and all somehow managed to remember my name  When your taxi pulls up outside  your shopping is whisked away from you and you are followed to your room to deposit it  Everything was spotless  attention to detail was great  and I cannot see ANY reason to stay anywhere else in Dubai  including the Burj al Arab at three times the price  
N =>  Very nice hotel Stayed here over New Year  This was our   th attempt to get in at a hotel in Dubai  From the moment we arrived we were treated like kings  The staff made a fuss of our daughter all the while  Constantly supplying her with balloons  A colouring book  amp  crayons  We were put in a room sea facing on the  st floor which was very nice  However when we opened the door to the balcony we were above the hotel cooling system that hummed quite loudly  So we asked to be moved  amp  were given a new room immediately with views over the pool sea  The pool is mainly in the shade all day  The beach was spotless  amp  service on the beach efficient  People seemed to get up early in a dash down th save the front row sun beds  But there was always beds further back free all day  The breakfast buffet was adequate  The Bice restaurant was very good  The Gala New years eve dinner party was very good  They spent all day decorating  amp  setting up the dining area which looked fabulous  Then there was music dancing on the beach with a bonfire  I would reccommend this hotel  We didnt use the childrens club but had a look in  amp  it was very clean  There was a games room for older kids with a play station  amp  other computer thingys Taxis   constant taxis available except about    pm in the evening when the have a shift change The hilton is not the best hotel in Dubai and looks like a typical Hilton however the staff made it exceptional  
N =>   Fantastic Hotel friendly staff What more can I say about this hotel other than FANTASTIC  everything  from the rooms  to the breakfast to the friendly staff made it a pleasure to stay at the hilton  fully recomended to anyone  fantastic place to stay in dubai  
N =>   A first rate efficient and comfortable hotel We had an excellent couple of days on our way out to New Zealand  The staff were extremely efficient Our room was spacious  spotlessly clean with a half sea view When we saw all the cranes around we assumed it would be very noisy but in fact the room was perfectly soundproofed and there was no disturbance whatso ever 
N =>   Loved this Hotel My husband and I have just returned fom a very enjoyable and relaxing stay at this fabulous hotel  We stayed for   nights in an executive room  It was well worth paying the extra for such an enjoyable experience  We arrived early on Wednesday morning and our room was not ready but we were directed to the executive lounge  where we were made very welcome and much effort put into ensuring our room would be ready within the hour  The hotel staff really were some of the most courteous people we have had the good fortune to meet  The La Panga restaurant  well worth a visit  particularly on Wednesday evenings  where one can sit and watch the experts give tango lessons to all brave enough to hit the dance floor  We also enjoyed the treatments at the spa and spent many an hour just relaxing on sunbeds on the beach  Highly recommend this hotel  
N =>   Best hotel   EVER Stayed in the Hilton for   nights in y before travelling onto Thailand The whole stay from start to finish was just first class    and I really didn t want to leave    If I was ever going back to Dubai  I wouldn t stay anywhere else   
N =>   Fantastic  Absolutely amazing  the staff are so nice  cannot do enough for you  Breakfast is good as are Bice bar restaurant and the latino restauran  can t remember what it is called   Lovely pool and beach  rooms are great with air con too  which trust me  you will need   Lots of things to do   wish we had gone for   weeks really as didn t get to do the city tour  gold souk etc  Also you can visit  the world  they have built etc  which I would loved to have done but is quite expensive  Really wanted to go for afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab as well but also didn t have time for this  Apparently meals there are extremely expensive so some peple try to go for afternoon tea just to see what it is like as it is a   star hotel with it s own helicopter pad  Went to waterpark  not booked with rep just went by ourselves    total rip off    Cost so much to get in and even though the rides are good and we had a lot of fun  also didn t have to queue too much which was good  but there aren t many rides there to be honest   We did the desert safari   great night out  well worth doing  Also went to mall of the emirates   if you like shopping  go here   Also has an indoor ski slope withe real snow   Went for dinner on a dhow boat as well which was really nice  People very friendly  resort is great  we had a massve building site view from our window but heard no noise  couldn t see anything from the pool and we weren t in our room enough to complain about seeing the building work anyway   we could see the sea as well so we didn t care   Booked through Virgin   reps left a little to be desired and after being up for over    hours  our night flight was slightly delayed  we had to wait for our room to be made ready for us  We sat in a bar just off reception  our rep never turned up and had sent a message to our room to say he was ill  although of course we weren t in there so were not able to receive the message  Anyway  we finally caught up with him and booked some trips  Overall would definitely go again  to this hotel as well  We really enjoyed it and it is without a doubt the best holiday we have had in the last   years  Also I am vegetarian and found it much easier to eat here than I have anywhere esle we have been  and was therefore able to sample many more restaurants etc  Last tip   sit outside at Bice bar right on top of the hotel for a drink and enjoy the view    
N =>   It does exactly what it says on the tin  We stayed at this hotel in ust      and enjoyed it so much we had to go again  The return visit was probably the best holiday we have ever had We went for two weeks from  rd y this time and i have to say compared to      it was not as busy   probably because schools colleges haven t finished for the Summer holidays Quite simply it s down to the staff who are mainly Philipino Indian Pakistani who simply can t do enough for you   clearly Hilton give them some form of bonus if say for example you mention they provided good service in one of the  quot guest questionnaires quot  you are asked to complete at restaurants etc   We went with Virgin Atlantic Premium Economy this time and my family and i all thought this was worth the money   nearly seven hours flying is a long time and last year i thought Economy was a bit cramped to say the least  The holiday was booked through Dreamticket com who were very competitive    we saved nearly a       on what Virgin holidays and other agents were charging Again we booked an Executive sea view room     the one we were allocated on arrival only had a small bed for our son who is    so we politely asked if another room was available   we were told we could be allocated another room the following day  I mentioned that we had been told that if a suite was available we might be upgraded and the following day we were moving to a superb suite on the  th floor along the corridor from the Executive club  The room was perfect for us    plenty more space   two balconies and a large bathroom  The housekeepers really looked after us     extra bottles of water when we needed them    impeccable cleanliness fresh towels etc       i know these are things you should be able to rely on but in some hotels the simple things are not always done    our experience with the Hilton is whilst it s not a glitzy as some of the other Jumeirah hotels  quot It does exactly what it says on the tin quot    the brand delivers  In particular we love the Executive club especially during the Happy hour between  pm     pm   Mylin and her team really do look after you and it s a great way to start the evening off with a few drinks and nibbles It was our wedding anniversary whilst we were there and being the romantic fool i am i had previously sent a card and a gift on to the Hilton to be handed to my wife at a special meal i d booked at BICE   Originally i had visions that they would simply put the card and gift in its original packaging for my wife to open but as you can see from the photo the gift was placed on a plate of rose petals    great attention to detail by the Hilton staff  The meal at BICE was superb and not overly expensive  A few days prior to the BICE meal we d already had a chocolate cake from the hotel     and a bottle of bubbly and strawberries delivered to our room    i was in the superb hotel gym nearly every day in the afternoon just to keep the calories under control I also had a couple of massage treatments carried out by Eric who is excellent and for     a time bizarrely you feel absolutely great when he s mangled your body    Last year we didn t visit the Burj but my son had expressed an interest in  quot having a look  round quot  so we booked a buffet meal at Al Iwan   the buffet cost     Dirhams each and you could have as much as you wanted    the food was excellent  I love seafood and i could have spent the whole night gorging myself on the caviar lobster crab mussels etc   etc     see the photo i ve posted   After the seafood i tried just about everything and was well and truly stuffed when out of the blue the waiter delivered another chocolate cake to us    i don t knowhow they knew it was our wedding anniversary    as we were full from the meal they put the cake in a box for us to take back to our hotel    a fantastic evening  I d also booked a Lincoln Tuxedo stretch limo to take us to from the Burj    you ve got to do it in style         were excellent here and even took us to Palm Island and Dubai ina to have a look and take photos before and after  cost     The only concerns i have about this hotel   which isn t the fault of the hotel itself  is what will the beach area become like once the apartments of Jumeirah beach residence are occupied  There was certainly more  quot rubbish quot  on what is normally a very clean beach and i think the question is  quot Can the infrastructure cope with this quot Back to work on Monday but great memories of a very restful holiday    thanks to the Hilton  
N =>   Really Nice Place To stay Well after finally deciding on Dubai as our holiday destination  next came the hotel at which to stay at  After listening to dozens of people going on and on about Dubai being a building site  amp  that wherever you stay  you ll be covered in dust  amp  debris  we simply cast that to one side   chose this hotel  amp  went for it Well  I m very glad we did  OK there s no getting away from the building work that s going on   there really is tons  amp  tons  BUT  once we d checked in to the hotel  amp  were on Jumeirah beach sampling a couple of cocktails   I couldn t hear or see the building works going on  As for the hotel   it was great   we booked through Lastminute  amp  chose the executive option for a small amount of money more  Turned out to be the best thing ever  not only was the exec room great   we had free use of an exec lounge where breakfast was included  afternoon tea  amp  cakes if you wanted it  amp  from  pm to     pm FREE drinks  amp  h ors d eorvs   Nibbles   Well worth it  Basically just go   the place is great with loads to do  we even went snowboarding  in the snow dome by the mall of the emirates  It was great  amp  for     each we had   hours of boarding  amp  the wife had a lesson chucked inaswell  It Was surreal looking at the shoppers in shorts  amp  t shirts   whilst we were boarding in Minus    To sum up  eating in the hotel can be expensive   but not so different from other   star hotels around the world  pool  amp  beach area were nice  staff were super friendly  amp  we d definately go again  
N =>   hilton we very much enjoyed our stay at the hilton we did have to change rooms to the pool side of the hotel which was a little less noisy lots of construction going on around the hilton and most of dubai we found it quite intersting to watch but we where aware of it before booking would not of been happy otherwise staff at hotel great rooms kept v clean ate at bice excellent pachanga ok weather v hot  amp  lots of jelly fish in sea we were told they would sting but not dangerous so did not put us off   thought shops were dearer than uk then we were told to try karma FAKES galore our    yr old daughter thought she was in heaven but haggle  would like to go back maybe in   yrs time when the construction might have calmed down   
N =>   A Holiday at George Wimpys building site We have just returned from Perth  and the north west  It was great  we then traveled all through malaysia to penang then over to the lovely island of Langkawi  We have been there three times now  On our return to the UK we thoght we would spend a few days in Dubai  Oh my god  we stayed there   hours and decided to get an early flight back  I have never seen such a dreadful mess and construction in all my life  Tower cranes and dust everywhere  Thankfully we did manage to get the next flight home and we are so pleased we did Keith and y Chilvers 
N =>   fantastic holiday after reading some of the reviews we were a bit worried about the building work going on all around the hotel but as soon as we got to the hotel our minds were put to rest the hotel was fantastic the staff were all very helpful there is a lot of building going on everywhere in dubai but not once did it bother us it was in fact one of the best holidays that we have been on 
N =>   WAS NOT BE DISAPPOINTED Met my son in Dubai following his gap year in Australia and thought he deserved a bit of luxury   we were not disappointed  From our pre arranged early check in the staff were friendly and helpful  Our sea view room was more building site than sea  but this did not spoil our stay   we hardly heard anything despite their early start  You cannot help but notice the building going on but the hotel is in such a great position right on that lovely beach it really does not matter  The rooms had everything we needed   the almighty kettle  well stocked bathroom  comfy beds  all very clean and nicely decorated  Breaky was superb   the guy was even making micky mouse shaped pancakes for the kids  The highlight for us was walking through the stunning pool area and down the path to the fab beach   greeted by the guy with our towels who gave us a sunbed with umbrella and someone else came round with cold drinks icecreams etc  We recommend the fruit smoothies   also try the camel ride on the beach  Choice of pool bars serving drinks food snacks etc  We pre booked the free bus shuttles which we took to the shopping malls a couple of nights  Every shop you can think of  ski slope should that be your thing  cinemas  variety of food halls  Shuttle back to the hotel and had drinks in the bar  We booked a limmo back to the airport   get there with time to spare as the duty free is worth looking at  Having stayed at a    city hotel previously  this is definitely worth the extra   very relaxing  
N =>  Not at all impressed  I was severely disappointed in this hotel  It is surrounded by contruction works and most of the rooms overlook building sites  Even when I paid extra for a  quot sea view quot  room all I got was a sliver of water viewed sideways across a building site  Forget about making yourself the centre of attention for hundreds of building workers if you dared to go out on the balcony  The room was small and not up to    standard at all  The bathroom smelled of damp and the air conditioning didn t work  the latter was fixed eventually   The pool and beach are lovely  albeit small  However  they are open to external members of the leisure club and were overrun with locals and expats  The worst experience was being forcibly ejected from my sunlounger because some local club member and his family wanted to take over half of the poolside  I was treated very much as a second class citizen which peeved me no end The breakfast restaurant staff were rude  moving me from the table I had chosen to a small table in a musty corner near the kitchen because I dared to be dining alone   The restaurant was not nearly full and there was no need to do so   On the upside the food was nice and the other staff were friendly  but I will not be back in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone  There are far better options for the money  
N =>   Incompetence and mediocrity Adverse    My wife and I arrived late at night with our three children  having pre booked two connecting rooms  Upon arrival we were told that connecting rooms were not available but to come back to reception later in the day and we would be moved as the connecting rooms had been blocked for us We returned as requested but were told to again return two hours later  We did so only to be told to go back  pack our belongings and wait on phone confirmation that the rooms had been cleaned  We were then told half an hour later that no connecting rooms were available and to instead pack our belongings the following day as the rooms would become available then  The supervisor at reception even had the cheek to suggest that I was lying when I mentioned that his staff had informed us three times that the rooms would be ready The following day we returned to the hotel to find that our belongings had not been moved and yet again we had to unpack   pack etc  before finally being moved to connecting rooms on a smoking floor  we did not want smoking rooms     The buffet food was mediocre  not half as good as we have had at other similar graded hotels     When using the hotel safe  at reception  the staff didn t seem to have a clue what they were doing  even asking to see what I wanted to deposit in the safety box  The staff member later admitted it was her first time dealing with the safety deposit boxes Good Points   The hotel is spotlessly clean and the numerous Filipino staff are magnificent    Despite there being construction work very close to the hotel  it can hardly be heard and was not a nuisance In future we ll pay the extra and stay at the Jumeirah Beach Resort  
N =>  Very poor food We decided for this hotel after reading reviews at this website but now we know it was not the best choice   Stayed    nights at this hotel in the second half of        Arriving at the hotel early in the morning    a m    when checking in  we were asked to pay a     EUR guarantee  never had to pay money before when checking in  at any of previous    hotels     We were given to a room on the second floor with side sea view but our  quot main view quot  was at a tin roof  though we paid an extra fee at our touroperator for a front sea view and a higher floor Trying to change the room at reception  the staff told me that there was no other free room available  this was   a m   We were successful the same day in the afternoon  They finally gave us a room on  th floor  a little bit better than the previous one  but still no front sea view   only at construction work   The construction work  we were aware of it when planning our holiday  was not so much bothering  The Oceana restaurant staff was more bothering than the construction  They always standing in   metres distance from your table  like a policemen  we had feeling like they covet  quot we should quickly eat up and go quot   If you started to eat your  quot meal quot  hardly to speak about meal   very narrow and out of taste choice and everyday the same things situated on same places  starting with beans in tomato  thru scrambled eggs  tasting like mixed with flour   some pork and ending with grounds  and were in a half of eating  leaving your table to add for example some more vegetables  you could be quite certain of your plate was taken by  quot the excellent staff quot   no matter your knife and fork crossing  i e  I wish to go on eating   please do not take it    The eating room was also always very cold  We cancelled   of    dinners  as same experience like at breakfast   untasty meals  amp  unprofessional staff   our touroperator promised to refund it  The only one light point of our holiday was the sea   very warm and clear as well as the beach   Resume  This hotel does not match to a    hotel  maximum     Our previous experience with    hotels  Cyprus  Turkey    they all were higher standard than Hilton Jumeirah Beach Especially Turkey   Excellent meals   Due to poor meals and bothering restaurant staff   our holiday was poor  The staff   who opens car   taxi   door is unnecessary if the food is poor    I apologize for my poor English and wish all people enjoy their holidays   
N =>  Over booked Looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading the reviews BUT on arrival Executive suites overbooked   so had to stay in a holding room for two nights   VIRGIN rep no help at all  We eventually did get sorted out but as we had only booked for   nights we feel we had two days wasted  Hotel very good and service excellant  cannot say the same about VIRGIN holidays support though  Lots of building works but we expected that so no problem  Would visit again but NOT through Virgin holidays  
N =>  Fantastic for Chiildren We have stayed in Dubai many times but had not stayed here before  we could not have wished for a better stay  We were made to feel very welcome and from the minute we arrived the reception staff did everything they could to ensure we got into our room as early possible  The rooms were very modern and very large comfortable beds  The kids play room was fantastic as our daugther was under three we had to supervise her  but had a babysitter one afternoon which was very reasonable and my daughter was very happy with her  The outdoor play equipment was excellent and was cleaned down every day and was always very tidy We ate in Bice  which was very nice and also Pachanga all of which the service was impeccable and the food was great The building work did not affect us  yes there is a element of noise but the waves lapping up against the white sand soon drown this out  It is actually fascinating watching the work going on I think that the staff make this hotel what it is  All the staff knew our children s names before we left  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel expecially if you have small children  
N =>  A Very Happy Xmas We stayed over Xmas Boxing Day on our way to Australia and the hotel was fab  We were upgraded to an executive suite for no extra cost and the place was superb  We could have our breakfast in the  th floor lounge or in the main ground floor place  We did one of each and I d say the general place was better that the executive place  More choice of everything and more turnover of dishes We got access to the lounge from    pm for  quot Happy Hour quot   I thought this would be the usual   for   stuff but as it turned out  all the wines  beer  spirits etc were free of charge and there was a good selection of finger food to satisfy anyone  cheeses  smoked salmon  mini kebabs etc all free  Staff were very friendly and helpful  They were all obviously trained to make westerners happy by wearing Santa hats and saying  quot Merry Christmas quot  every time you made eye contact  Minor quibbles are the usual ones  The city is one huge building site  Not very noisy but not great to look at  Also  the hotel is about       minutes from downtown so not much to see in surrounding area  
N =>  Hilton Overshadowed by construction of much taller buildings I have just come back after a   day stay at the Hilton  This is not my first visit to Dubai so my opinion may point out some disappointments based on previous experiences  I had booked a Deluxe Plus room  i e  sea view  non  smoking  however upon arrival  a non smoking room wasn t ready  and we had to wait in the lobby  This was rather unfortunate as we were very tired after a   week stay in India and really wanted to sleep  After an hour a room was ready  however it was not a total sea view  it was half construction  and half pool and a bit of sea view  see photo attached   As I had stayed at the adjacent hotel Oasis Beach with a total sea view room   years ago I was disappointed with the view as in Oasis Beach Hotel sea view means a direct sea view  When I mentioned the partial sea view to reception staff  they informed me that only the suites have a total direct sea view  This is not clearly mentioned on the Hilton website  As seaview rooms  Deluxe Plus  cost more than standard  Deluxe  I think Hilton need to make this point clear  The balcony too is small  and shaded due to construction of much taller buildings behind Ok  good points  staff were friendly and greeted us and gave our child some crayons and colouring book upon arrival  The room was comfortable and once inside you cannot hear any construction sounds  Free water and fruit was available in the room  All the staff were courteous and always said hello  Breakfast buffet         am  was good  but a bit crowded especially at later breakfast times  There is a Kids Club  ages      I think   which is free of charge to use  However  if you wish to leave your child there s he must be   years old  Health club has a gym and spa area with sauna  steam room  these were very clean and not crowded and open till   p m The outdoor Pool I found the temperature of the water quite cold so we didn t use it  The pool area was also in the shade this again is due to the construction of much taller building behind the Hilton  In fact  during my entire stay  I only saw one person using the pool  The beach area and chill out areas are good place to chill or relax with prompt food service So  would I recommend Hilton  Yes  if you ve never been to Dubai you will love it  But personally  I feel there are definitely better   star and   star hotels available in Dubai so I personally would not stay there again Overall opinion of Dubai  I think the bubble is going to burst soon as the airlines and services don t seem to be able to cope with the large number of visitors drawn to the sunshine haven of clear blue skies and luxury accommodation      years ago the older Dubai Hotels were good and the flights not full  today all flights are flying      capacity  Sure  Dubai will make a lot of money out of this  It could be the next Menorca      CH  
N => absolutely fabulous A party of thirteen of us just returned from staying at the Hilton for   nights on ust   th  Well what more can we say I think all the previous reviewers have mentioned every little detail Before we went out to Dubai we were very apprehensive as to whether we had made the right choice of hotels admist all the construction work  We must admit this web page was an enormous help  Anyway we booked it and thought we won t know the real truth until we get outhere  We were unsure after seeing the holiday programme which I now think was very biased When we were approaching near our hotel we all did think  quot Oh my god we are right in the middle of a huge building site quot   but that was all immediately forgotten as soon as were welcomed by the staff and  when we saw this huge but absolutley amazing lobby  We were given juice whilst we were checking in and the children received colouring pencils and books  When we were allocated to our rooms we were not happy as the room had only one huge bed  As we were sharing with children we wanted rooms with   double beds  We were given folding beds for the night and the manager promised us to move us to different rooms the next day  which they did not hesitate to do with even better sea views Everything about the hotel was      perfect  The kids loved it and did not want to leave  The food was brilliant and we can t praise the staff enough  As for the noise you could not hear one thing  The only noise you could hear throught the night was the air conditioning  Our stay was absolutely fabulous and would love to go back next year and see the building work completed  
N =>  Nice Hotel I recently went to Dubai for a   day business trip  Had stayed in this hotel a few years before and the hotel still looks good  Might seem dated when compared to the more luxurious hotels but at these prices it is still worth it  Wanted to stay in a Laguna Suite and was  quot disappointed quot  to be given an Executive Suite instead  Was explained that due to the construction work  they had closed off the Laguna Suite Anyway  this was still excellent  Nice living room  spacious bedroom  really comfortable bed    balconies and daily complimentary fruit  Staff were really helpful  pool  amp  beach was pleasant and not too overcrowded  maybe because y is way too hot   over    degrees  Even with the construction work going on all night  once you shut the balcony doors you could not hear a single thing so i was still able to sleep peacefully Would definitely stay here again if on business  for holidays with the family nothing beats Jumeirah Beach Hotel   
N => Absolutely fabulous We have just returned from a fabulous week in Dubai  U A E  We stayed at the Hilton hotel on Jumeirah Beach and it was   star all the way Okay  so there was a wee bit of construction going on across the road  but this did not retract from our holiday  If anything it added to it  You will never see anything like this again in your lifetime The hotel was fantastic as were all the people working there  From the guy that looked after our room to the staff on the beach  Friendly and helpful with beautiful manners  We cannot speak highly enough of them all The beach was absolutely magnificent with the whitest sand and warmest water we have ever experienced  The ice cold towels and cold face spray were a little extra which were really appreciated As for Dubai itself  what can we say but WOW  Had lunch at Burj Al Arab and it was fantastic  What a place  it has to be seen to be believed Fabulous shopping malls  all in all a great holiday which we would recommend to anyone  
N => excellent   return trip amust Just returned from   day stay at this hotel was aware of building work but it did take me by suprise hoever had no impact on my enjoyment at all service at hotel is first class brilliant customer care given by all staff stayed in exec lagoon room but due to building work couldn t see lake at all changed to another room without any problems at all we were on holiday with our   yr old son and he said it was the best holiday he d been on he has also been to orlando disney part of our package included breakfast in the lounge on the  th fllor with afternoon cakes snacks tea coffee juice between  pm  pm then nibbles with cocktails between  pm  pm WE HAD PLANNED OUR ITINERARY BEFORE WE SET OFF  MUST DO TRIPS SIGHTS ETC BUT NEVER ACHIEVED HALF OF THIS SO CALLED LIST DOWN TO SERVICE WE RECEIVED AT HOTEL STAFF LOOK AFTER YOU SO WELL LITTLE THINGS FROM COOL DRINK AT CHECKING IN TO ICE COLD SCENTED FLANNELS HANDED OUT BY STAFF WHEN SUN BATHING THEY ARE THERE TO LOOK AFTER YOU WITHOUT BEING INTRUSIVE  
N =>  Continues to be a great hotel  
N => Sch nes Hotel in sehr guter Lage  
N =>  Good Location service hit and miss Stayed at Holiday inn for   Nights  location was great  room was upto the usual Holiday inn standards  however service was hit and miss  I had to call front deskk   times before Hot water was made available to my room  getting Iron and ironing board was a challenge  had to call over   times before it was made available The put off was paying      per night  I had to pay to internet connection    Swimming pool on the roof top is very basicApart from this  I think its a good hotel  just   minnute walk front he train station which was handy  
N =>  DUBAI   beautiful city  HOLIDAY INN DOWNTOWN  extrodinary service  I don t normally take the time to write reviews  but after my recent stay at the Holiday Inn Downtown in Dubai  I somehow feel the need to tell everybody how exceptional this hotel was and a recommendation is a must  My mother and I booked a holiday to Dubai  Greece  Croatia  Serbia  Austria and London  We went to our travel agent who organised all accommodation and flights  We settled on holiday inn downtown as being new to Dubai we didn t know what to expect and we knew that Holiday Inn was well known  We were a bit hesitant when we arrived at Dubai airport  Travelling    hours from Australia that is expected  We had our transfer pick us up from the airport and within    minutes we were at our hotel  The moment we stepped into the hotel we automatically felt relaxed and at ease  Our check in experience was fantastic and the staff greeted us graciously  The amount of respect and kindness the staff have for you is unbelievable  We felt as if we were special guests and not just a number like we usually are treated in most hotels  Joy  the gentleman that worked in the lobby was fantastic  He told us everything we needed to know about Dubai  the key places to visit  the key things to try and the key shopping areas to make the most of our stay  He was always so cheerful and helpful  He is really one of a kind  Breakfast at the hotel was exceptional  We met a lady by the name of Nilan who always made sure we had everything we needed without having to ask  She was also a very friendly woman  always happy  With an attitude like that it made us really look forward to breakfast and the day ahead  The cleanliness of the rooms were excellent and the temperature was excellent  The cleaners always asked us when we would like our room cleaned and catered to it as apposed to most hotels where they do it when its convenient for them  Mohammed the hotel security guard always made us feel safe and secure  we felt as if we could knowingly leave the hotel for hours and not have to worry about our things or anybody trespassing through the building  There was also another lady who books tours  I cant remember her name  however she was very friendly and informative and catered to our needs  The facilities were fantastic  There is a gym  a pool  bistro  bar and room service  And the view from the top of the hotel is lovely  I recommend the desert safari tour  the city sights tour and the dinner cruise tour if you get the chance to ever visit Dubai which can be booked at the hotel  Dubai is such a beautiful city my mum and I are absolutely in love with it and I would go again in a heart beat  But I know that if it wasn t for the staff at the Holiday Inn Downtown  we probably wouldn t have been as open to all the experiences nor would we have appreciated the place as much as we do  We feel forever loyal to Holiday Inn Downtown and whenever I get the chance to go back to Dubai again I know that I don t need to worry about accommodation as that is where I definitely will be staying  We are now halfway through our trip and to be honest with you we are pretty disappointed with the accommodation so far  Holiday Inn Downtown really set the bench mark which I believe will be nearly impossible to beat  Thank you to all the staff at the Holiday Inn Downtown for your exceptional service and we will definitely see you again soon  Vesna  
N =>   My Experince with Holiday inn Dubai down town  This is not only a word of just  thank you  but also to express my sincere thanks to the entire team of HI Down town colleagues  Hotel service standards have tremendously improved from my last visit  This is a really remarkable achievement My self and my wife were in room     from   st  to   th        During my stay your HK colleagues were extremely helpful and were taken care of us very well  The room was supplied with adequate amenities always and well maintained the IHC standards  Overall the Room Attendants Sankar  amp  Iqbal were very kind and generous to meet our requirements  The front office concierge Shakeel too very helpful and even the driver  sorry I forgot his name  assist me to send  Hotel show brochures  to Saudi Arabia through post office  So many other colleagues  again sorry I can t remember everybody s names  were also very attentive to our request and helpful during our stay in your hotel Service from Reservation  Reception  and Room service to Lobby tea lounge was extremely out standing and remarkable  Keep up the good spirit Kindly covey my best regards to all your colleagues and I wish them all the success with HI in down town and their future career Wish you a pleasant summer  Thank you 
N =>  Dubai here we come I took my family to holiday in Dubai  I booked two rooms in this hotel thru Priority Club  The hotel room charges were way too much  Dhs          compared to other   Star hotel in the vacinity  The Only reason I booked this hotel is because of the name  Holiday Inn   The area close to the hotel is filthy and dirty and full of oil stains  Lots of papers lying around The swimming pool was not up to the standard of a   star hotel  The pool was filthy and there was no attendants to look after you  The sun bathe chairs were filthy and dirty The food is average  The worst part there is an Indian Disco club on the Ist Floor which is not owned by Holiday Inn Group who plays very loud music until     a m  I think looking back  I made a terrible mistake in staying in Holiday Inn  Down Town Dubai  I certainly would not recommend this hotel to anyone else  
N =>   not as bad as the other review said I had read quite a few reviews about the holiday inn and I must admit it worried me  I can honestly say we were pleasently surprised  it did not smell of old smoke  The bedroom was clean and large and quite well equipped  The hotel is not posh like you would expect in dubai but the location was really good we could walk to most places from the hotel  The creek was well within walking distance  would recomend this hotel as fairly cheap and convenient  The travel  concierge girl was really good really helpfull  she gave us lots of ideas and nothing was too much trouble  
N =>  Not Bad Not a bad hotel Front desk was very helpfull and concierge knowledgable of the area and within in   min organised a chauffer on short notice During our stay we were not disturbed by any noise  maybe because we were on the business floor  however the our room lighting was poor  I had to open the drapes for more lighting  The room was very spacious and basic  nothing fancy  a bit dated maybe  but good enough for a short stay  Even though they had designated smoking areas  the stale odour of cigarettes and cigars cannot be disguised     
N =>  YIKES well      i was excited about my   nights in dubai  but i must say i m not very impressed  On arrival  the porter was nice  couldnt help us enough  Reception staff was a bit off  not very smiley or happy to see a guest  i felt as though we d put him out  Room was clean but basic and very dark  Bar staff were ok  again  not very enthusiatic or friendly  what i was shocked at  was that the  quot night club quot  is actually a brothel type affair  the poor women dance on stage until a horrid leary old man puts a necklace one her which means she is  sold  to him for an hour  YUK  i didnt think this sort of thing went on in dubai The bistro restaurant food is vile  cold and greasy and over priced  dont eat there  and the billabong bar was closed  all in all a very disappointing trip  
N => 	Avoid it if you Can    I have recently been staying at the Downtown Holiday Inn It has been during the time of Arab Health Conference so Dubai all the hotels are full  so this was not our choice to stay here I have stayed in many Holiday Inns worldwide and in no way does this compare with any I have stayed in The hotel is in Deira in not the nicest of areas  frequented by some dubious people going to the nightclub situated in the hotel My room was on the third floor it was very noisey from the club  the bathroom had mould growing in the bath Going in and out of the hotel you do not particulary feel safe and need to be aware of what is going on around you  Dubai is pretty crime free but singe females need to be aware There are lots of choices nearby  Traders and Reinassance  if they are full avoid this if you can We did not eat in the hotel but others have said that the food was not particulary good  
N =>   Not bad The Holiday Inn located in Deira Dubai is fairly good value  The rooms have good king sized beds and are clean  The location is not bad but you can get better value in the same area in my opinion  The front desk staff are effecient but not especially friendly but the bell staff are helpful  The very large bar on the first floor is rather empty in the early evening  It seems to get going later at night  If you like pool they have good tables  If you can get a room at under      then it is not a bad place to stay  
N =>  Please DON T go this hotel unless you want to be get ripped off    I had no choice but to use Holiday Inn DT Dubai this week because it was the only hotel I can get during he exhibition period  They cheated me sly with the room rates  using this busy exhibition season  I respect the founder of Holiday Inn  but this time I m very disappointed at the Holiday Inn Downtown Dubai  
N =>  Pleasant but      I alongwith my family stayed in Holiday Inn Downtown Dubai from   nd OCT      TO    OCT      We occupied two adjoining rooms I was really worried once i read various comments about staff and hotel as i had already made a booking before seeing any review Contrary to negative comments we found staff very friendly and cooperative roome were clean and spacious and room services were uptodate We had a comfortable stay and we never experienced any noise I was really pleased with the overall friendly and homely atmosphere as we found it much better than various hotels even in UK FRANCE AND USA where we stayed previously But last day of our stay was made bitter by the lady receiptionist on duty who told us very rudely around    noon to vacate the rooms or agree to pay extra We told her that our flight is around      PM and we shall leave the hotel around      PM but she insisted for extra charge We agreed as there was no option and vacated one room and shifted our luggage in other which caused us lot of inconvenience Later while checking out  i mentioned to gentleman on duty who was very nice and cooperative fellow about this unpleasant experience who after consulting duty manager agreed not to charge extra for   hours It was pleasant experience where every body cooperated except one DR SAFDAR HUSSAIN BRUNEI DARUSSALAM 
N =>  I was satisfied with the Hotel and enjoyed my stay Having read the reviews before going I was apprehensive to say the least The staff proved helpful and polite  The rooms although not large  were adequate to use as a base for sightseeing etc  They were clean and were cleaned daily The swimming pool although small was clean and the area well presented The only meals we had were Breakfast  The buffet was checked regularly and the standard of food was good I understand the problem of the noise from the Nightclub  we were on the other side of the Hotel so were not bothered but the noise level was high in the vincinity  We kheard no noise from corridors or other guests  
N =>  Great time at the Holiday Inn After reading all of the earlier reviews I was more than a little worried  I can t believe that the earlier reviews are genuine except there is a small truth in some of them  I did not find one staff member who did not try to be as helpfull as possible  I was on the  rd floor which is   above the music bar and I heard music up until      pm on   occasions  but it wasn t that loud  The swimming pool on the roof was fine  The hotel had a courtesy bus to the beach every day bar Wednesday  we weren t told that it didn t go on Wednesday  The Australian bar was fine but the locals use it  I didn t find it seedy although one night there was an elderly guy with   younger girls  The rooms are large and possibly a little dark but it was     outside and the Air conditioning worked fine  The food at breakfast was very good with good service  All in all we found it to be a very good hotel and we were there for   weeks  There was one thing though  on mondays they seem to reset your door card which means you can t get in and have to go to reception to have it reset  which they did immediately  
N =>  never again stayed   nights during the shopping festival and wil never go back  Room not serviced without having to ask  No fresh water  awful outlook of private balconies  Reception staff rude and unhelpful  We reserved   nights in advance but after   nights were asked by a note under the door to settle for the   we had had already  On calling reception we said we would settle it altogether on check out  They agreed but on returning to the hotel found we had been locked out of our room             Neither of our cards worked  They again asked for settlement for the   nights we had spent so we payed for the   altogether and they re set our key cards  parking is very limited and hotel not in a good area  Windows in room do not open at all  The bar had no draught beer and when we ordered a draught cider they brought an opened bottle of very strong cider to the table  We did not eat there at all so can t comment on the food  Stayed at hotels all over the world and this is the worst we have ever come across   
N =>  Disgusting place My husdand and I stayed in the Holiday Inn Downtown from   th ember     st ember      When we arrived our room was on the  th floor but on the second night we asked to be moved to another floor due to the noise from the nightclub on the first floor Bar and nightclub were filthy and a lot of undesirables on the dance floor We found the staff down right rude  especially the staff on the reception area Swimming pool on the roof top was disgusting  looked as if it had not be cleaned in months Would I go back   never  Would not recommend this hotel to a dog  
N =>  Do Not Stay At This Place This Holiday Inn in Downtown Dubai was very disappointing  The dance club music was very loud  the majority of personnel at reception desk were clueless about anything we d ask  The beds were horrible  Enough said  
N => Wouldn t have paid for it  Let me start by saying that I didn t have to pay for this hotel as I won a competition for a holiday to Dubai  but       well  the rooms were big but very dark and seedy  our room was   floors above the hotel nightclub but could hear the music coming from the club as if it was in the room next to us  luckily we were so tired most nights so we didn t care bar was full of dodgy  ladies of the night  and the hotel was generally in a dodgy area hotel nowhere near a beach and the pool was out of use so we went and spent    quid each going to the jumeirah beach hotel every day   well worth it  by the way  
N =>   Un h tel correct ni plus ni moins  
N =>   very very basic Stayed here for   days in november       We booked directly from the hotel website for a reasonable price including breakfast  I had stayed at the holiday inn chain before at Singapore and somehow expected a similar experience here  Check in was smooth  Our room was on the  th floor  I had booked the most basic room   my mistake    The room was extremely small  with almost no space to move around  So small that it was hard for me to take a photograph of the entire room  The window faced Sheik Zayed Road and we had a nice view of the Burj Al Arab Hotel The bathroom was clean and the shower was good  There was no iron ironing board by default in this category of rooms and we had to request housekeeping to supply us with one  I would think that an iron would be one of the basic amenities available in any hotel of this class The breakfast menu was similar on all   days that we ate there  barring changes in   or   dishes We did not use the pool  but I peeped in to see how it was  The pool is situated on the terrace of the building and was really really small  That was the smallest pool I have ever seen and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who would want to use a pool during their vacations The staff were friendly throughout the stay  I was given the wrong bill during checkout and had to point that out before the correct bill was given In the end I believe I got what I paid for in Dubai  I suspect a slightly higher budget than normal would be required to get a better room  This Holiday Inn experience was nothing like that I had in Holiday Inn Singapore  I would expect some consistency from such a brand  
N =>   give   stars but      We stayed at H I  Al Barsha int     As with lots of reviews hotel excellent in every way     but NOT   REVIEW mentions the problem of prostitutes in the bar  be its only a recent problem   but the management told me there was not a lot they can do about it   We stayed using priority points and were delighted in having to use so little points  We checked out after our third night because of what i would consider an uncomfortable feeling in the bar area   drinks were not allowed in the lobby area     I m not a prude   but it was too blatant We were in several other bars and did not find this problem  This is a really nice hotel   but i would have to give it a miss on my next visit   and pay the extra for the Jumeirah Hilton If you are staying at the Holiday Inn Al Barsha soon     DO NOT MISS THE THAI RESTAURANT     FABULOUS   
N =>   Good hotel We stayed for  day in this hotel  not bad a place  It has a rooftop swimming pool of a decent size with gr  view of burj al arab  atlantis burj dubai  The room was nice not very spacious though  The buffet breakfast menu had a good selection  The walls are maybe a bit thin as i was able to hear some noises  The night shift check in staff were very lousy   A good place over all for all  
N =>  Good hotel next to mall next to motorway noisy when using pool Good hotel  big yellow crane and motorway near by  but excellent value Dubai is still a building site remember Next to ski Dubai get taxi from the street  they run every    seconds  hotel charges you more  
N =>   Good hotel  Good brand new hotel next to the Mall of the Emirates    minutes walk  I arrived to the hotel at  am and I was given a room straight away  no need to wait until check in time Room was big  clean  and quiet It has a medium sized gym and a small pool on the roof top but it was never crowded  
N =>   Great Hotel watch out for the extras on your bill though  The hotel is new  we stayed in uary       and is in a decent location  although if your driving  it s a nightmare to reach due to the road layout  It is next to the Emirates Mall  walking distance  so has plenty of facilities on its doorstep  The hotel itself is medium sized with plenty of facilties  great Gym and rooftop pool  excellent bar and restaurants  Checking in and out took far to long  especially checking out  when we had to make it to the airport  When we arrived at the hotel it took aproximately    minutes to chek in  which is too long with   fidgety kids in tow  however we were upgraded to a   bed apartment style room  which were very spacious and beautifully appointed  However this where our problem began   when checking out we were charged for the upgrade  I had to get my laptop out to show the unhepful woman behind the desk how much I d paid for the room online  To my dismay  they agreed to reduce the rate but not to the rate agreed  I had no choice but to pay for the increase otherwise I would miss my flight  When I threatened to wak out  I was told that I would not be able to board my plane as I would be arrested for non payment of a debt    I asked to speak to a manager  non was available  It was a real shame because up until departure I would have recomended this hotel  but now I simply cant as I feel that I have been scammed  
N => Nice Hotel Terrible After Service I stayed in this hotel for a weekend visit with my husband  We found it comfortable and in a decent location for our visit as we wanted to go to Ski Dubai  The hotel was much nicer than I expected  however for the price you pay it wasn t exactly value for money   but I haven t been able to find a reasonably priced hotel in Dubai as yet  Breakfast was great   lovely fresh juices and they had a sort of  egg bar  where you could have your eggs cooked however you liked I didn t have any problems with the hotel really during our stay  however housekeeping woke us up one morning about  am   so I wouldn t recommend the hotel if you were planning on any sleeping in   The problems that I did have were afterward when I called to ask if anything had been found in our hotel room  as I wasn t sure if we left my husband s cufflinks there For starters  if reception transfers your call to another department  they cannot transfer you back to reception   which seems like a bit of a ridiculous phone system to have in what is meant to be a    hotel  When I called  reception could not tell me what room number I stayed in and then proceeded to transfer my call to housekeeping without explaining to them what I was looking for or even what my room number was  I had to call them back more than   times to get a straight answer  and finally I was told that I would receive a call back  All I can say for now  is that please make sure you triple and quadruple check everything in your room before leaving  because if you even think you may have forgotten something  the telephone service is beyond ridiculous  
N =>   Quite Suprised We were plesently suprised by the Holiday Inn Al Barsha  This hotel has only been open for approx     months  Only floors     where opened when we stayed The rooms were of good size and tastefully decorated  We usually find holiday inn rooms small  but this time they exceeded our expectations We were upgraded from a Standard Room to Deluxe FOC  only down point was it was a smoking floor  however  our room was just opened so there was no smoke smell   only a little through the aircon in the bathroom The aircon drove us crazy   we couldn t get it just right  we were always freezing Hotel very close to the mall of the Emirates   mins walk  To Jumeriah  approx    mins drive  The hotel wasn t in full swing but will be in   months approx  Concierge very helpfull and friendly  Hotel has just received their liquour licence and they are still working on their basement nightclub pool bar  Heaps of construction work going on around   as is everywhere else  but it doesn t effect your stay Overall very nice  very clean and the pool view is pretty good too  
N =>   wouldnt rate highly ok  stay  should rename to budget rather than express  Room ok  breakfast limited  reasonable expensive but hey its the middle east  
N =>   the worst hotel in the world  I ve stayed in luxurious five star hotels and I ve stayed in    a night budget hotels with more soul than a five star  but this      a night hotel tops my list as the worst hotel in the world I will spare you the minute details of the hairs in the shower cubicle from a previous customer or the fact that there was no soap in the bathroom  I won t mention that the snack bar was empty and yet the fridge was switched on running on wasted energy But what I will tell you is they don t give a damn  They simply do not care  I stayed in room      I was in Dubai for business  The first night I developed a really bad headache verging on a migraine  And when I asked reception if they could provide me with some aspirin they said they did not stock aspirin  They said I would need to go out and get it myself  Fine I thought to myself I ll go up to my room and hopefully after a nap I ll be fine to go and get some aspirin myself  But then as the night continued  the headache developed into a full blown migraine  I called room service and again asked if they could provide me with some aspirin  The woman on the other end of the phone said she would see what she could do  but I never heard back So a little later as I was verging on delirium and half thinking my brains were going to blow out  I called them again and pleaded if they could at least drop off a bottle of water  That after I d again heard the robotic reply that they do not have room service  Now please can someone tell me which hotel does not have room service in this day and age  Yes I buy the fact it s at the lower end of the market  but it is still a fully fledged hotel and the rates they charge are not exactly humble  Around      a night is still a reasonable price and you can expect a minimum level of service for that amount  It wasn t a request for a club sandwich with fries exactly  All I wanted was some consideration for my situation Finally a security man arrived with a small bottle of water  Obviously they never bothered to check how I was doing and I never got the requested aspirin either  So I just lay there in the dark and I took the empty ice bucket out of the fridge and put it on my forehead so that I could cool it off in desperation  Necessity is the mother of invention after all  As I lay there in the dark trying to survive the night  I finally fell asleep  But I awoke several times in the night in agony thinking the darkest thoughts  And you won t believe it  they also wanted to charge me for that bottle of water To cut a long story short after checking out I also discovered my spectacles were missing  So I called their lost and found department the next day and it took several phone calls from my UK mobile phone to realise I was getting nowhere  A promise of an email reply with the whereabouts of my lost glasses was also just a meaningless empty promise  I say it again they just don t care Finally I resorted to old fashioned tactics  A friend kindly drove me all the way back o the hotel where I thought my personal presence might make a difference  After several conversations and waiting around in the lobby and me explaining I was in a hurry  I certainly didn t want to spend my last few hours in Dubai at the Holiday Inn Express  I finally spoke to the lost and found supervisor  but unsurprisingly he could not locate my glasses  He said they were never found  He said they had checked with the person who had made up my room after my departure and they were not there even though I d specified that I d left them on the pillow  So they had either been stolen or just disposed of  I admit the glasses were quite old and not exactly attractive people likened them to the Ugly Betty glasses  but they were of value to me and they were mine  So where did they end up  I ask the Holiday Inn Express why would they have just disappeared  Obviously they were not a tip  So exuse my repetition  They simply do not care  
N =>  Good hotel for business in Internet City or Jebel Ali Holyday Inn Internet City is ideal hotel for short business stay  if you have to work in Internet City of Jebel Ali  Far from City center  it is surely not good location to discover Dubai  There should be no good nor bad surprise  but service as often in Dubai can be erratic  rate is average and transfer from airport can take time and will increase the bill  As limousines are late  taxi will be best solution from DXB  Rooms are too dark for my taste  not that large but ok to sleep     days  restaurant not cheap  but you have no real choice  
N =>   Good Business Hotel I caused complete confusion at the front desk by booking by phone so I arrived one day earlier than my on line booking  Hotel itself was fine   clean and quiet  Staff were mostly helpful  I liked the rooftop bar restaurant  accessible by separate elevator  more than the hotel restaurant  which was not well suited to a diabetic vegetarian    
N =>  Not luxury but clean new and modern This hotel was built a year ago and looks just like the ones we find in North America  It has an excellent restaurant  a decent cafe and bar The rooms are large  spotless  nicely furnished It s not luxurious like some other Dubai hotels  seems to target the business traveler on a budget  Not cheap  but nothing is in Dubai  It s a ten minute taxi ride to the Souk Madinat  very interesting   the incredible Burj al Arab hotel  the marina  a water park  Wadi   the Emirates Mall  with indoor skiing  etc  About a half hour from the airport and from the old part of the city like the Creek and the Souks  less if traffic is light  I stayed for a week  while teaching photography at Knowledge Village next door  as did    others in our group  We agreed it was preferable to the Tulip Inn  nearby     where the group stayed in       The staff were helpful  although service in the bar was a bit slow during busy periods  understaffed  Overall  I would recommend this hotel to anyone not seeking a fabulous Arabian experience or luxury   If you ARE  check out the Bab al Shams resort in the desert  we did not stay there but did visit friends who were   Peter www peterkburian com 
N =>   Ok Hotel clean but watch out when paying during checkout  Our stay was just ok at best  we didn t stay at the hotel very much except to sleep and  quot eat quot  in the morning  the  quot continental quot  breakfast was ok at best  they didn t have much variety at all  some bread  cereal  milk and juice is all you ll get  I liked the clean lobby and entrance areas  The front desk people weren t that friendly  except for a nice Vietnamese girl  unfortunately we saw her only once upon our initial arrival  the others we re not rude per say  but acted clever and tried to rip you off in a sly sort of way  There was also so much noise in the hallways upstairs we even had to call security  We had clearly payed for our room thru Orbitz before leaving for Dubai and even had a print out of our receipt with us  Upon checking out    days later  they said the receipt was invalid and told us it was only a reservation  not an actual receipt  After some arguments we ended up paying for the room  again   just so we could shut those guys up because we weren t going to win our argument  After coming back from our trip we checked our credit card statement and guess what we saw  Obviously  the double charge for our room  After some appealing and disputing several times with our credit card company investigated the matter and kindly refunded our money back  WHAT A HEADACHE   
N =>   As usual Holiday Inn Express does not disappoint We stayed at this hotel for   days and we were very impressed  The staff was friendly  facilities were immaculate and there was free parking which was a bonus for us  Hotels in Dubai are expensive so this would be perfect for persons like us who want to explore  ie not laze around in a hotel all day   The meals in the restaurant were actually quite good too  They had a free shuttle to Dubai Mall and the beach  
N =>  Better than a   Star Hotel    I went for value and for a location near the highway for our trip to the Seven s Rugby World Cup  I didnt expect much as the price was very affordable and was unsure how bare bones a Holiday Inn Express would be  never having been to one  Upon arrival though  we were greeted by a great staff and they were very helpful in giving my friends and I adjoining rooms  We saw other rugby fans staying there as well  which was a good sign  Our rooms were awesome  Very spacious and quiet  even though we were near the freeway  From our hotel  it was a piece of cake to catch the roads we needed to get to the Rugby Sevens stadium  After returning from the  st day  we found out that the cheerleaders for the event were also staying there as well  This hotel could do no wrong  We went to the buffet they offered and the food was excellent  The chefs there deserve kudos upon kudos  We went there   out of the   nights because the food was so good  their continental breakfasts in the morning  which were included in our room rate  were very good and just enough to tide you over in the morning  I can t say enough what a great experience it was to stay here  I m very budget concious and this place is worth every penny I spent  If you expect to be pampered and catered upon  go to a resort  If you want to be greeted warmly by all the staff no matter the time of day or night  want a great place to eat and get your monies worth for your stay  go to this Holiday Inn Express  
N =>  A Holiday in the Express  I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express from y to tember whilst I was trying to find accommdation as I have just started working in Dubai I found the hotel to be excellent value for money with all services on offer with the exception of a pool but you have to remember the nature of the hotel The staff and management were very courteous in every way and nothing was too much trouble I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone  It s centrally located with easy access to and from the Sheik Zayed Road I found that the best radio station to listen to whilst staying in Dubai was Classic Hits Radio   on      FM or     FM if you travel to Abu Dhabi Radio   was also a great listen on      FM  amp        FM in Abu Dhabi  
N =>   Eureka hotel   absolutely loved this gem  I arrived in Dubai having no clue where anything was but taxi s were pretty cheap  I went to Dubai purely because my boyfriend was in the navy and he had a week off  so i stayed for   nights i think it was  I flew out there not knowing what to expect  It was incredible flying in from London  Dubai looks absolutely beautiful from the sky  the lights are incredible  I ve never been more in awe of anything  It was a manic  hot taxi drive into Dubai from the airport but it wasnt far  when we got outside the hotel it looked pretty nice  it had beautiful steps and a beautiful entrance hall  The rooms were nice  had a beautiful bathroom and bedroom  the view from the window was fine  it was of the city  the rooms got very hot so you would put the air con on but then it got too cold so you d have to adjust the heat during the night  My favourite part of the hotel was something we found two days into the stay and i wish we found it sooner  On the roof was a beautiful swimming pool  it was small but there was a lovely sunbathing area and the views were incredible  The swimming pool was often empty and my boyfriend and I often were the only ones in it  it wasnt open until very late  i think about   o clock  which was disappointing when we got back late from shopping or whatever  Apart from recommending the hotel i would      recommend Dubai it was the most incredible holiday i have ever been lucky to go on  For a low star hotel i was incredibly impressed  if you want a cheap trip with a hotel close to everything then go for Eureka  I would definetely go there again  
N =>   Pay a bit more and get a better Hotel Stayed there recently while conducting business in Dubai Lobby   probably     sq m   very basic and not impresiive at all and there is bell serviceOver the counter   not great service but not rude eitherNightclub   one  unable to comment as it was during the month of RamadanCafe   under renovationThere are however  some shops allocated nearby  a laundry  a local coffee shop  a convenient store  Other than that surrounding were serviced apartmens  suites  and other hotels Lift   one and only  basic and cleanCorridors   very small smell of smoke  with dark coloured carpetsRoom   small  but clean with an empty fridge  very basic not lavishly furnished  furniture still in acceptable qualityBathroom   clean  and very basicBasically did not expect too much at the price that we were paying  but we would want to pay slightly more for a better hotel next time  
N =>   Eureka deserves more than   Stars I booked this hotel in uary after reading reviews on the Internet  As it was only for   nights  it was not so important if it was not a fantastic hotel  but what appealed to me was that one guest said that they were able to check in early  and as we were planning on getting there at   a m   we opted for it It was only when we were about to land that we realised that I had made an error with the booking  and my booking was for   days from the date I planned to check out We explained to the front desk who told us the matter could be fixed easily if they received the confirmation from lastminute com  where we had booked  and that we should check in  In the evening when we got back to the hotel  we were told we would have to pay the rack rate  twice the price almost of the internet price  if they did not get the confirmation from lastminute com  I was very displeased about this  as I had told them in the morning that if there was a problem our taxi driver could easily find us an hotel if there was a problem  I had to go to a phone booth eventually and managed to contact lastminute com who sent a fax to them and sorted out the problem  I could then relax again  They could have tried to be a bit more helpful  even if the mistake was made by me Nevertheless  I must say that we were very pleased with the hotel  our room and its location  We stayed in a   star hotel in Rome last year and this was much better than that hotel  We had a refrigerator  but no coffee or tea making facilities  We asked for a room on the top floor to avoid the noise from the discotheques and thus had   good nights of sleep Breakfast was fine for the price As an additional service to its guests  the hotel arranges a complimentary shuttle to the airport  Let the reception know what time your flight is  and they will try to accommodate your requests Overall  I must say that it represents fair value for money and in a relatively good location for using public transport  
N =>  Good Value Stayed at the Eureka for a couple of nights after   nights in the   star JW riott  amp  found it to be good value for money  The rooms were small but clean  amp  the staff were extremely helpful  Passports were taken on arrival but returned willingly on request a few hours later  
N =>  Eureka Hotel Dubai   False Advertising as Luxury I looked at the websites carrying this hotel and each one used the same wording as a luxury hotel with exquisite setting  etc  I could never get a physical address to give to the taxi driver from the airport and the service I used to book the reservation was absolutely useless but that s another review in itself  It so happens the taxi driver I took from the airport was familiar with this hotel and did not need the barely readable map I printed from the website  I asked what this hotel was like with enthusiasm but his distant look in the rearview mirror at me in the backseat along with a pause and sigh said it all  He finally answered   quot it s clean  quot  Once arriving at the hotel it was nice on the outside but not nearly as large of a lobby as the online picture suggest and the room nearly made me cry  My first comment to the bellman was   quot it s really small  quot  When I thought about it even the elevator was exceptionally small carrying     average size adults comfortably  It had an old closed up and slightly moth like smell to it prompting me to open the window and burn a scented candle  It was the middle of the night and changing hotels was not an option after a    hour flight  The obvious renovations would better be described as redecorations  The handles in the bathtub were rusted on each side  the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor  There was just under   feet of space between the tub and sink  You do better to bring your own soap products though they did provide small bars  extremelly small   The food was okay to good  The staff was nice and I have to say the bed was comfortable as far as the mattress but the pillows were too soft offering no support and gave me neck problems  When the housekeeper arrived I had to leave the room  There was not enough space for both of us at the same time especially if you have large luggage pieces In all of my travels I have never seen a hotel room so small and I ve been all over the world but on top of everything else they want to hold your passport  This was by no means my first trip to the Middle East and in particular Dubai and the front desk staff always take a picture of the information page on my passport for their records but I immediately receive my passport back into my possession  The Eureka staff wants to hold onto the physical passport until they receive clearance from the police you have no criminal record  I assured them they had my money and I was no flight risk but I will NOT be in this country without my passport in my hand  Finally they gave it back to me  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely not if you are looking for luxury  I assummed it to be a boutique hotel by the advertising  it is not  M B P USA 
N =>  Not so Bad I just came back from a four day  three night stay in Dubai  I stayed at the Eureka Hotel  based on location and their internet site  not to mention price   I have to say  after reading the other reviews  I was feeling more than slightly nervous about my choice  Well let me tell you  the folk writing those prior reviews must have very high expectations of a two star hotel  There was not a thing wrong with the place  Yes  the towels were a bit shabby  but the place was clean  the people were more than pleasant  and the bed was comfortable  I can t comment on the breakfast  because I didn t partake  Noise from the street  I haven t stayed in too many hotels where you don t get some street noise  There was absolutely NO noise from adjoining rooms  however  The mini bar  When I checked in  I was informed that the mini bar was just an empty refrigerator  Hair dryer  I never travel without one anyhow  so it didn t matter that there wasn t one  Would I stay there again  Without a problem  
N =>  What a sad place Sadly  we had already booked the Eureka before reading the other reviews  The place seems to have deteriorated further  Thin frayed towels  slightly greasy sheets  aircon that stayed on freeze  double glazing that didn t keep out the noise of construction site nearby  Breakfast taken in the  Indian nightclub    red carpet on the walls  dim  food difficult to see   probably a good thing  Worst scrambled egg I have ever seen  Avoid this hotel at all costs  Two well seasoned travellers  
N => This is not a   star hotel I arrived in Dubai after a night flight from the UK  and I could not understand why the taxi driver seemed not to have heard of the hotel  Upon arrival at the hotel I understood  it is a small dingy hotel located in a back street  I went to check in and despite paying for a room from the night before  I had to wait half an hour until a room was ready for me  When I saw the room I could have cried  The room was miniscule  there was just enough room to walk round the double bed  that was until I put my suitcase and flight case on the floor as there was no where else to put them  The furniture was a total mish mash of what looked like second hand items and the wardrobe concealed just   old wire coat hangers  There was no mini bar  just an empty fridge and no hair dryer  There was just one electrical socket in the room and that was well away from the  dressing table  area  Happily there was an extension lead so I was able to add to the electrical over load and plug in my own hair dryer  One problem   I now couldn t see in the mirror  In order to see in the mirror and use my hairdryer I had to kneel on the bed  I decided to get some sleep and maybe once I was less tired things would look better  They didn t  Following a shower and a day at the expo I had to attend my mind was made up  I had to find a different hotel  I managed to get a room at another hotel and checked out of the Eureka  I travel extensively all over the world and have put up with many different short comings but there is no way that I can recommend this hotel  
N =>   Some bad experience Me and my friend have just returned a week back from our tour of Dubai and while booking the hotel we were made to understand that the hotel pickup service is free and that we shall be picked up from the airlines bus stop  but no one was there to pick us up as all other hotels pickup busses were waiting for there passengers to up Not just that  when we looked for the hotel details on the internet  we found that internet connection is available in the room  but on reaching there  we were informed that no such service is available here  further there was no Mini bar  hairdryer etc  as mentioned on internet  so all those who are traveling  may please make a note of this Further the worst was that after checking out we asked for the taxi  the hotel staff at the gate was very generous to have arranged a taxi for us  but the worst was the destination charge for our place was only DHR    to     but the taxi driver in connivance with the staff made the bill over DHR     which was the worst experience  so never trust any staff in this hotel otherwise you may be cheated The gym and the pool are non functional in the hotel and gym has only one machines and the pool can accommodate only two persons  so you cant expect this facility However the best part was the breakfast  it was fabulous  and the sales manager was nicest person  i have all appreciation for them  
N =>  Stopover What an awesome experience  From checking in to checking out   everything was such a pleasure  the smiles  the courtesy This is a centrally located hotel  within walking distance to the gold souk  it boasts an ice rink     Have a look when next you re in Dubai  you ll be more than pleasantly surprised 
N =>   room too small for   people I think this hotel is not a   star maybe   star or   star  The room a bit too small for   people suitable for single person   we cannot relax in room because it only have one seat  one bathrope and one pair slippers  Oh  the television very old fashion it must be about    years old we will not be back to this hotel 
N =>   It s not a Hyatt It s  star hostel Horrible hotel  Very dirty  stuffy  old  But it s very friendly staff and perfect breakfast  
N =>   The best i have seen for a long time Hyatt regency to me was a very good  frindly hotel I travel a lot  and stay in many hotels  but it was a long time since i had stayed in a real hotel Most hotels  just carry the name and you find lots of weaknessBut hyatt was abseloutly perfect  I enjoyed my staying and i recommend this hotel to any body who thinks that hotel is very important on traveling time  
N =>  Good hotel Good hotel  Friendly staff  Location good   close to the old town  alive with local activity  Not touristy   Next time would stay closer to Dubai Creek  eg  Sheraton  more central   
N =>  Good Customer Service  Good Ambience  amp  Customer Service  Excellent View from the Hotel  NO transport to Emirates Mall which should be taken care by the hotel as emirates mall is too far from the hotel 
N =>   Good Stopping over point A comfortable functional hotel good for business travellers rather than just a holiday hotel  Reasonable restaurants and central to attractions  
N =>  Excellent Hotel but something missing  We stayed at the Hyatt for   night  as part of our Honeymoon trip  On first impressions the Hyatt looked excellent  with a welcoming concierge and a great looking lobby  however when checking in the receptionist staff were a little too pushy to upgrade us  which made us feel a little uncomfortable after a long flight  As we were on Honeymoon we expected a free upgrade  they did say they will upgrade us as we were honeymooners but we would have to pay for this  charming  Must say the room we had was excellent  it was a large room  with a large marbled bathroom  good view of the gulf and with good entertainment  music tv  facilities  One thing I liked was that we were able to select a music channel from the TV set and have this played through the speakers in the bathroom  which was relaxing when having a shower bath  We did eat at the revolving restaurant during the day  which I must say was an experience   very good indeed  The layout of the restaurant was excellent  and the food was just sublime  with a great choice  We also ate at the Shazaad restaurant during the evening  which although had excellent dishes  mixed grills kebabs  lacked any form of atmosphere  The restaurant was pretty much empty   and the entertainment they had  local singer and band  was OK  not what I expected  We also tried the club in the Hotel  which I must say was full of business men looking for young ladies   not what you want  However the music was good  We ended up going to the Trilogy nightclub  which was at the Madinat Jumeirah  this was out of this world  Great club  great house music and the crowd were a mixed bunch   very friendly  The only downfall was the price of drinks All in all  although we had a good time  had an excellent room and the amenities of the hotel were good  there was something missing from the Hyatt  be it seemed too much of a business hotel or the customer services were not as good or the location of the hotel was not that great  being in down town  but there was something missing   which I think may just be the atmosphere  No real atmosphere at all I felt    
N =>   Bad Customer Service I arrived to the Hyatt Regency Dubai on            I was very disappointed  We were not treated friendly at all  I only stayed there for one night and I felt that I was prisoner in my own hotel room  I didn t want to come out because everyone was so mean  To make matters worst  I had extended my stay when I first arrived  All of a sudden  someone keep disturbing me by call my phone over and over  When I finally answered  it was the front desk  tell me that I had    minutes to get out of the room because the had other guest waiting for the room  I was in shock  I explained that I had an extension but they still told me to leave  This was my first time staying at the Hyatt and was not impressed at all  
N =>   Nice hotel shame about the food This is a nice hotel with large room and fantastic views of the creek   The toiletries supplied were rather cheap for a club roomand there was no clock radio as advertised  Also the promised fruit basket only arrived once not everyday as advertised The club lounge was nice with drinks between      and       The staff were all really nice but the only drawback was the food  It was awful  we tried different outlets and they were all bad  The breakfast buffet had very little choice and the hot food was always cold  I read another review saying they had about    fresh squeezed juices well when we were there there was never more than   and they were poured out of plastic bottles  There were no shuttle buses supplied to any of the shopping malls though taxis were plentiful I wouldn t return to this hotel solely because the food was so awful  I have had better food in a   star hotel and this was the worst ever in a   star hotel  
N =>  Good business hotel but location not ideal Third stay at the Hyatt Regency Dubai and a pleasant stay as always  Very friendly staff  rooms are clean if a bit unexciting but they have everything required for a business stay  not that I do much work in my room       Nice bathroom  Good meal to be had in the Japanese restaurant  The one drawback was the    minute wait for a taxi in the morning  In future visits to Dubai I will either book a car the night before or look to stay closer to town in somewhere like the SAS Radisson or Sheraton Dubai Creek  
N => I m not a man  Admittedly the decor  service and all was very good  but it was very businessman aimed  There was nothing much to do and all the shops were aimed at men  hmm    Although I did think the ice skating rink and Baskin amp Robins was pretty cute    
N =>  Just okay  
N =>  Business not Leisure  
N =>   nice views but would benefit from renovation  
N => Galleria Residence   highly recommended  
N =>  rooms outdated  
N =>  Est  dentro do padr o de um hotel   estrelas   
N =>   Ressemble a tous les autres hotels de Dubai sympa mais vraiment isol  du centre  
N =>   Beware the smoking  non smoking  floors    We stayed in the Ibis Al Barsha for   nights in tember       It was the first time we stayed in an Ibis hotel and were a little shocked at just how small the rooms were    but once we got over that we thought the room was nice  clean  the bed comfy and more reasonably priced than most other hotels in Dubai  We had specifically stayed here because of the Ibis  non smoking policy  No smoking in the breakfast area  lobby or anywhere on a non smoking floor  Unfortunately some construction workers were staying in the hotel and were deliberately flouting the non smoking policy and were smoking in their rooms on the non smoking floor     we had to walk through a haze of smoke which was really quite revolting everytime we tried to get to our room     we asked the hotel staff to kindly move the people to a smoking floor every night    and every night they refused    they didn t want to confront them    was pretty dissappointing  The staff at reception were overall pretty useless  However   if they could sort this issue out then I d say its a great hotel to stay in   our breakfast was included and had a good range  
N =>   Suited my needs I ve just returned from a short trip to Dubai  visiting my sister and her family  who live close to this Hotel in Al Barsha  The hotel is very new  only opened in il so everything was new and clean  It is very much a business hotel and there are no leisure facilities or pool The rooms are fairly small  but was fine for a solo traveller and the shower room was ok  although the floor tended to puddle as there wasn t a shower door There were toiletries contrary to what I d read on here Although the hotel is on the busy Sheik Zayed road  my room       was very quiet I thought the breakfast was decent enough although no waiter service  There was a fairly good selection of contintental type things aswell as a few hot items  I didn t eat in any of the restaurants but used the coffee bar which was nice  You are very close to the Mall of the emirates  My only problem was finding a taxi driver who knew where the hotel was  Overall the hotel suited my needs and was very good value for money  
N =>   OK hotel I have just returned from a short trip to Dubai  I was attracted to this property from its low price compared to the other rates for similar hotels in Dubai  Location wise is fine taking into consideration the horrendous traffic of the city   the hotel is located opposite way traffic  next to the Emirates mall  the ina and Jebel Ali  You might find it a bit difficult to get a taxi from the hotel as there is only construction around  Wont take more than      mins wait though Check in was fast   but in very basic English as the Asian staff have really poor English skills  No service in general   you have to carry your own luggage to your room  there is no fridge or safe kit in the room  if you order a snack drink from the restaurant will have to go and pick it up yourself etc  Room was small but contemporary  tiny bathroom  very limited space between the toilet and the shower cabin  no toiletteries in the bathroom  Cleanliness was overall fine  I just noticed once the linen having a small stain  bed lined and towels were changed daily  Breakfast was poor in terms of quantity   they would provide variety such as English breakfast with continental options too  however they would only place for instance   croissants on the plate and once they would be over they would bring new ones  So you actually need to ask from the staff to keep on replacing the food served  I would probably recommend this hotel to those who just need a cheap  comfy property for a sleep without looking for service and all this jazz  
N =>   Simply the place to stay on a budget Me and my ten year old son decided to go for a short trip around the Emirates Arriving late in the evening on Qatar from Frankfurt and Doha I ve looked for a place to stay close to the airport and not that expensive The Ibis fullfilled our needs perfectly  Not more than ten minutes by cab from Terminal   Only a very short wait during check in  The guy there was real friendly and offered us immediatelly after we asked for a room on the eight floor The room was not that large but spacious enough with two separate beds  No airport noise  but it was possible to follow the planes from the window Shower only in the bathroom but clean at all and no noise from the rooms beside Breakfast was also not expensive  buffet style  everything there what we need and alsoreal good to eat outdoor in the warm morning wind Nearly no time to wait during check out and no problem to store our bags there Another plus is the location only some meters around the corner from the entrance to the new and real recommendable new Metro  
N =>   Fine Excellent price  Dhs       Great location  directly opposite Deira City Centre Mall and just down the road from the new metro   Check in was quick  Room was fine  Internet connection worked  Dhs    for   hours   Only disappointment was breakfast  Dhs       not a massive choice  
N =>   Great Location Great Hotel Great service This was my husband and I s first trip to Dubai and didn t really know what to expect  I had read all of the previous Ibis reviews before our trip and was I was not disappointed The reason for our trip was  shopping  shopping  shopping   well my reason anyway   and the hotel is just across the road from one of the best shopping malls in Dubai  in my opinion  The check in service was quick as we were the only people checking in  it was about  am in the morning  All of the staff that we spoke to during our   night stay were kind  friendly and very helpful  There is also a free shuttle bus to the beach which you need to pre book at reception  the times are leaving the hotel at  am or   pm and coming back at  pm or  pm  The beach charges  dhs per person to get in I could not really fault the hotel  our room was big enough for two people  always clean  the bathroom although compact was no problem at all The shopping mall was just outside my window too  just a little word of warning  when you get into the lifts make sure you put your room card in the slot then take out when you see the green light press the required floor otherwise the lift will not move  this was not explained to us at the reception desk but found out by getting stuck in the lift Overall a great hotel  nothing like the Ibis hotels we get in the UK  I would recommend staying here to anyone  
N =>   Not the greatest  We decided to stay at this hotel because we had a decent experience the first time back in ember  It s in a good location and the rooms are new and clean  This time around wasn t the greatest due to the poor service at the front desk  The employees at the front desk were not very accommodating  When we asked them questions it was like we were asking them to go above and beyond their job description  Ming at the front desk was not very helpful  I asked her if it was okay to refund my cash deposit and put it on my credit card instead  She would not take that extra step to help the guest  She simply replied   quot Your transaction has already been processed quot   I went to ask the other employee working at the time and she gladly refunded my money  It was a simple transaction that only took two minutes  The Ibis requires you to pay     AED per night in advance as a deposit  for meals at the restaurant  internet and telephone use etc   If you don t use their services  you would get that money back when you check out  That s a lot of spending money that you could easily use during your stay in Dubai  What good is that money the day you check out and leave Dubai  I explained that to Ming but she didn t seem to want to take that extra two minutes to reverse the cash transaction We also had some trouble the night we checked out  The airport shuttle bus did not arrive at the scheduled time at the hotel  It s supposed to come every half hour  It was    minutes late  When my partner and I asked the front desk about the airport shuttle bus and what the problem could be  the male employee said   quot It will be here in five minutes  quot  After ten minutes  he tried to tell us it already came and left  meaning we were late   We actually waited at the entrance    minutes before the scheduled bus time  meaning we were early    When we told him this  his response was  quot I don t know  quot  and he shrugged his shoulders  Again it seemed like we were asking them to go above and beyond  We asked to speak to the manager and the manager was very helpful  He followed through with the problem and resolved it  The Ibis needs to find employees that actually want to earn their money  instead of lazy ones that hide behind the front desk  We were repeat guests but will look to stay elsewhere the next time we visit Dubai  
N =>  A superb hotel with a budget price A fantastic hotel for a very budget price compared to other hotels of the same level  Even though mentioned as   as well as   star on few websites  i would without any doubt rate it as high end   star  near to    The hotel provided a pickup as well a drop off to the airport  The shuttle runs every    mins in either direction  Staff was very helpful in driving the luggage trolley to even putting the luggage inside the shuttle Hotel room was very clean as if almost ever used  I requested for a good view and got the front of the hotel  Air Con  hot water etc all working as expected  The Deira Shopping Mall is literally across the hotel Buffet Breakfast was included in my package and was very good quality with ample options I would certainly stay there again if i ever went to Dubai  
N =>   Good location and functional basic rooms but customer service is lacking    Booked into the hotel for an initial   night stay  however i ended up staying for   more nights due to business commitments Because i was unsure of length of stay i was extending stay on a daily basis   often confirming verbally with the reception team On the   th afternoon at  pm i received a phone from the hotel to say they were overbooked   claiming people had been sitting in reception for hours with there bags  and as i had not paid for the room i needed to leave immediately  there was no compromise from the manager and he threatened to have the porter to remove my belongings if i did not return in   hour  I had to cancel a meeting and return to the hotel to pack my belongings  I was surprised to see no guests sitting in reception with there bags as was claimed by the manager     however he told me he had booked me a room in there sister hotel  so he seemed to think that was okay and quite reasonable
