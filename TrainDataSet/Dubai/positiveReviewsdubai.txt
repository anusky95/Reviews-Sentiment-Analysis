Perfekt  
Peccato tutti quei cantieri          
Perfect  My husband and I have just returned from our third visit to Madinat Jumeirah resort   we stayed previously in the villas but this time opted for AL Qasr  We worried that the hotel may be second best after the villas but this was not the case  We must thank Daniel for arranging to change us to a room with a better view   the beach staff in particular Rodolfo   who are all most attentive and the drivers of the abras who are all very charming and friendly  The excellent staff are the real asset of this hotel  they are all so helpful and friendly The hotel is beautiful   the location is perfect   the food is delicious and it all adds up to make a perfect holiday experience   We look forward to another trip to the Al Qasr  
Palace of all Palaces To get to the point I will review the Madinat Jumeirah Resort as a whole  As a regular guest since      at this fantastic resort complex on Dubai s best beach  I can only agree      with all the positive comments from other reviews  Whether you choose to stay at Al Qasr  Mina A Salaam or Dar Al Masyaf  you will have the most amazing experience and service beyond excellence  I have been fortunate to have stayed in all   accomodation types apart from the exclusive Royal Villas    I was taken on a tour by one of the managers though   amazing   This is the kind of resort where one feels at home  surrounded by luxury  the most friendly staff and the best location in Dubai  There is no doubt that this resort stands in a class of its own  I will not go into details about all the services on offer as so much has been mentioned before and you can believe it  Take it from me  I have been there    times and will always return   Nothing comes close  
Perfect Honeymoon  We selected the Jumeira resort for our honeymoon based on reviews at Tripadvisor  we had originally booked for Mina Al Salam but upon our arrival we got a HUGE upgrade to Al Qasr The room alone was almost the size of our appartment and very well decorated according to the  quot Arabian quot  theme of the hotel and we even had a private terrace overlooking the canals and Burj Al Arab  Storage facilities were excellent  cable TV was great  many options   room service amazing you could practically order whatever cuisine you could think of  american  Italian  Chinese etc  at any time of the day or night My personal favourite was the bathroon  separate wc  shower and a very cute bathtub big enough to fit both honeymooners The toiletries were renewed sometimes twice a day  and one doesn t need to bring anything at all  they had everything Another fantastic detail was that the hotel corridors and lobby always smelled of jasmin essence  it has an amazing atmosphere  The pool was very nice   the beach service out of this world  the staff always there   and so  so kind and helpfull  beyond any expectation Least but not last  it is really important that being a part of an amazing resort shopping mall meeting point  Al Qasr provides visitors the calm and relaxation of a resort but just a boat trip away you can find shops  amazing restaurants  clubs etcWe are thinking of visiting Dubai again next year on our anniversary and we are definately staying at Al Qasr  PS Ladies only can book a manicure  pedicure or thread hair removal at the Nails INC Salon in the Jumeira Souk  while watching  quot Friends quot  in super comfortable sofa chairs  
Pure Luxury on our Honeymoon If you want pure luxury the Al Qasr is somewhere you should book  Its not cheap but then you get what you pay for  If you want to be fully pampered this is where to go  Around the pool you are fully waited on  Staff coming round to spray evian on your hot face  ask if you would like your sunglasses cleaned and are there to assist your every need  without you having to lift a finger   and they don t expect a tip The hotel is set among a few others  including the burj al arab with water ways and boats to take you to the local souk  It is also a good hotel for celeb spotting  we were sat round the pool with some famous football players and WAGs The hotel is bed and breakfast but there are many retauarnats and bars to choose from  some a little overpriced but here you expect to pay that little bit extra due to the exclusivity The rooms are very grande  clean and have a very comfortable bed  We were greeted with red roses  chocoltaes and champagne on arrival  
Perfect Vacation From the moment you enter this hotel you know you are somewhere special and that you are going to receive quality service  My wife and I do a lot of travelling and have visited numerous top resorts in the world but the Al Qasr surpasses everything we have stayed in to date  The design and layout of the hotel is exquisite  the attention  friendliness and professionalism of the staff superb  If you are looking for an oasis or a place to get away from it all then this is for you  We stayed for a week and normally a week away does not hit the mark for me to get completely relaxed  but here we found ourselves forgetting about our normal lives in a matter of days  It s hard not to when you have such excellent service at every step  Little abra boats take you where you want on the beautiful canals that intertwine the hotels and villas  There are a choice of fabulous beaches to soak up the sun  with a beach service that is second to none  And the views are also breathtaking with the Burg Al Arab in the close distance  There is a sizeable selection of restaurants for dining  and though they may lack in quality for say  Fine Dining  they certainly make up for it in variety of cuisines  It is not the cheapest of places to stay  but it is certainly worth it when you realise that you have had more than just a holiday  you have had an experience  
Paradise found Have just returned from   night at the Al Qasr and feel very depressed  Travelled with my wife and   children     amp     and will definately return  We stayed in the premium leisure part of the hotel and would highly recomend paying the extra  the breakfasts were superb with lots of variety as was the food served in the evening  The swimming pool is the best of the complex and ultra safe given how many life guards are always on duty  The kids loved the kids club  Sinbads  as they could wander in and out as and when they wanted  Sinbads also provided   hours of evening entertainent inlcuding tea for   dhs per child  The food on the whole was very good although we were slighly dissapointed with Nappa and the Thai resteraunts  good food but little choice  The staff are ulta friendly and always more than willing to help  My wife lost her handbag in the Souk and it was found within   hours with everything still in it  including money Overall  an ideal holiday destination to relax and laze by the pool or on the beach even if you have kids in tow  
Perferct for being a tourist Good hotel with excellent staff  very helpful and cheerful  This is not a hotel for people who want to sunbathe all day  but ideal if you want to see the real Dubai and not that far from the Metro  but too far with luggage as we found out Hotel food is good  but don t be afraid to eat in the local cafe s and restaurants  Food is good quality  mainly indian based  and very cheap  but you won t get any alcohol with it  
Pleasant experience for those seeking more true Dubai location The hotel s location is what really distinguishes it from many other Dubai hotels  It is in the center of Bur Dubai  close to the Creek and the Dubai fabulous markets and heritage villages  plus an interesting Dubai Museum  is just in front of the hotel   If you stay in this hotel  you will experience more true Dubai  as it was in the past and where current expatriates live and trade  If you would like great Arabic atmosphere and food walk up along the creek to the heritage village for a very late dinner  not earlier than   PM  and enjoy food and shisha among locals  Arabs  which are hardly seen elsewhere  But if you are looking for easy holidays with private beach and large swimming pool  this is not a place for you   the pool is very small and you need to take taxi to the beach  not a problem though  as we did it every day  As for the hotel itself  it has its own Arabic character  The service  apart from excellent concierge  was just OK  though  The hotel has spa  but after having a    minute complimentary massage there  I felt more stressed than before   do not use it  
Probably the best hotel location to learn about Dubai Since Dubai is still under construction I would stay in this hotel because is located in the old area next to Al BAstakiya historic district and the creek  In my opinion this is the best area if you want to really understand how this city evolved into the ultra modern development it is today  Yes  the new modern hotels are nice  but you won t be able to walk outside the lobby to feel the city like in this hotel  I will return to Dubai in two years to see the majority of the projects completed and would definately return to this hotel TIP  Visit the Bur Juman Mall     minute cab ride  
Pleasant enough     but a   star I paid way too much for this hotel  from their web site  so beware The location of this property is in the Indian Pakistani part of town  you won t see any UAE locals here It is right across from the Dubai Museum which is pleasant enough Plan on taking    to    minutes to obtain a taxi as it is almost impossible to get a taxi right away  The front doormen of the hotel  though  do try to help hail one down The hotel was probably very nice in its heyday  Now it is tired and old  The rooms are of a respectable size however  the bathrooms are alice in wonderland small  The room quality is no more than a two star  if that The staff were all pleasant and friendly  especially at check in There is a Starbucks on property which is a nice touch  however  I noticed that they charged my credit card     for two coffees  Ouch  
Perfect Location This hotel is in a great location for the indian Meena bazaar shopping  The staff are excellent as are the facilities  The rooms are of a superior quality and your are treated to complimentary fresh fruit and dates on arrival  The breakfast which was serviced on the Mezzanine floor served a wide variety of dishes and the waiting staff were pleasant and attentive  The Sherlock Holmes bar is a typical English pub in the hotel   the prices for drinks are a little steep  All in all a pleasant stay  I would return there  
Pleasantly Surprised  I ve worked in Dubai for a while before moving to Bahrain and thought I d visited or seen most of the hotels Dubai has to offer Imagine my surprise when I came across the Arabian Courtyard in Bur Dubai Location wise it s very close to most things of interest in Bur Dubai and only a short taxi ride from the airport and Deira The hotel itself is not opulent compared to others but it still holds a certain charm For service and value for money you would be hard pressed to find a better hotel in such a good location The rooms are nicely decorated in Arabian style  we were upgraded to an executive suite so this report is based on this standard of room  The other good thing about this type of room is you get free food and   quot beverages quot  in the executive lounges on the  th floor The hotel is nicely decorated and has several bars and restaurants including a spar and gymnasium  All in all I would definately go back again  
PURE LUXURY booked to go to Turkey with my family  but after finding a brilliant deal on the Virgin site  we cancelled Turkey and went back to Dubai for the third year running  It was bed  breakfast and free evening meal  After arriving and feeling like royalty when they banged a gong as we entered   we were shown to our room at about      in the morning  We then went out exploring  Beautiful gardens extending the length of the   other sister hotels  The   pools were rarely more than half full  Sam and Michael would keep the children amused for hours before doing aqua aerobics and adult games later on  You could dine at any of the resturants for evening meal and each of them were  st class  all of them catering for children  The location of the hotel was very good  close to everything  Each and everyone of the staff were great  the friendliest in Dubai  About the only complaint I can think of is the high price of alcohol but that can be said for virtually any hotel in Dubai  
Package Tour Nirvana Our stay was   nights on the way back from the Maldives to UK  we wanted to stay elsewhere but left it late and took the agents advice that the Arabian Court was a gem  I asked why it was so cheap if its a gem         Picked up from the airport and taken to the door perfectly  ushered in and they gonged our arrival  lovely  then we checked in with perfect staff in an impressive building   THEN it hit me  a young lady  looked UK and about     walked through reception with a blown up inflatible crocodile  I was amazed  then all sorts of Benidorm types were shuffling through mainly over    and UK looking  We were shown to our rooms   very very good our standard room had all we need apart from a coffee machine  we unpacked and explored for a while   it seems the hotel has a mainly UK clientel of under    or over    and I question the marketing in the UK or maybe they are just desperate to get heads on beds    Overall the hotel is clean  impressive and deserves a better quality of visitor than the ones present when we were there  I am sue they didnt intend to appeal to the under      over    package market as the on site shops had some very pricey quality items for sale If your offered the Court or the Palace in a package holiday at a good deal then you wont be disapointed however if you want a little more exclusivity they you certainly will be  
Pleasantly Surprised After an exhausting flight to Dubai my family and I luckily came across Arabian Dreams Hotel Apartments  ADHA   We generally prefer to stay in Hotel Apartments because the rooms tend to be a lot larger than normail hotels   and to our surprise ADHA had massive rooms  Our two bedroom deluxe apartment had     bathrooms with a fantastic view and lots of closet space  The beds were very comfortable and the full kitchen had clean utensils for us to use The kids had a blast at the rooftop pool area which also had a jaccuzi  The view from the pool was amazing and there was even a steam and suana in the changing rooms  I highly reccomend this property for all long and short term guests because it is so close to the center of Dubai and the airport   especially because for the same rate at other hotels you get much  much larger rooms at ADHA with even better services

Pure luxury  I stayed at the Atlantis hotel for    nights with my husband and our two young children  this was the best   star hotel we have stayed in  The staff were wonderful especially with the children  we were half board which i would recommend as eating in the restaurants was expensive  saffron was our favourite of the restaurants and the kids loved the huge selection of sweets  ice creams  cakes and the chocolate fountain In summary i would recommend this hotel especially to famillies  we shall be going back again next year    can t wait  
Package holiday feel with Dubai prices     over hyped    Staying at the Atlantis has been a bit of a let down  We have spent   previous years staying at the Arabian court  part of the one and only chain and compared to that hotel this has both a different feel and different target market  The hotel is impressive  excellent quality and built to high Dubai standards  However as the hotel owners have obviously decided to recoup their investment as early as possible they have managed to destroy the atmosphere by discounting the rooms to achieve      occupancy  charging for as much as they can during your stay  If you like to queue at breakfast for    minutes or sit less than  mtr away from a stranger on a sunbed around the pool then this is the hotel for you  Over crowded  busy  noisy and too big is how I would describe this hotel  The service is lacking due to the obvious guest numbers and so you often find dinner plates not cleared away or people just waiting for service from anyone  Never once was the main hotel lobby free of lots and lots of people  The atmosphere is one of a cheap spanish package holiday from the late    s  To add to the problem locals are allowed to visit the hotel to view the Lost Chambers or to the Aquaventure for which the hotel charges  The Lost Chambers are in the ground floor of the main hotel so you have lots of passing crowds visiting inside the main hotel I would recommend taking the half board option as the cost of a breakfast for a family of four would be around         However the half board option only allows you to eat in two restaurants both of which are buffet style   of the two the Saffron is the better  The result is considerable over crowding  noise  poor quality and lack of service  the staff work very hard but due to numbers they are hard pressed to deliver   star service  They do have lots of other restaurants but if you have paid for a two week stay and do not opt for the half board option it is likely to add     k to your stay for a family of four  it would be so much better if they allowed you to transfer some of your meal entitlement to other restaurants and allow guests to pay the difference The children do love aquaventure and that is a big lure to the hotel but some locals told me they purchased entry tickets for AED        which is competitive compared to Wild Wadi  Drinks are amazingly expensive and that includes water and soft drinks Compared to the Jumierah Beach or the One  amp  Only Royal Mirage this hotel comes third in atmosphere but top in charges    
PRICY BUT AMAZING  GREAT FACILITIES The Atlantis was amazind as you drove up to it under the tunnel on Palm Jumeirah  We were escorted to the check in desk and there was a huge sculpture  The staff were attentive and the rooms were great    we got upgraded   The pools were clean and tidy  Every day thay gave free ice creams and cold face towel  The food and drink was very expensive  We had a Bed and Breakfast package with took    Dirhams times   per day off food  Aquaventure was amazing the slides and rapids were great for families and it was free for resort guests around    Dh    Dh for families of         It was very fun  There was a golf buggie which took guests around the resort as it was very hot  Dolphin bay was availible if you wanted to swim with Dolphins  fee   There also was an aquaruim called the Lost Chambers which was good  it was free for resort guests     Dh     Dh aprox for familief of         There was a monorail which ran up and down the palm which was good  The hotel was great and I would go there again  
Perfect family holiday From arriving at the airport  you realise that Dubai doesn t do anything by halves  The service from private car to the hotel  to the check in  everything went very smoothly  We went straight to breakfast as we had travelled throught the night  and it was a very extensive buffet with everything from a full English to Dimsum and local speciallities We were relieved that we had a bed and breakfast package though as each day would have cost us over      for   The hotel lobby is very impressive but nothing compared to the West tower and the aquarium as you approach which had a serious wow factor as you come out of the lifts The waterpark is included in the price of the hotel and we spend hours there  Apart from the Friday  this park was not too busy and we didn t have to wait long for anything  All the slides were great and the rapids refreshing  Plenty of shade helped I would whole hearted recommend the Desert Safari which many companies offer  You  WD out in the desert and end up at a  camp  where Arabian BBQ  sandboarding  camel rides  henna ing  are all on offer  Music and bellydancing complete the experience  Although the restaurants in the hotel are expensive  but very good  the taxis are very plentiful  metered and cheap so it is easy to go to a local souk for a meal Just beware  a  cheap  bottle of wine could set you back around     We had a blast  and would happily return  
Perfect for children It s bold  it s brash  its great for kids My two children    and    loved the following best  the fish  the waterpark and the chocolate fountain  at breakfast   It s a fantastic place for a beach holiday especially if you have young children and don t mind the heat  The two vast pools are perfect for children and the setting is fantastic with views from the Royal Pool back to Dubai  Located at the end of the Palm the front of the hotel looks out to sea  You can also use the hotel beach  where swimming in the sea is like taking a warm bath  The enormous aquarium is the main feature of the hotel and is the biggest fish tank I have ever seen  It s mesmerising  Residents have free entry into Lost Chambers  which is an extension of the aquarium boasting numerous rooms enabling you to view all sorts of sea life  It s amazing  Residents at the Atlantis also have free entry into the enormous adjacent waterpark  You have to brave the heat and not hang around too much if you come at the end of  but once the children had walked into the park to Splashers they loved it  And there are loads of other water rides to keep everyone happy  The hotel is vast  with numerous expensive but exquisite restaurants  We ate on the beach one night and I experienced some of the most sensational flavours ever  eating the cold and hot mezze at Levantine  the Lebanese restaurant  I would definitely recommend this place to friends with families or friends who don t mind lots of children                        
Perfect weekend    Spent a long weekend over Valentine s and had the best time  We were upgraded to a suite  which was huge and had every amenity you can imagine  The hotel is amazing   we have stayed all over the world  but this place is impressive  We could have spent a week there and never left the resort water park  Kids  ages    and    loved it and hated leaving  Highly recommend booking the dolphin experience  Expensive but worth it  
Play ground for the rich and famous The hotel was amazing from when you first step into the lobby with the elaborate glass sculpture  the staff were very helpful and could not do enough for you  carrying bags  opening doors  I admit that the rooms and house keeping were a little dissapointing but the hotel  staff and facilities are fantastic  The lost chambers and water park really set this hotel apart from the rest in Dubai  I did not try the restaurants at the hotel as the prices were very high and there are so many other great places to eat that are reasonable but did venture into the night club  The Sanctury whcih was lovely with great music It is certainly a hotel that I would recomend but would not stay there again as once is enough to experience its magic  
Perfect   I ve been in Dubai since uary for business and will stay until end y  I bumped into this hotel by luck as I wasn t especially looking for an hotel appartment    Service here is always great  and even though it s an hotel  rooms are furnished enough to look like it s home   And location is very convenient  close to the beach and to main roads   amp  neighbourhood is full of restaurants and local souqs So  strongly recommended either for business or leisure   D 
Pretty good experience What can I say about the Burjuman Suites  Rooms are a great size  no complaints about the room at all  The breakfasts had an extensive selection and the waiting staff were very friendly and polite  The downside would have been the swimming pool was part of the Fitness First gym and access was sorta complicated  Plus there was no sun at the pool area after     am   so not a place to stay if you want a tan  The tours trips organised through the hotel were very expensive and not great quality and the drivers we had didnt speak a word of English  So book them on the internet before you go and save yourself some money Was in UAE last year and things are a lot more expensive  but hardly a reason to badly rate the hotel  Go and enjoy the great location  the lovely mall next door  savour the heat and the great little cafe at the front of the Burjuman Mall   Paul s  The best food I had in all the time I was there and a great place to watch the world pass you by  
Pure elegance and absolute luxury The Burj is still the most amazing looking hotel in amongst the skyline of new and upcoming buildings  The Burj is very close to the Emirates Mall and well located to visit Butta Mall and the marina  Although the Burj stands alone  all the Jumeirah properties are connected and as a Burj guest you can visit any of the properties for any reason quite easily via buggy  It is much easier that in previous years to move around the Jumeirah properties  but if you are not a guest of the Burj it is much harder to visit the Burj unless you have a reservation  Even as a guest your name and suite number is always checked before you enter the bridge to ensure that only guests get through We have stayed at the Burj numerous times  and each time our expectations are far exceeded  We arranged for a transfer which was absolutely faultless  As usual we were presented with a gleaming car readied with chilled bottled water  cold towels and I was presented with a beautiful bouquet of roses  The driver was very pleasant  ensuring that the AC was set nicely for us  and happy to let us listen to the radio instead of their selection of CDs Arriving at the Burj came with the usual grandeur of being able to by pass the queue of traffic waiting to enter the bridge  and doorman fussing to help us out of the car  As usual we were met by the hotel front of house staff and presented with rose water  sweet dates and a cold towel  then whisked straight up to our suite  The lobby of the Burj never fails to impress with the colours of the floors graduating skywards  gentle music playing in background  and rhythmic patter of the fountain This time we stayed a panoramic suite  The finish of the suites are all of the same standard  really the only thing that differs is the size of the suite and the amazing floor to ceiling windows The solid wooden suite door opens onto a beautiful marble hallway leading to a study area and a stunning winding staircase to the bedroom  The panoramic windows floods the suite with light and makes the room feel extremely big  The entire suite is lavishly decorated with rich colours and lots of gold trim  beautifully matching the character of the hotel and the region  The living area comprises of many sofas and seating areas with a very large TV and entertainment system  a dinning area  a fully stocked bar area complete with bar stools  The study area comes complete with laptop  printer and stationary all ready for use  In addition there is a wc and an extremely large under stairs storage area  The room control system has been updated and is much easier to use and there is now a Ipod sound system  which unfortunately is not integrated to the room s speakers but is nice to have Upstairs there is a massive bathroom with his and hers sinks  a huge spa bath and massive shower  In addition full size Hermes products are also provided as well as an array of other useful things  such as toothbrushes  shaving kits  hair combs  The dressing area is well lit with large mirrors and ample wardrobe space  The bedroom is beautiful with amazing views  And at night  the turndown service leaves a little gift such as La Ric creams or yummy little chocolates The technology in the suite is pretty impressive with the TV remote controlling everything including the curtains and door access  The updated system is much easier to use and much more responsive than the old system  And the new Do Not Disturb system is much better now and actually does not allow the staff to override the system and enter the room  as it use to  The TV does everything  including providing internet access and is a video entry system Unfortunately we did not have our usual butler  however  the three butlers that we did come across were perfectly polite and could not do enough to ensure that we were comfortable and enjoying our stay  Each floor also has a floor manager who works in tandem with the butler to ensure that your stay in going smoothly  All staff around the hotel seem to know your name and will always greet you with a smile  You can approach any one of them for any reason and the query problem will always be sorted without any fuss  During this visit  my husband celebrated his birthday  He had lovely surprise when our butler accompanied by two other butlers came into our room with a gorgeous chocolate cake and with one of the butlers playing the guitar  they sang happy birthday to him  It was so lovely and especially thoughtful as we hadn t mentioned that he would be celebrating his birthday during the stay  Staff throughout the hotel randomly came up to him to wish a happy birthday too which added to the day The food at the Burj is still lovely  There are so many restaurants to choose from for any meal  but in particular we love the breakfast buffet at Bab al Yam by the pool  we tend to have lunch by the pool or on the beach   would highly recommend trying the wagu burger or seafood pizza at the pool or on the beach  We also had dinner at sui which was a fantastic experience of making your own way round    cooking stations where they make everything including the sushi and sashimi in front of you  Service was fantastic and discreet and the atmosphere relaxed Al Hambra at Al Qsar is also still extremely good  as is room service  The menu selection is quite large and is always delicious  In addition  every afternoon a selection of canap s were offered in our suite   As this hotel is a massive tourist attraction  early afternoons and evenings are busy in the hotel with people coming to visit  There are however lots of staff on hand to keep tourists away from guests  but it is a little annoying when you can t get through the crowd posing for photos at the water fountain  However  once you get to the lift and up to your floor  tranquillity is quickly restored Overall this is an astonishing hotel and is still my absolute favourite of all those I have ever visited across the world  The hotel deserves its   star reputation  It provides absolute luxury  but in a relaxed way   the level of thought that goes into ensuring that we had the most perfect stay is amazing  Staff beckon to your every call if you want them too  or they will simply leave you to enjoy yourself while working discreetly to add little indulgent touches to make your stay even more surprising and even better than the day before  I would highly recommend a stay   everyone should enjoy this little piece of this luxury   at least once  
Pretty Classy       
Perfect hotel for transit The Sofitel Dubai City Center is the perfect hotel for short stays in Dubai  Only   min from airport  has shuttle bus  The rooms are very quite but standard and all is in working order  Inexpensive Internet service for laptop avlbl  Nice roof top pool with snack bar Excellent restaurants at reasonable prices which serve alkohol  Very well trained international staff that is friendly and efficient Great hotel for business and transit passenger at a good rate  
Poor staff attitude I stayed at this hotel in ch       Despite having a reservation guaranteed for late arrival  pre paid   when I arrived at the hotel at  pm it was full with no room for me  I was housed overnight in some nearby apartments which were not  in my view  of the same standard  As it was late  I went along with it expecting the next day I might receive some sort of apology or recompense from the hotel  Far from it  Instead I found the staff to be surly and unresponsive when I raised my concerns  Based on my experience  this is a hotel to be avoided  unreliable in honouring its bookings and with a poor attitude to its customers  
Perfect little Apartments for our stay in Dubai  The Sofitel Apartments were more than perfect for us  We had a two bedroom  two bath  living room  kitchen area with two balconies  This was more than enough for   adults  two children and the maid  Very clean and spacious with modern conveniences and decor  The staff in the lobby should have been friendlier  but they weren t horrible    just stuffy  The Apartments were just like a little home away from home    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED   
Plutot un   etoiles  
Poor Facilities Poor Service Very disappointed I stayed this year in ruary at City Seasons in Dubai and was very disppointed  I knew it was in the business area of Dubai and far away from the beach  but hoped for a nice swimmingpool to chill out  They have a swimming pool but no sunshine  because it is build at the wrong side and there is no way that you will have any sun  except from   till    o clock in the morning  great  Also the gym facility was very poor  Half or actually all of the machine did not work  except one of them and there was no one who actually looked after and explained anyting  The service at the reception and in overall was very disappointing and not helpful at all  The rooms are clean and tidy but the customer service and facilities are very poor  My opinion  Not worth the money  
Perfect I choose this hotel for the price and the location and it was a really good thing  the hotel is just few minutes by walk from the Mall of Emirates  You need to take the taxi  that you find very easily  to go in the city but it s really cheap     dirhams to go to the Burj Al Arab and    to go to Jumeirah Beach Park  For now on there is no construction around the hotel  on its block  The swimming pool is really nice and there is always someone to help you around I had a studio which was very clean and big enough for a person The employees are really nice to youJust that if I go back to Dubai  I would choose this hotel back without doubts 
Perfect and good value We spent less for a five star room here than in other places in Dubai and it was perfect  outstanding room  good service  magnificent view  The places to see in Dubai can be easily reached by taxi for a reasonable fare and the double deck tourist bus stops there  It is close to a huge shopping center where there is a very broad choice of restaurants  Definitely recommended  
Poor hotle Stayed for   nights on route to Japan   in exec rooms  If this is a    then I am the queen  Hotel not too clean  in fact they could do with employing people of work as there are millions of staff just standing around doing nothing  Standard way below what I would have expected for paying      per night  Exec area average  very Smokey and lower paid staff friendly but others need lessons in customer servicePool OK but again servie not good  Never once asked if I wanted a drink or towels  all seems too much effort Would not stay here again 
Perfect This place is complete paradise  You have everything right at your fingertips  Butler service makes sure of it   and at the same time you still have a great deal of privacy  A ton of amazing restaurants to choose from along with nice and trendy lounges  Super clean pools and beach  Very beautiful and very calm  Huge property    be prepared to walk  take a buggy or  boat   Close to great shopping and even more great restaurants  
Phenomenal My colleague and I had meetings in Dubai for a week and were going to stay at the one and only     after some research  and comments from this site  we decided on Dar al Masyaf and are so glad we did    the service is great  the location is the best by far  the food was great  The entire property has everything you could want from shopping  eating  relaxing etc  The rooms are great    we didn t want to leave and plan on coming back  
Perfect We stayed in DAM in y  amp  ember last year  All I can say is it is utterly perfect  from arrival to departure  I would recommend the resort for all people  Dubai can be anything you want it to be from a busy holiday to a relaxing holiday  And this resort offers everything you could possibly want  our favourite evenings were spent in the Souk  eating at the Lebanese cafe  Can not fault the service in any area  especially the gents on the Abra s lovely  amp  friendly  Talise Spa  though a bit high in price  is heaven  we left feeling soo chilled out and refreshed  We are looking forward to returing again this e with friends  So if your planning a holiday here  I m sure you will enjoy everyminute of it  The only fault for me was having to leave    
Perfect in nearly every way  This was our fourth visit to Dubai but our first stay at the Dar Al Masyaf  I have little to add to the previous comments  other than to say the Hotel is truly wonderful  very relaxing  with a wonderful laid back atmosphere and truly lived up to  and exceeded our expectations  All the staff were very friendly  helpful and it appeared  very happy to be working at the DAM  The design of the hotel is amazing  incredibly well maintained and beautifully lit at night  Rooms are very large and comfortable with beds and linens that put Westin s heavenly beds to shame  Happy hour free drinks are a great way to meet other guests and the butler service is like having a personal concierge who will arrange restaurant bookings etc  Very small points are there is not a lot of drawer storage space  no shaving mirrors in the bathroom  and bedside lights that you cannot really read by  and prices are on the high side     for a bottle of water  but these are all very minor  Very good wide breakfast selection  although it never varied so it became a little repetitive  Getting around the resort can be a pain  especially in the heat  but if you plan and ring ahead for buggies and abras it reduces the amount of waiting around you have to do  otherwise    minute waits for them at peak times wasn t uncommon  With    restaurants within the complex  it appeared that many guests never left the hotel but it is worth making the effort to explore beyond the Madinet as there are is huge range of restaurants and bars with much better prices in Dubai  
Prepare to be spoilt  I had read good things about this hotel  but i was not prepared for the amazing level of personal service  it was astounding and made us feel like superstars  Hotel is top class  and decor amazing and feels like you are in a foreign culture unlike some of the other chains in Dubai  There are arabic influences everywhere  and the rooms are sumptuous  Bathroom was gorgeous  with complimentary bathrobes  slippers  nightly turndown service and personal butler  We loved our time here  and would definitely return  The only thing to be aware of is that eatting anywhere in the hotel is astronomical  by aussie prices anyway   like           per main  Wine is very expensive also  but then we are spoiled here in Australia with great cheap wines  Breakfast buffet at     pp must be done at least once  it is the best I have seen  A very nice stopover enroute to Europe  We took the hotel limo from Abu Dhabi airport  cost      wasnt cheap but worth it for the convenience and superstar treatment  
Perfect balance between big resort amenities and villa peace seclusion This was our second trip to Dubai  first trip last ust  and our first trip staying at Dar Al Masyaf or any hotel in the Madinat Jumeirah Resort The whole Madinat Jumeirah Resort is gorgeous  An ever so slight  Vegas  feeling  i e  on such a grand scale and everything done to the max   but delivered with amazing class and attention to detail  No matter where you go in the resort  you are rewarded with a beautiful vista The Madinat Resort consists of two sizeable hotels  Al Qasr and Mina A Salam  and the villas  Dar Al Masyaf  as well as the Royal Villas  Malakiya Villas   The hotels and villas are connected together by golf buggies and abras  little boats which run around the resort s scenic waterways   As a guest at Dar Al Masyaf  you can use the facilities  pools  tennis and gym etc  and the restaurants  including for breakfast  at any of these hotels The resort is also part of a larger collaboration with the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  the Burj Al Arab and Wild Wadi  One of the resort s golf buggies will take you between any of these places and you can charge meals purchases directly to your room  As a guest at the resort we were given complimentary access to Wild Wadi and allowed entrance an hour earlier than the general public   both of which were valuable At Dar Al Masyaf  the rooms are arranged in villas  a small number of rooms   about      are arranged around a central courtyard  and each villa has its own reception area and butler  to check you in out  to make reservations  to call golf buggies and generally look after you   Complimentary drinks are served in the villa reception area between   and  pm each evening The villas and rooms require some getting used to   they are quite different to the modern  hi tech styles of most    European US hotel rooms  However  they are beautiful  peaceful  secluded and full or Arabic charm  photos do not do them justice  They felt like a very suitable choice of accommodation for a holiday in Dubai  The bathrooms are HUGE   almost as big as the bedroom  There was a large double ended bath  a sizeable walk in shower  a separate WC and a dressing area  The king sized bed was very comfortable  Rooms included a DVD player and a safe  Each evening turndown service would leave a little gift  chocolate  lip balm or massage oil etc  and sometimes a towel animal  The only real down sides were that internet access was expensive   about     a day   and that there were no sockets near any of the mirrors  so difficult to straighten your hair  We were in Villa   and had an Ocean Deluxe in a Gulf Summer House  Great  light  quiet room with lovely view across to the beach  This villa was in an excellent location  right on the beach  very close to the Madinat Souk  fairly close to the Mina A Salam  great breakfast  very nice pool and for the Quay Leisure Centre   fairly close to the main Al Qasr pool  and a nice bar for lunch and another breakfast venue   If we wanted to go anywhere further a field  we would phone the butler to request a golf buggy and one would be waiting at the front door of the villa before we got there   very convenient Staying at Dar Al Masyaf is a great combination of both worlds  you have very convenient access  and charging rights  to a huge amount of facilities and restaurants  but you can escape to your own peaceful  secluded retreat at your villa  
Paradise found   quot Absolutely magnificent  quot We have just returned from a    day holiday in Dubai  The weather was very hot getting up to    degrees most days  and humidity high with a warm during the night  Some days there was a breeze  but not enough to cool you down  When we got out of the airport we thought we had made a mistake  the heat took our breath away  but the next day we found we were soon accustomed to it We stayed in a Dal Al Masyaf ocean view Villa  The villa s sit in a brilliant position directly on the beach  A pathway causeway  seperates the villa from the beach  The path either walked or by buggy eventually meanders to the Burg Al Arab  The resort itself  is part of the Madinat group of hotels which means luxury  where ever you go to  Guests are able to use any of the facilities at the Mina  A Salam  and Al Qsar and the Jumeriah Beach hotels  The resort is huge  All of the hotels are absolutley luxurious  The Al Qsar and Mina a Salam is surrounded by a waterway  The hotels have about    resturants between them  You can get around the resort by taking an  quot Abra quot  a small eletric powered boat  or a golf buggy  During the day  cold hand towels and fruit sticks are hounded out to guests around the pool and beach Connecting to the hotels is a Souk  full of very quaint shops  and fully air conditioned  People are very freindly and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff  who are well trained  The people we spoke to are happy in their roles All of the shopping malls are fantastic  however I found most goods simelar in price to the UK  even though it s is supposed to be tax free   Sales items are the best buys obviously  most malls have reduced goods  The Emirates Mall has a   storey Ski Slope with real snow  the most amazing thing to see  The slopes are visable though a glass wall  This is   minutes by taxi The food in the resturants is very good  even if you are dining casually  I recommend seafood  which is caught fresh each day and truly delicious  A reasonable meal will cost in the region of        for two people  Most returatnts include gratuity of     We loved the Koubar Bar in the Al Qsar it overlooked the Burg  and Jam Base a Jazz club  in the Souk  Breakfast is buffet style and there is nothing you cannot get The sea is crystal clear and like taking a warm bath It is our second time in Dubai  but first time at this resort  it is certain we will be returning again next year  We could not fault anything  We are fairly well travelled and have not found service and quality  anywhere else the same We loved it   Lincolnshire 
Parfait    
Perfect      We stayed at Delmon Hotel for   nights  I had read that I should avoid the  nd floor because of the noise of the disco  so when we went at      in the morning to check in  I told them not to put us at the  nd floor  The surprise  They gave us a deluxe suite on the  th floor   WOW    It was amazing  The staff is perfect  very efficient and polite  They will service you the best  Breakfast is OK  it has a dinner buffet for only    dhs   euro per person  it really deserves the money you pay  The location is just perfect for Deira  You can go to Deira City Centre in a    minutes walk  Also there is a super market near the hotel  If we come back to Dubai we will stay for sure at Delmon Hotel      
Probably the best hotel I ve stayed in    I ve been lucky enough to have stayed in some of the world s best hotels  My previous favourite was the Sanderson or Brown s in London  Now it s here  Superb place  right on the polo fields  And great value if you book on the internet   about a third of the rate that they quote if you book direct  Would be lovely for a couple  although I don t think I had the couples room  my colleague was right next door but had a room with the bed facing out onto the pologrounds Awesome bathroom and bath  amazing sound system  huge  beautiful room  Can t speak highly enough about it  
Perfectly fine   star with great service I stayed at the Dubai Grand for one night in transit  and it is what it professes to be  a   star hotel  The decor in the rooms is more London B  amp  B than Dubai modern  but the rooms were very comfortable  The staff were very helpful with tourist and banking information  and let you know the approximate time and cost of taxi journeys The Dubai Grand is very close to Terminal    and about a  US   taxi to Terminal    
Pricey but worth it ided to use the Hotel to manage my   hour stop over in Dubai on a return journey The whole experience was fantastic    the staff were very efficient and friendly  the room was amazing  vey luxurious with toiletries  fruit  coffee and tea making facilities and very  very quiet   what you need if you fly economy like me  The only negative side was the price but you need to weigh it up over sitting on hard chairs at best  lying on floors at worst and based on how long your connection time is For me it was well worth it and I would use it again  
Perfect stopover budget hotel We have recently returned from our first visit to Dubai  where we spend three nights at the a on the recommendation of Trip Advisor contributors  We were looking for something cheap and cheerful to use as a jump point to our onward journey to Europe  The hotel staff were very pleasant and all parts of the hotel were extremely clean  Our room was massive  with a separate anti room and bathroom  however we did not have a window  This was not really a problem as we simply wanted a clean place to stay and the shower was great  Lots of hot water and pressure  We were on the third floor and at the  back  of the hotel so everything was whisper quiet  This is a budget hotel   however it suited our needs perfectly  The bonus for me was the breakfast  This hotel is in the old part of town   Indians rather than Arabians   and breakfast reflected this  After the first morning of having hot milk on cornflakes we opted for the Indian   naan bread and three different curries  I was in heaven  My other half had an omelete each morning   individually made with fillings of his choice  Being situated in the old part of Dubai we were able to walk everywhere and were two minutes from the textile souks and a short water taxi  A     from the gold and spice souks  The hotel is across the road  almost  from the Dubai Museum  which is definitely worth a visit   spend       hours there  
Pleasantly Surprised    We were a bit tired after arriving in Dubai at  am and being taken to the wrong hotel by the taxi driver  After being told that this hotel was a bit out near the airport we were slightly reluctant to take the trip  We walked in the door and there was a friendly smiling face waiting for us  The check in was quick and smooth  When we walked through the halls to our two bedrooms apartment everything looked and smelled brand new  We opened the door and we were blown away by how large and beautifully furnished and arranged our place for three nights were  The living room was beautiful  each bedroom had its own full bathroom an extra half bath in the hall next to a laundryroom with a combo washer dryer and a huge full kitchen  We thought we had hit the jackpot  Our fears were put to rest and we relaxed and had a wonderful time there  Free buffet breakfast daily and the shuttle took us to MALL OF EMIRATES as requested  I would definitely stay there again    
PERFECT HOLIDAYS I stayed at Fortune hotel in       with my husband  and was very suttisfied   Therefore this year  I decided to book the same hotel  I am very happy I did this  was very happy with the assistance  of the entire hotel  reception breakfast room service Room was clean and tidy any extra I needed people were happy to serve  I had my little baby with me     months  and everyone was very helpfull and kindHotel area is very good only   minutes walk you can find supermarket  macdonalds nandos burger king  pizza restaurants starbucks restaurants I will definately use the same hotel during my next visit to Dubai  
Poor Service I stayed with my wife and son in this hotel for   nights during the Eid holidays  I liked the location  easyly accessible  We were very upset with services  first they provided us with a twin sharing room inspite of booking almost a month before for a double room and a response  if you want take it attitude from the manager  Till the end of the stay they could not provide an extra bed for my kid inpite of requesting every day and they could not fix the locker til the last day  We overall had a very happy vacationin dubai exept for the hotel  
Pourrait faire mieux  
PERFECT   Wouldn t stay anywhere else Me and my friend stayed at the hotel for   nights for a short break in Dubai  We were two females and so wanted a secure place in a good location  In a nutshell the hotel was a perfect base to explore the city The hotel was a       min drive from the airport and taxi drivers never had a problem finding the property  Check in was very smooth and our twin room was ready for us on arrival  Staff were always very polite  The hotel has a rooftop pool and a pool bar with amazing views of the city esp  at night  A gym and sauna room are also located on the rooftop  Our room was a good size  see pix  with a minibar  hair dryer  iron and iron board  kettle and complimentary tea coffee supplies  LCD tv  coffee table and  x chairs  Complimentary bottles of water were provided every day and was very helpful and the room was serviced to perfection on a daily basis  The bathroom was of a good size  see pix  and contained the usual amenities  Staff at the concierge desk were extremely helpful  We got most of our local information from them and they also booked our safari tour with just   days notice at no extra cost  They sell postage stamps aswell  A free shuttle bus to Dubai mall and Jumeira beach is available thought it has a limited service  The location of the hotel is particularly good for a tourist  There is a metro station  financial centre    mins away and taxis are very easily available  Next door to the hotel is a Nando s and KFC that are open till   or   am  Down one block is a Subway that is open    hrs and further down is a McDonalds and TGI s    min walk max   The eatieries come in very handy given that you might be shopping till late  Small grocery type stores are located behind the hotel where you can stock up on water and drinks  I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning on visiting Dubai  
Picture Perfect  We stayed for   nights   th   th  its was great  We arrived early morning and we were allowed to check in early at no extra charge  Hotel staff are very friendly  The room is spacious  clean I cannot fault it great value for money  Location is in the centre of all local hot spots and taxis are easily available  You must must must go on the desert safari   And also the open beach in Dubai ina is fantastic  I would stay here again and highly recommend the hotel to anyone  Oh and I almost forgot the roof top pool with breathtaking views of Dubai  
Perfect  I loved this hotel and would definitely stay again  The first couple of nights I booked a two bed two bath apartment  It came fully equipted with a wash dryer  dinning room  kitchen  stove  oven  microwave  fridge  and dishwasher   a balcony that you could enter through the living room and or kitchen  The last two days of my stay I rented a one bed suite  Everything as stated with the two bed two bath was included with the exception of having a dryer and dishwasher  The staff was very friendly and accommodating  Also  this hotel is located in a good area  You can walk to the Karama shopping area  the mall as well as the supermarket and depending on which Golden Sand you stay in  I stayed in    and    you are also near the Mena shopping area  
Perfect stay at Golden Sands   This was our second visit to Dubai and after staying at the Movenpick last year  we thought we would stay in a more  local  hotel   the Golden Sands   The only slight downside to the GS  is the slightly faded poolside areas   the  st floor pool also loses the sun around  pm Everything else was fantastic   just what we expected after reading other reviews on Tripadvisor The room was very spacious with a seperate kitchen and living area    rooms in total plus bathroom   the restaurant food was excellent  both in the restaurant and room service  There is a free shuttle bus to the Hilton Jumeirah Beach Resort each day  bus is free but admittance to the resort is    Dhm   about       which is well worth it  and also to and from the airport The staff were so friendly and helpful  allowing us to check in on arrival at     am  after a terrible flight   and the restaurant staff were always happy to chat and go out of their way to help in any way they can All in all  I would heartily recommend GS  to anyone and will certainly be going back there in years to come  
Pleasant and Comfortable We were very happy with our stay Golden Sands    The apartment was spacious  clean and nicely furnished  The kitchenette had all utensils crockery etc needed and most importantly the aircon worked very well  Both pools were quiet and pleasant  The staff were polite and helpful  There is a shop nearby to buy any essentials food needed  We didn t eat in the restaurant though it looked OK  There is a shuttle bus to the airport every   hours and also to the beach  The hotel was fine   Its just a shame about the hot  dusty charmlessness of any outdoors parts of Dubai  
Plesant stay Stayed   nights in Golden Sands    Great value for money  Everything we needed  clean and confortable studio  Helpfull staff  always taxis up front  free internet  walking dist to huge shopping center and grocerystore  Free shuttlebus to the beach every day and also to the airport  Newspaper at the door every morning Only thing I do not recomend is the breakfast  Never saw any of the girls others mentioned in their reviews  I would go again and do recomend others  Guess I would call it touristclass  
Pleasant Stay  We had two nights in Dubai as part of a stop over  This hotel is huge   We walked around part of the grounds and it took us about ten minutes to get to the lobby and I think were were only half way round it  We didn t use the pool but it looked great  spacious and very clean     restaurants to choose from within the lobby   we had a lovely meal in the Indian Restaurant  It is more of a business hotel so the rooms are functional but the bathrooms are massive  Very comfortable bed  Good breakfast choices  Concierge were exceptionally helpful in planning our whirlwind two day tour of Dubai  
Perfect for Business Perfect for business travellers 
Probably one of the best hotels in Dubai From the different hotels I visited in Dubai  the Grand Hyatt was probably on of the very best for its interior design  its general atmosphere  its cleanliness and its staff The lobby is just amazing  behind the lounge bar on a mezzanine  there is a huge indoor jungle  with rivers and bridges  The indoor pool is elegant and big enough to swim  The outdoor pool  located in a pretty garden  is really big and beautifully lighted when it s dark Rooms are spacious  well equipped and perfectly clean We tried two restaurants  the Indian one which was very good and the  quot ket quot  offering an extensive breaksfast buffet along the indoor jungle There are plenty of employees around the entrance and in the front desk or the concierge office  Each of them friendly and helpful  they really do everything they can to make you enjoy your stay I give Grand Hyatt Dubai only four stars for its location because it is not right in the center of the activities  but has Dubai ever a center     although it is only    minutes far from the airport  car or taxi  and five minutes from the Wafi mall  walk  And I give this hotel only four stars for its value because it is quite expensive  But there again  it has to be tempered by the fact that all great hotels in Dubai have very high rates  They will probably have to reconsider their rates as bookings tend to decrease due to the global crisis    
Perfect resort hotel  without beach  I stay at Grand Hyatt Dubai once a year    and after   years still find it a nice hotel to spend a few relaxing nights  It s a big hotel but don t let the      rooms withold you of staying here   Once in the hotel you never get the impression that it s crowded  the lobby is big enough   still impressive the   enormous boat keels that hang in the lobby   the staff take their time to welcome you and guarantee a quick and hassle free check in  The rooms are nice and big with of course all the usual amenities of a    hotel  TV  internet  safe  bathrobe  huge soft fluffy towels      Rooms are carpeted  bathroom has tiles Nice clean marble bathroom with shower  no bath   separate wc and bidet  However the little trays with the bathroom amenities are getting a little worn out  There are quite some restaurants here and my favourite still is  quot The Peppercrab quot   an asian fusion cuisine but oh so lovely and tasty presented    For cheap  amp  quick try  quot The ketplace quot   where also breakfast is served  You can get a decent meal for around    Euro per person  it s divided into   open kitchens where you will find tasty asian  indian and italian dishes  The hotel has a huge garden with swimming pool  amp  poolbar  covered childrens pool  Spa  jogging track and other sports facilities  I fell asleep by the poolside one afternoon and when I woke up the poolbar was just closing but the waiter still came over and asked me if I wanted to order drinks  I find this hotel a perfect resort hotel  the only thing it doesn t have is a beach  amp  seaview  But who needs this with Wafi Shopping center  amp  cinema s only   min  away on foot  yes you can walk to Wafi  I recommend this hotel for business purpose  consider bringing your partner  children along  and normal tourists too  
Perfect Break After a lot of research finally settled on the Grand Hyatt  Very glad we did  Its has quite a lot of business people but the advantage is that for a family on a holiday you have the amenities to yourselves  The pool area is huge and fantastic  The kids clud was great for our toddler  and the spa was really relaxing  We had no reason to leave the hotel and when we did  we were looking forward to getting back as it had everything Service and food very good  and we would definitely go back next time we visit Dubai  
	Percent FANTASTIC  We just completed a   night stay at the Grand Hyatt Dubai  In short  completely excellent  I would not hesitate to return nor would I hesitate to recommend this property without reservation If anything stood out about this property  it was the service  This is the kind of place where small kindnesses abound  For example my morning routine would call for a swim in the spa pool followed by a Jacuzzi  steam  sauna and shower  I always did this right at  am when they opened  jet lag    month old baby   and was for   times the ONLY person in the pool or spa at this time  other than people in the workout room   The attendants were  setting up  and busy  but nevertheless would go out of their way to be helpful  For example  every day the gentleman in the spa would come into the steam room behind me and place a sachet of aromatic herbs into the steamer  Kindnesses were not limited to the spa  A few times cleaning people in the huge atrium would drop what they were doing to help my wife and I get the stroller up or down a small set of stairs  People smiled  They routinely said hello  In the Grand Club nothing we needed was too much trouble  By the pool they circulate with cold towels  slices of cucumber for the eyes  and offer help with towels and setting up your lounge chairs  Likely a combination of culture and local economics  the service in Dubai is clearly in a different league than say Hawaii  It was highly impressive how kind everyone was We managed to eat in every restaurant over the course of the week  The two  fancy  restaurants are Manhattan Grill  a steakhouse  and the Lebanese restaurant Awtar  Both meals were very good  though I would not call either outstanding  At Manhattan Grill I had a Nebraska corn fed filet on the bone  Maggie had lamb  in each case preceded by a Caesar  We ordered a variety of small sides  Everything was correctly prepared  and tasty  but did not blow us away  The service was good  and although our server did not know much about the wines by the glass  he sent over the sommelier who was quite knowledgeable  At Awtar  we had a variety of small dishes as is typical with a Lebanese meal  and a huge plate of a variety of grilled meats including several types of interestingly marinated lamb  They brought a huge tower of uncooked vegetable to much on for free  The fresh pressed juices were delicious My favorite restaurants were the ones lower in formality  The Italian restaurant Andiamo offered perhaps the best cuisine of our stay  A taglioline with fresh scallops and a light cream sauce was to die for  King prawns were grilled to perfection  The salads were crisp and fresh  and the wine pairings offered were spot on  Peppercrab was also outstanding  Though not strictly Singaporean  the curried jumbo prawns were out of this world  as was some of the other seafood  Again here  nice job recommending wines  That leaves Wox  an inexpensive Asian fusion place where we enjoyed our very affordable meal and Sushi  a well you get it  The fish was fresh  amp  good This is a beautiful hotel  as other have mentioned  an  urban resort   You can pretty much forget you are in the middle of a city when you are down here  It is a ton of acres  although there are roads around you do not hear traffic from the rooms or grounds  and you do not see traffic from the grounds although from upper rooms you can look out and realize you are in the city  Nor is this hotel in really the  downtown  part of the city  even though it is an urban resort the density around the hotel is pretty low The grounds are immaculately manicured  There is a nice jogging trail around the perimeter of the grounds and you will find ample lawns  gardens  tennis courts and of course a huge pool area with hundreds of chaises and multiple cabanas  no extra charge   Full resort style pool service  with alcohol available from noon and food all day  The pools don t have a ton of fantasy water features  think the Maui waterfall  etc    however  there is a nice  island  in the middle of the main pool with a couple chaises and some palm tress  There is a giant kids pool with a climb aboard play structure and two waterslides for the kiddies  there is also a cabana covered infant pool which looks like its own mini beach  In short  there is enough pool area  by size  to keep things very interesting for everyone A particular highlight  as mentioned above  is the spa  Very tranquil  and very clean  Maggie had two treatments   a    minute massage and a facial  the total for both with tip about US      So quite a reasonable deal compared to Western resorts  She said the service was great  There is a large gym and a couple of squash court  Just for hanging out  I really enjoyed the spa as the lap pool  which features underwater speakers with light jazz   sauna and steam rooms and showers are all very nice  very relaxing  A nice quiet place to go in the morning or evening or any time in between to relax In summary  really nice stay at a really nice place  A place to easily relax for a week or even longer and explore surrounding Dubai  You can be somewhat in the middle of things in terms of day trips and sights  and also close to the airport  while simultaneously loosing yourself in a huge mega resort with plenty of resort amenities  The great food  abundant facilities and endless kindness of the staff were the icing on the cake   a great stay  
Perfect in every way Just got back from four days at the Grand Hyatt in Dubai   we chose this hotel based on excellent reviews on Trip Adviser  We were definately not disappointed   it was wonderful  The hotel is VERY impressive as you walk in  with a very large and grand marble clad lobby area  There are about    restaurants   we ate in four and all were very good  I definately recommend the WOK chinese   excellent value and food  the italian was great but loads more expensive   We upgraded to a Creek View room on arrival  worked out a lot cheaper than booking this room in the first place    it was well worth it   a huge room with a fabulous view with floor to ceiling windows  The pool area is brilliant and the food served at the pool bar is really good  The staff are exceptional   very polite and helpful  always friendly I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel   if you are very fussy about where you stay and are sick of being disappointed then this hotel is for you  First class in EVERY respect  
P => What a disappointment    Our trip got off to a bad start  We booked a  night stay at the Al Habtoor as a special birthday treat Arriving at Dubai airport at   in the morning we were met by a smiley happy person telling us the Hotel was overbooked   and we were being transferred to their sister Hotel in the City     Not impressed    Just one night he said   gleefully  Needless to say we were offered the mandatory upgrade and     off  but losing a morning by the sea is penal when you are on a short stay  The car to transfer us was late and we almost lost the whole of the next morning  Suitably apologetic the Hotel Room Manager upgraded us to a Suite  They were attentive  cant complain but felt they should have wiped out the first night room caost completely  However  we got the free birthday cake and one or two other little things  but our main impression of the resort and Dubai was poorWith an overcrowded main pool  poor signposting everywhere  lots of lack of attention to detail we could see no justification for the   star rating  In Spain it would have been a   star plus The breakfast areas suffered from a lack of attention to the fine details  Cutlery missing  having to hail down waiters for tea or coffee  a    minute wait for poached eggs  then switching to bouiled eggs  no egg cups   And you dont want to spend your holiday surrounded by high rise construction everywhere I think Dubai Tourist or Government Agencies have lost the plot  There is no compensation for lack of culture  far too much soulless building  overcrowded highways  beaches that would compete poorly with the med   and sky high prices in the Hotels  The atmosphere is of a society which is shallow and driven by profit and greed  and the victims are tourists  Take away the sun and whats left   In summary this holiday reminded of my early holidays in Benodorm Dubai  and Al Habtoor in particular  wake up    Or we wont be coming back 
P => Beautiful Hotel I read some of the other reviews and tend to agree with some of the content  The hotel surroundings are not pretty  there is construction going on all over Dubai  Get a tower room  as they are newer and just gorgeous   Fresh fruit and chocolates greet you  The hotel restaurants are fantastic  The buffet breakfast is never ending and the Mediterranean Middle East restaurant off the lobby is wonderful  Go early   the restaurant doesn t even open until   p m  We were the only customers there and got treated like royalty   The lounge next door is a nice place for a quiet drink and the British pub downstairs is a great place to meet friends  The Emirates Mall   Forget it  Go to the Ibn Buttata mall  It s quieter  mush nicer inside  each section is a different country e g  China  India  and the stores are the same or better  
P =>  toddlers delight We stayed with our two kids      amp    Years  We booked a club room and when we checked in we asked for a upgrade to suite  which we got but they took away the club option  After a couple of days and change of staff the club was gving back and a better suite as well  We were staying for   weeks after all  The club was brillant the two guys there dealt with my crazy kids brillantly  They made us feel like royalty and it was certainly the best thing about the hotel  We arranged babysitters  but it is important that you try and arrange it early and have confirmation as there is a huge communication problem within departments in the hotel  There is a lot of disgruntled employees  but you meet them in every hotel in dubai  We opted to have breakfast in the room most mornings as it was easier with the children  but one morning we got some unwelcomed guests in our cereal  museli   it was the only time that the service was so quick and the food and beverage manager turned up that evening with some canapes as an apology  The underground bar is very friendly and happy hour is good value  The pool is brillant and was such a beautiful temp the jazcuzzis on the steps are great welcome into the pool  And the kiddies pool is exciting for the younger ones  We stayed at the oasis beach the week before and it was freezing in the kiddies pool  The kids club is newly opened and not fully functional  my daughter was the only one in there most of the time so got the attention of three people  they were excellent  The rooms are all new  finishes is pretty bad you can see it was a rushed job at the end  but the fittings are   star  beds great  The Spa and gym are excellent  And the pool  amp  beach guards fantastic  Food was a bit dull for room service and the beach front cafe was rotten  But the Mexican restaurant excellent  Overall  it has the makings of a state of the art hotel  no expensive has been spared   its just the service in certain areas of the hotel that needs ajusting  But for   hundred euros a night you should expect the best  
P =>  Great stay at Habtoor Grand Resort As my friends and I left the Habtoor Grand Resort we saw the    rating at the entrance  The property is nearly there at      in my opinion  We stayed four days in two closeby resort rooms overlooking the huge pool area  Attendants were plentiful and keen to assist  Several restaurant staff offered to take drinks and snacks orders for guests  Small problems in the rooms were quickly fixed by polite staff  Everywhere was spotless and housekeeping staff were seen tidying and polishing  The eating choices are extensive but a little pricey  Deals are available during happy hour for selected beverages in the Underground sports bar  The only shop is pool side for amenities and has a limited range  A local supermarket at Dubai ina is a    min taxi ride  AED    or a dusty    min walk  Most of the surrounding area is under construction with some noise and traffic  The clientele were from varied backgrounds including Europe  Russia and China  We all had outstanding experiences using the Elixir spa facilities at reasonable prices   but you need to book a day ahead  The state of the art gym is well worth a visit and its open      Our initial thought was that our rate was expensive but reviewing the stay we all agreed it was very good value for the location and facilities The property did well to make it on to my own favourite places to stay  It s a great place for a relaxing holiday with or without children  Enjoy  
P =>   A resort surrounded by big construction sides with nice pool    The problem with many hotels in Dubai and that counts as well for the Habtoor is that it is not five star  It is between   and   in my eyes  Most of the reviews of Habtoor are correct  The shower often does not work properly  The rooms are o k  and very clean  The cuisine tries to be European but is not and it would be properly better to either change the cook or change the dining concept  The shops are not existing and the friendlyness of the staff is okay  but there is room for improvement  The pool area is nice and well maintained  The beach area is surrounded by many construction towers and is nothing special  This area as such is not nice at all and it looks like it has been the case on the Spanish coastside during the    s  Spoiling the country and the seaside for gigantic planing seems to be the motto big  bigger  the ugliest  The hotel is very far from the City Center and there is nothing around but construction sides  I would say  it is not worth the money you have to pay  I was there for business reasons  The hotel has many guests from Russia and AustraliaI have been to Dubai many times now and every time I come back  it more looses its identity  Shopping Malls like everywhere else in the world  European prices  European dishes  American Restaurants Chains      and the newer part of Dubai has no flair at all  Next time  I will prefer a Hotel in the older part of Dubai  
P =>  Go Habtoor  I stayed   nights and   days in Habtoor Grand Resort and Spa a fortnight back Like the rest of Dubai  its presence towers you  I stayed in the rooms near the pool  the old structures  Contrary to what I had heard previously  the room was quite nice with apt room service  The minibar was well stocked and the bathroom decent  The gym of habtoor is very large and the buffets delicious  The beach is a treat for an early morning walk The reception and conceirge desks  staff were fairly good but could do with improvement And yes  the valet service and doormen were courteous to the hilt The new spa treatment is quite relaxing if you have the time All in all  I would recommend it to anyone visiting Dubai for work or leisure  
P =>  what else could you want  I have just returned from a half term break at the Habtoor Grand  We could not get into the Jumeriah and the agent at  Best at  suggested this hotel I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews published on tripadvisor  Fortunately they did not appear particulary representative of this hotel and I felt the need to help correct the balance Situated between the Grosvenor the Royal Meridien and the yacht club  the Habtoor has its own well enclosed grounds that lead to its private beach The only building works affecing it are in the grounds of the Royal Meridien  Having only been open   months the hotel and grounds are in pristine condition  We had a family tower room which was spacious in the extreme  as was the bathroom  with one of the biggest walk in showers I have seen   There are older  garden rooms in the grounds that did appear relatively shabby from the outside  I was lead to understand there is a future plan for them to be demolished and two more towers built All the staff offered a friendly greeting all the time  The reception staff were helpful  although some of them appeared shy in asking if you needed help  I mentioned a problem about towels and having sorted the problem they remembered to keep asking if everything was still ok The sports facilities were excellent  The two tennis courts had only been open a   months  the professional was great value  The gym was huge with all new top of the range kit  about    weight stations and    aerobic machines   Two trainers were there all the time but there were never more than one or two other guests training The main buffet restaurant was superb with a different choice of dishes every night  We opted to eat in   of the other   restaurants  Our half board allowance was removed from the final bill  We had been warned about the price of wine so were not surprised by the price of an average bottle All the restaurants appeared very quiet in the evening  yet breakfast was very busy  The hotel was fully booked so I assume they have built in capacity for future development There was a real mixture of fellow guests  Families from all over Europe  delegates from various conferences running at the hotel and a constant turnover of Canadian Army personnel from Afganistan  who made the pool bar very lively  There appeared to be   sunbeds for every guestOur daughter enjoyed the kids club and waterslides We all enjoyed the watersports  especially the jetskis Overall I felt the hotel easily exceeded our expectations and would recommend to a family visiting Dubai  
P =>  Thought the hotel was great and I am a travel agent  I have just returned after my first visit to Dubai  I went on a work educational where we look at various hotels and excursions whilst out there  We were lucky to stay in the Habtoor Grand  On our coach journey from the airport we could see our hotel in the Jumeirah Skyline yet due to the building work going on its seemed to take ages actually pulling up to the hotel  It seemed to be that you go the long way round to get to the entrance yet in theory that was the only way to get to it The reception area is large and spacious and the service very efficient I couldn t fault that  The hotels guest rooms were located in   towers  Some people didn t realise this and went to the wrong tower Our room was lovely and spacious and compared to the other hotels we visited out there I realise that we were very lucky because of this  In your room there is a selection of fruit  cakes and chocolates for you to eat  Also something I noticed is they supplied the plates and knifes and forks in order to eat them  How often have I stayed at a hotel and struggled to find a plate etc without ordering room service The rooms all have a hairdryer in them  comlimentary slippers and bath robes you can use during your stay The bathroom was well equiped and amenity kits were good  They had complimentary raizor and shaving gel  cotton buds  body lotion  bath salts  shampoo conditioner amoung a few and also good size bottles so you are not fighting over them We had a fridge in our room yet we never purchased the items  Although outside on the side is a fresh bottle of still water which is complimentary Our room overlooked the reception and the smaller pool  I personally think that after  pm or so this pools sunlight may be blocked out from the   tower blocks I went to the main pool where they supply complimentary towels to use  There is plenty of sunbeds and tables in between them I got a leaflet on the spa prices and to tell you the truth i thought they were quite reasonable  Some treatments were about     Dirham some     Dirham it depends what you wanted  Unfortuately I did not have time to sample any yet I would have loved to The gym looked well equiped although I didn t use it There is a underground pub which is popular   It has a pool table and a nice area to socialize although i would say you are looking at    Dirhams for half a Tiger beer     Dirhams for a coke so I suppose they are about the same as other hotels restaurants in Dubai The hotel has a childrens club and a range of activities are put on a sheet in your hotel room  If I was to take my children they would feel occupied The breakfast is a buffet service  I am a fussy eater so this is normally a better option for me  There was a wide range of cheeses  fruits  cereals  cooked breakfasts  no Pork though  so they do like Turkey Bacon or steaks instead  Omlette bar  toast  pastries  youghurt etc  Food would not be a problem and I am sure they would cater for any special diet if you warned them  I feel if I could eat there and be stuffed each day then others would be fine aswell as I am very particular with what I eat I am a Dubai Expert and happy to offer any advise so please email me  
P =>  Excellent hotel I have just returned from this hotel yesterday after spending   nights in it  My room was on the   th floor with a view over the palm island and the marina  The room was large and the bathroom was really nice with a glass sink  very large shower which was powerful and a massive bath  The staff where very friendly  The breakfast that you get is fit for a king  I tried the underground British pub a few nights  this was very nice but go during happy hour from    pm or you end up paying a lot for drinks  There is a really big swimming pool with a swim up bar and a lap pool on the  rd floor  but I didn t have time to see it   The beach has lots of sunbeds with life guards on duty  Yes there is building work everywhere in Dubai and it can t be avoided  There are a lot of new apartment towers being built along the Jumeriah Beach area and there will be approx     to be completed around this area over the next few years  these will form the Dubai ina development  I had a wonderful time   rd time in Dubai   I don t think the building work will ever end in Dubai as at the moment it is only     of the rulers vision for the future  
P =>   Don t be mistaken    Being able to identify the value of a review  or lack of it   does relate to the experiences of the reviewer  Given how many problems arose staying here it may help if I mention that usually I d like to be staying somewhere like the Hotel du Vin chain in the UK or a good quality  friendly  comfortable and charming hotel   so that is probably why I did not like the Habtoor It is new   and therein lies most of the problem  It certainly does not compare to the Madinat or Jumeirah Beach in quality or location  The weather might be nice but behind the hotel it is remiscent of      s Spain with tower blocks obscuring the morning sun To make clear   this is not a   star hotel and do not expect that  I too found that the hotel reception staff were sullen  uninspired and difficult for the most part   although having complained about this I did get more response and was looked after  The garden view rooms are definitely not part of the new build so avoid   the two new main towers have nice rooms that are spacious  Unfortunately there are large numbers of teething problems  My shower did not work  It was  quot fixed quot  three times during my stay   once because it would not go hot  then because it would not change from boiling hot and then because the water was going up not down    On the last occasion I despaired as I came back and found the hallway covered in water  the workmen having left it like that The food was distinctly average  Western but not anything to inspire  Facilies were ok   gym was fine  pool ok in the early morning and reasonably large  The beach was nothing special  I was at a conference held at the Madinat but could not get a room there  It is better located   with a souk right beside it  Dubai is a strange mix of cultures  I went to the huge Mall of the Emirates  a combination of all things English and American  Shop at Next  John Lewis  or its equivalent    and buy coffee at Starbucks whilst watching people ski in the ski dome  Bizarre   and the prices are no different to shopping at home  Would I go back to Dubai  If I had a business reason to do so but not socially  Would I go back to this hotel  Definitely not  Despite the teething problems there were too many underlying issues to suggest that it will ever be of the quality and nature of a five star hotel  when compared to similar places both in Dubai and worldwide   Any suggestion that it is of that quality is I believe misleading  
P => ab fab Hi Stayed at the Habtoor over Christmas  Having seen the really bad reviews was worried but trust me its a great place  The staff  rooms and overall experience was very good  We stayed in garden view rooms overlooking the pool very nice and quiet  The trip was booked through trailfinders and they were excellent  Restaurants were quiet in the hotel but the food we did have was very very good  There is a lot of construction work around the hotel but this did not interfere with our holiday  
P =>   Stay home if you have booked here  On the surface this hotel appears to be pretty nice  possibly of four star quality   but things quickly change after spending time within its walls  We have been staying at the hotel for almost   weeks  with a week to go  and have been miserable  The physical appearance of the hotel creates a certain expectation level for service that this hotel just can t meet at this time  The staff is trying hard  but as other reviewers have said they have a hard time communicating in English  and it takes at least two phone calls to get anything done  We haven t had to change rooms   until today when our water disappeared and the whole floor we were on is under construction  They had asked if they could move because of some  quot routine maintenance quot   Because we had been there for a few weeks and are currently working  so no time to move  we asked if they could keep us where we are and hold off on the  quot routine maintenance quot   Our mistake  I accept part of the blame  but it outlines the difficulty in communication that is rampant at this hotel  Had I known they were going to be stripping walls and pulling off moulding  I would have moved  I think that s a little more extensive than  quot routine maintenance quot   Am I wrong That is just one example of the situation here  I don t think I need to talk about others  They are all covered by the other reviewers  The only thing that I like about the hotel is the valet crew and doormen  They are great  helpful and always smiling  They all deserve raises Just remember if you have booked here and are still planning on staying after reading these comments  It looks pretty good  but expect one star service and a lot of frustration  
P =>   We never would stay here again  I m here at the Habtoor  quot Grand quot  Resort  amp  Spa right now with   employees    rooms total for    days  We re staying here for business  We re very seasoned travellers  and not whiners This place is horrible  Someday it may be OK   but is should not be open now  One of the bellmen told one of us that about     of the rooms were not yet  quot habitable quot   Well  let me tell you that at least several that are being sold are not habitable either  I ll not bore you with the low quality fit and finish throughout  Oh  and the windows are filthy By the way last year we stayed at the Madinat Jumairah a few miles up the beach  sold out this time   THAT is a   star hotel  Habtoor calling itself  quot   star   quot  is a horrible lie  Real problems center on water   particularly showers  All hot  no cold   or all cold  no hot   or tile floor leveled wrong so the water totally floods the room  How about A C   your choice  none  or   C with no control  Some outlets work   some don t  Maintanance says they can t repair these things without tearing walls apart   so we get moved  Our champion  so far  is in his  th room  no upgrades by the way  just another room     are on their  th    on his  th  well  you get the idea  A side note  perhaps they actually are repairing things  a number of times various members of my party are avakened at   or   AM by extensive banging on pipes The main resturant is OK for breakfast  I d not eat there again for lunch or dinner  Even for buffets  the staff can barely understand english so wrong drinks and checks are routine  Returning late evenings I ordered dessert there   times  So far I ve got   entirely different items  one was way off the chart  and the other   were recognisable as what I ordered  yet vastly dissimilar  I guess they make it up as they go along  We ve taken to eating at the Hard Rock which is fairly close  it might even be walkable if the hotel wasn t surrounded by massive high rise construction projects  One morning there was entertainment as a man on a rickety ladder caulked all the windows in the dining room  Yesterday morning there was a man applyig a smelly sealant inside our elevator  merrily burping every few minuites as we decended the    floors  A desk clerk suggested I get an item at the gift shop   after following signs for a while another staffer explained there is no gift shop yet  but they hope to have one soon  Our experienceis that staff is not nasty  just very ignorant of correct procedures and or unable to communicate in English Oh  and connecting to the internet is     Dh per day  wireless or cable  which I consider near robbery   its free at Hard Rock Again  Never Again

P =>  Hallmark hotel Excellent hotel  Has great facilities  recommended  
P =>   Good time at the Hallmark Havejust come back home after having a   day break in Dubai  stayed at the Hallmark Hotel in deira  The hotel was great  The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful and most importantly  courtious at all times  Myself and my travel companion felt safe and well looked after during our stay  The standart twin room we occupied was spacious and was very clean and well equipped with kettle and cups so that we could make a drink when we wanted  The bathroom was very clean indeed and well stocked with complimentary toiletries etc if you have forgotten to bring your toothbrush Dubai is not so hot this time of year  only about    degrees centigrade  so it was so much pleasant to walk around the city  Air conditioning was available in the hotel room and in public areas of the hotel as well  The hotel is located just off Al Rigga Road  the main food street in Deira  You can eat any type of cuisine you desire  though be prepared for the prices as Dubai is not cheap  There is a shopping mall located less than   minutes from the hotel which for me  was excellent  Dubai creek and the Jumera beach side of Dubai is a small bus or taxi journey away  The hotel is ideally located for most attractions  If you get the chance  try the Big Bus company open top bus tour of Dubai  We pre booked this trip on expedia at the time we booked our hotel and flights and got a good discount dong it this way  We got on the bus at the Deira City Centre Mall  It stops at all the main tourist attractions and you can hop on or off at any time  
P =>   Poor Service   Mediocre and Expensive I stayed at this hotel for   nights in      The service was terrible  and unfriendly  Rooms were barely adequate for the prices charged  over USD      location just average  but what beat everything is the poor attitude of hotel staff  Suspicious of guests  inefficient  and unfriendly  Not a good value for money proposition  
P =>  The winner takes it all k A bit sceptical having read reviews  but didn t see any of the negatives mentioned  Having arrived at  am they allowed an early check in  Personally felt it was a great location to see the best bits of Dubai  nothing more than a cheap taxi ride away  This is not a hotel for anyone wanting a beach holiday in Dubai  but for anyone wanting to see the original Dubai on a short break  it s great  Not too far to Deira City for the start of the Big Bus Tour  close to the Creek for a Dhow cruise or Abra ride to Bur Dubai  Recommend the China Club Restaurant at the Raddisson close by  Didn t use many of the hotel facilities  except for the rooftop pool which is a great place to relax  The rooms were comfortably furnished  Only gripe is that the   bottles of drinking water provided on the first day was not replaced by the Chamber Maid  so suggest buying your own supply as the tap water is not drinkable  Recommended to any young people wanting a reasonably priced base to explore Dubai  Finally our request for a late check out was granted without any fuss  and they provided a free taxi to the airport  
P =>   great experience at the Hallmark After staying in Bur Dubai for   weeks in a nice but expensive hotel apartment  my family and I wanted to experience Dubai from Deira  We booked our stay at the Hallmark after reading the  then  one review on TripAdvisor  While the ongoing renovations meant the lobby was under various stages of construction  we enjoyed our stay at the Hallmark and loved the location within one block to Al Ghurair City Shopping Centre and with a free shuttle bus to Deira City Centre  With an infant  we appreciated that while the hotel was   star  it did not serve alcohol and thus we did not have a nightclub  or several  and the accompanying noise to contend with  There is construction everywhere in Dubai so any surrounding noises were expected and no problem  The buffet breakfast  while sometimes a bit crowded  this was alleviated when the hotel opened an adjacent room to accommodate everyone   was so delicious   particularly the local offerings   moutabal  hummus  feta  etc  Our favorite aspect  as Americans  were the many Iranian guests we met at the Hallmark during our stay  All  without exception  were warmly welcoming to the region and made our stay at the Hallmark extra special  as did the lovely Ethiopian woman who works in the lobby cafe   There is a pool and fitness area on the top floor although we did not use these as it was so hot in ust   I imagine it would be nice at other times of year  There is also an excellent and cheap juice shwarma place around the corner   Infinity com I think  Very refreshing watermelon juice  Given how expensive Dubai is  our room rate        USD per night  made the Hallmark an excellent and recommended value  We later stayed at a horrible place on Jumeirah Beach  and wished we were back at the Hallmark  
P => 	out of    having read previous reviews very dubious about our forthcoming stay however need not have been  the refurb is complete rooms great location good but best of all the helpfulness of the staff  they were all very friendly escpecially the bellboys  we had a brill time  
P =>  Top marks to the Hallmark Date   th il     We have just returned from a week at the Hallmark Hotel in Dubai  which greatly exceeded our expectations  When  Value Added Travel  recommended the hotel to us I was concerned that I couldn t find it in any of the Travel books  nor had it been rated on the Trip advisor website  which I always consult in advance of making a holiday booking   Value Added  said that the facilities couldn t be bettered at the price  so we decided to take a risk  Eventually I found a mention of the Hallmark in the      Footsteps guide  and then realised that it was probably too new to have made the other editionsThe hotel is family run and couldn t have done more to make our holiday the success that it was  They arranged complementary airport transfers both ways all the staff were helpful and friendly  Reception provided good advice on trips and things to do etc The Hallmark is about   minutes drive from the Airport in downtown Deira  but being positioned in between Al Rigga Road and Al Maktoum Road   it is remarkably free from traffic noise and as no alcohol is served on the premesis there was no bar to disturb us either  We only saw  heard planes when using the rooftop swimming pool and sunbathing area As the Hallmark is only   years old  it is still in pristine condition  Standard Rooms are a good size   fitting in an extra bed for our   year old daughter was no problem   with all the usual    facilities  There are Monet prints on the walls and lovely deep baths in the ensuite We were concerned that staying in a city centre location could be a disadvantage  especially as our daughter loves the beach  but this is compensated for by the daily morning shuttle to and from the Jumeriah Beach Park  nominal   Dhrs entrance per person  about    minutes drive away  There s also a free shuttle to a nearby Shopping Mall at  pm daily  return at  pm Food at the hotel was good  There s an excellent complementary Buffet Breakfast and the Coffee shop is open all day until well into the evening  serving a good range of snacks  pasta pizzas etc  The Restaurant serves a really good Buffet at lunchtime  prices both there and in the Coffee Shop are reasonable and well below what one would pay for similar fare in EnglandAlthough the Rooftop pool is on the small side it is an ideal spot to relax and sunbathe  Towels are provided and there are a good supply of chairs and umbrellasSo top marks to the Hallmark  and also to Value Added Travel  for having such good local knowledge and recommending the hotel to us  We found this Agent by chance on the Internet and would certainly book through them again for Midddle East trips  
P => 
P => Beautiful resort but not much to do in town I stayed one night  The place is nice for a weekend getaway from Dubai  but there isn t much to do in town  The rooms are clean and well equipped  Some of the resort amenities such as the rock pool were unfortunately closed  The negatives are poor in room lighting and lack of WiFi  There is a broadband Internet connection in the room but the cost is exorbitant  The staff is friendly  There is a small gym  
P =>   Hatta Fort Excellent setting  service is friendly and basically flawless  This is rated as a four star but provides a   star service with excellent facilities and F amp B Hatta Fort has outlasted many of the other hotels in Dubai and still retains its charm This is also an excellent base to explore the area   the Omani border is some    mins away 
P =>  As exceptional as always    Have been visiting the Hatta Fort Hotel for fifteen years and this year  as ever  we were deeply impressed by the excellent service  warmth and efficiency of all the staff  The rooms are clean  well equipped and beautifully located  My only quibbles would be that the in room lighting has always been dreadful and only seems to get worse and although there is broadband internet in the rooms the cost is extortionate The restaurants are well run and the food excellent  Quite why it says on its website it is a Four Star Hotel I can t think   it has all the qualities to make it one of the best Five Stars in the Gulf  They could improve the booking system  It took a number of days to confirm the booking since if you don t use the internet to book they request a fax or email of credit card details  refusing to take them over the phone  Obviously emailing is not an option due to the security risk so it only leaves faxing   not always easy in this day and age  Speaking to two different gentlemen on the telephone was confusing since one confirmed receipt of the fax and later the other denied all record of a reservation  Otherwise check in was fast  efficient and welcoming  I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody wanting a couple of days peace and tranquility since on the whole it is exceptional  
P =>   If you have the chance stay here For a short escape of the hectic Dubai life  go to the Hatta Fort Hotel for a weekend  The staff is very welcoming  free fruit cocktail  and helpful  There are two pools  one for families and one adult pool  The rooms are in chalet style  but very clean and a gorgeous bathroom   including candles We had dinner in the restaurant and ordered a ceasar salad for two  The mayonaisse for the salad and the salad itselves was prepared in front of ourselves The waiter only pourred too much oil in the mayonaisse and decided to start all over with fresh ingredients    I ve never seen two people working soo hard on a salad  it s highly recommended   The wine selection is also excellent and is served at exactly the right temperature Arround Hatta  there is not that much to see  Of course there are the Hatta Pools  but it s unfortunately full of garbage and grafitti  
P =>   Gorgeous chalet style rooms attentive staff nice mountain views My husband  amp  I stayed at the Hatta Fort Hotel on Friday night  taking advantage of the lowish price  DBB was      dhs including tax   We were warmly welcomed on arrival and given some juice  Unfortunately we weren t able to get into our rooms till  pm  they don t seem to be flexible re that  so we went to the Gazebo restaurant for lunch  The quality of the food was mediocre at best  When we got into our room we were much happier  The rooms are truly lovely    nice dark furniture  a comfy bed  lovely accessories  nice  clean and spacious bathroom  with The White Company toilettries   and each chalet has a balcony  nice views from the balcony     you should note that the hotel is nestled at the foot of the mountains    not up in the mountains   It really was a   star room  Later on in the day when it got a bit cooler  we played crazy golf and had a little walk around the grounds  lovely view of the mountains   In the winter months it would be nice to take advantage of the tennis courts  and there is also archery and clay pigeon shooting on offer amongst other things  There is also a pool which my husband ventured into  but it really was too hot for me  At night we had our   course dinner in the main restaurant  Jeema I think it was called   The service was friendly but not as efficient as I would have liked  The food was fine    my husband s steak was really tasty actually   but nothing special  I think I expected too much   I must say that the wine list was very comprehensive and the price for house wine very reasonable  However  the breakfast in the morning was much better  There was a wide range of foods   cereals  cheese  cold meats  fresh fruit  rolls and pastries etc  and there was hot food outside selling pork items  the sausages and bacon were very good   The chef made up an omelette for my husband on the spot and it was really delicious  I really enjoyed our stay at the Hatta Fort   it s just a shame it was too hot for us to indulge in some of the more sporty pursuits that were on offer  In general the staff were good  especially one guy called Laxman   and I really loved the room  I was wondering why it was only a   star as the rooms are great and there are lotsof facilities     maybe it s the quality of the restaurants and bars  which we never tried   PS  We went to the Heritage Village in Hatta    we didn t think it was anything special  We climbed up to the tower though and got some good snaps  We also drove up to the dam which afforded an opportunity for good photos  There isn t much else to recommend Hatta itself  Oh  there is a Co Op just infront of the entrance to the hotel which is handy if you ve forgotten anything  
P =>  And now for something entirely different     Only a one night stay  unfortunately  but we managed to fit in a lot  We arrived mid afternoon on    y       The duty porter is a real character  with a lot of humorous chat  and very efficient  including valet parking  Check in was quick and with a minimum of fuss Our one bedroom suite was excellent  and there were only minor issues  such as a rather complex light switch arrangement and no hair conditioner amongst the complimentary toiletries We took a stroll around the extensive landscaped grounds  followed by a swim in the pool immediately adjacent to the main buildings  The second pool was temporarily closed for maintenance We had dinner in  Jeema   the evening   la carte restaurant  The service was good  the food very good  although we both felt that the sauce prepared for our Steak Dianne was rather too powerful  Breakfast and lunch in the casual dining  Caf  Gazebo  were both good  In between eating  we took a three hour guided  x  tour to Hatta Pools  Excellent value  and a very refreshing and cooling swim whilst there  But   be warned  if you do go for a swim then you will need to walk barefoot on hot and sharp stones   plastic or rubber  flip flops  are absolutely recommended   we were surprised that the hotel did not suggest this   or  indeed  sell these in their shop Departure was quick and straightforward  and was orchestrated by the comedian porter Before leaving Hatta  we took a    minute look at the Traditional Village  No information in English is immediately available  but if one starts poking around and opening a few doors then there is a good amount of explanatory signage  
P =>   Very much improved retreat This Hotel is an old favourite of mine and is a welcome getaway from the frantic bustle and trendiness of Metro Dubai  It s only an hours drive from the city and whilst the town of Hatta  nestling in the Hajar Mountains  has developed incredibly over the last five years  the Hotel and its  quot chalet quot  type rooms  still occupies a quiet corner of the town  even if the view now includes the local Co Op store I have stayed here several times over the years but this time everything had been renovated and the huge  timbered ceiling rooms are now fully up to   star hotel standard  All amenities are available in the room  which was spotless and serviced twice a day  My only problem was a lack of hot water but because the cold water in the roof tank was so hot anyway  the outside temperature was    degreesC  this was not a problem  Air conditioning is excellent and the Internet link in the room is efficient  even at a price of US    per day The coffee shop style restaurant and bar is only open during the day  closes at     pm  but serves great snack food  and cold beer    during this time  In the evening the main restaurant in the central hotel building opens and here the food  both Table d Hote and A La Carte is really excellent  although the wine list could do with a bit of a shake up  Eddie runs this restaurant  and has done for years  and he certainly knows his stuff The pool is large and clean and well serviced by pool staff  There are lots of activities   if that s what you want   shooting  archery  rambles etc and a small gym although my suggestion is that you would go there just to chill out for a while  rather than run around frantically doing things Ther is a spa which could also do with a bit of upgrading  Staff are super friendly and service is really excellent   it was a great improvement on my last stay and everybody made us feel like the valued us as customers  This place is really worth a visit   don t miss it  
P =>   Restful  hot and dry I ll not parrot the others  comments  which I agree with  This place is apparently run by the same folks as the Jebel Ali Golf Resort  We got a deal for room bkfst in Suite         this weekend  a bedroom sitting room combo that used to be   separate bedrooms  Nicely appointed  esp the bathrooms  Fluffy robes and slippers  big towels  votive candles  fruit basket     AED for bottles of Aussie red wine  well stocked minibar  blackout curtains  Main restaurant is a throwback to the   s  with flambe everything and lots of domed covers  but steaks were good  the rest of the dinner was unremarkable  Staff is very well trained  one told us the waiters had to graduate from the Indian hospitality schools in order to get a job there  Wine list was decent  and service was skilled  unlike some places in Dubai  Very good value for money  even if the car sensor did hit    degrees C on the way there  That s    F  But unlike Dubai  the air was clear and very dry  you can sit out by the pool all but      when it really gets too darn hot and the wind picks up  Don t bother with golf in anything but winter  hubby declared the golf  quot green quot  a dirt pitch  Very basic gym  nice pool area well attended to  with towels and drink service  Surprising amount of bird life and still a few blooms around  It makes a very nice quiet and non humid change from the city  and the mountains are beautiful  We ll go again    
P =>   A different side of Dubai We stayed here for   nights a couple of weeks ago and loved it  it was nice to have a relaxing few days away from Dubai and see a different side of the Emirate  It s in a lovely spot in the mountains  the rooms and bathrooms are nice and big and very clean  and the balconys have lovely views across the resort to the mountains  The staff couldn t do enough for us and service was excellent  We managed to get a great deal in the off season with half board included and the food was excellent  I used the spa to have a manicure and I thought it was great value for a hotel spa at   AED  We travelled to the resort by public bus which goes from Al Sabkha Bus Station and also Gold Souk Bus station in Dubai  There is a bus stop almost at the bottom of the hotel s driveway  The bus cost  AED each which we thought was a much better option than paying    AED each way to get there by taxi or    AED by hotel transfer which appear to be the only other transport options  The bus does take longer   hrs     and they run on  quot Dubai time quot  ie  they turn up when they turn up  the bus from Dubai was almost an hour late leaving and about half an hour late coming back  but once they get going they are perfectly fine  They are modern air conditioned buses and there is space at the front where couples are able to sit together  Single men have to sit at the back  Would highly recommend a trip to Hatta and a stay at Hatta Fort Hotel  
P =>   Get away from it all After a couple of days on the beach we headed up for a few nights at Hatta  It is a nice place   about an hour and a half from Dubai Airport and easy to get to   We were there after the weekend   apparently it was busy then but during the week it is very quiet   In the afternoon you may have the pool to yourself   The service is very good   the rooms are large and well laid out  Try to avoid the far left end of the chalets  As you look a the front of the Hotel   as there is a building possibly to do with the laundry that has a substantial aircon   extractoer fan that runs        Takes the edge off of your evening G n T on the terrace   This hotel can s get a little overrun occasionally with daytime visitors   corporate events and groups of  x  s   The food is nice but beware the wine is very expensive   If I had a criticism it was the cocktails    ordered by the pool and on another occasion as pre dinner drinks    Rather poorly made and uninspired  Overall a great place to visit to get away from it all   Rock Pools are withing easy reach   One bit of advice it you plan to travel and further than Hatta take a map and a compass as Road signs are still at the planning stage and according to Police we spoke to are not due any day soon   
P =>  breathtaking scenery of Hajar Mountains An hour s drive from Dubai and a    minute drive from Oman Border  It s patios are overlooking the breathtaking scenery of Hajar Mountains For Dining  amp  Entertainment  Jeema Restaurant  Gazebo Coffee Shop  Al Falaj Private Dining Room and Roumol Cocktail Bar are available  Other highlights are  WD Safari  Golf Course  Temperature Controlled Swimming Pools and The Senses Beauty Salon Nearby Points of Interest are Hatta Pools  Natural water pools      km and Hatta Heritage VIllage  Museum      km  
P =>   Away from the City An excellent get away resort in the UAE  It s about       hr drive from Dubai  A nice property sprawled across the hills  Lots of recreational facilities are available  We liked the Clay pigeon shooting event  You can also shoot arrows or joing some other activities  When exhausted we had exquisite arabic food  The cottages are cool and each one had a nice balcony and garden views  Ample car parking space is available 
P =>  We have spent   chistmases here the staff are wonderful we have no adverse comme We have stayed here about nine times serveral visits at Christmas The food is excellent and staff extremely helpful and attentive without being overbearing A visit to Hatta Fort Hotel can be summed up as a delightfull experience We shall return again and again Ian and y Burnie  CYPRUS  
P =>   Nice birthday treat  I was taken to the Hatta Fort Hotel for a birthday treat  Staff were excellent  very smiley  helpful  looking like they loved their jobs    they gave a similar standard of service to that experienced in    London Swiss hotels  Rooms were nice  with good bathrooms  Big walk in showers and baths  Cocktail bar was very good  it has lots of red leather seats  and feels quite gentlemens club like  We dined in the restaurant   very good food  again served very nicely  Room service breakfast was excellent  and they had pork bacon sausages  All in all a very nice hotel  
P =>   Relax in the desert We first stayed at this hotel some    years ago  We returned briefly   years ago and this year used it as a   day break in our journey from Abu Dhabi to Fujairah  The staff  many have been there for over    years afford their guests every courtesy and level of service that is possible  Over the years it has grown and now extends to some    plus villa s all standing in their own space looking towards the distant mountains  The hotel offers in addition to fine dining  various other activities  Tennis  spa treatments  x  excusions through the desert and mountains  shooting  archery etc  In fact there is something for eveyone  We chose to be lazy  lounge at the pool  enjoy the excellent waiter service providing poolside drinks and snacks and wander around the towns visitor attractions  Children have their own pool and play areas full of interesting games and attractions designed to keep them both quiet and happy  The scenery is stunning  the food truly excellent and the staff some of the finest to be found anywhere  Highly recommend a visit  it will not disappoint  
P =>  A great getway An amazing getaway experience  Away from the hustle and bustle of the city of Dubai is an oasis of tranquillity Great service  extremely friendly staff and an amazingly spacious and opulently decorated rooms A really great place to relax and unwind 
P =>   A fantastic stay We stayed at the Hatta Fort Hotel for a long weekend  and were really pleased that we had chosen it  The rooms were fabulous and spotless  had lovely toiletries and amenities and a nice outlook over Hatta The pools were good  although not overly exciting  but poolside service was excellent  Nice games room with table tennis  air hockey and pool  as well as free mini golf  There was a small charge to use the driving range  I think   Dhs  and archery was something like DHS    a half hour lesson  There was also a well equipped gym The staff were fantastic and really helpful and cheerful at all levels  The buffet dinner at the reataurant was fantastic  so they have obviously upped their game since the poor reviews on this site were written  The breakfast buffet was also great  with wonderful pork sausages  a rarity at any buffet  even outside the Middle East As we were there in the middle of summer it was extremely hot  and as the hotel rooms are a short walk outdoors from the main building and restaurants with a few steps and small hills to cross  I wouldn t recommend that elderly or pregnant people book in during the hot summer months  You d have no worries during the cooler months  however Also be aware there s a dress code in the restaurant  where men must wear trousers and closed toe shoes  My husband  along with a few other blokes  were asked very politely to go back to their rooms to change I would definitely go back there in future  
P =>  Relaxing Stay Away From Busy Dubai My husband and I have just spent   nights at the hotel and had a wonderful time  We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and could not have chosen a better place  The service was exceptional  the decor amazing  and the food delicious  We found the atmosphere relaxing  aspecially the  quot quiet area quot  around the residents pool  It is only about one and a half hours from Dubai  a quick break from the city and into the country side It is worth a day trip as well  Thank you to all the staff that made it a memorable occassion  
P =>  Bad staff and customet service  Hotel located on the boarder of Oman  Beautifully designed rooms and various fascinating sites to see  Very bad customer service especially at the reception  Rude staff    
P => A great stopover on the way to Oman Hatta is conveniently located about   km before the border to Oman  Hatta Fort Hotel is a good choice for a stopover   rooms are spacious and well kept  the hotel grounds and the pool are very nice  The restaurant was amazingly good considering the location and the service was always smiling and helpful  Taking a side trip to one of the wadis is amazing and there are lots of other things to do in the area if you plan to stay longer  Recommended  
P =>   What a fantastic place What a fantastic place to stay  We spent the last   days of our holiday here and wished we d booked for the whole    days  The room we had was amazing and absolutely spotless  They provided a fruit basket for us on arrival and chocolates every night  The grounds were beautifully kept and the pool was clean and well looked after The staff were unfailingly courteous  helpful  friendly and were still smiling even after a    hour shift  Nothing was too much trouble for them We were on an  quot all inclusive quot  package and couldn t fault the food or the service  Friday was busy with people coming for breakfast and lunch but the standard of food and service didn t falter Although we ve just returned home we are already contemplating going back and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a peaceful location with lovely scenery and excellent services and facilities  
P =>   Great weekend getaway  What a lovely place to spend a weekend  We live in Dubai and are always looking for some place to get away from it all  especialy during the hot summer months  We had mixed reviews from friends who have been there but our experience was extremely positive  The atmosphere is cosy and friendly  The service is excellent  We stayed in a deluxe room and it was huge and very comfortable  It s perfect for couples  but we also noticed alot of families  The food was very nice and the property offers quite a few activities if you want to keep yourself entertained  
P =>  a wonderful retreat We have just returned from this lovely hotel in the desert about an hour from Dubai  We stayed in one of the newly decorated luxury rooms which was very nicely done in an Arabian style and worth the small amount of extra money  The staff were very friendly and helpful nothing being too much trouble  The food was excellent and the Valentine s dinner superb  There are   pools  one quiet one and one for children and as we were travelling alone we found this a bonus to be able to get away from lots of children  There are plenty of activities if you want them  such as archery  clay pigeon shooting  golfing  mini golf  tennis and hiring bikes  also jogging and walking trails  After   blissful days we really did nt want to leave and will definitely be returning in the not too distant future  The only tip I would offer is try to avoid Thursday evenings and Fridays as this is the weekend in the UAE and it did get very busy especially in the dining room on Thursday evening  
P => Good bad good bad which  I love Hatta Fort Hotel  The place is teeming with memories of great family vacations in Dubai  when my dad would decide to whisk the family away from the hustle and bustle of Dubai s rat race  I was    then    I am    now  The hotel is that old    and older    and it shows  But I love going back there for the lovely staff and service  those gorgeous Chalet styled rooms  you would think you were on a swiss mountain somewhere  whith the curtains drawn and minus the fireplace  and who can NOT be caught up in the magic of those beautiful wadi s  I completely recommend you drive there  Only an hour away from Dubai   the journey is not tireless and well worth it if you make a few fresh juice stops and possibly haggle over some lovely earthen pots that are for sale in endless numbers along the road side  Stop off at The Big Red for some quad biking adventure if you really want to arrive at this beautiful fort knackered  Regardless of what time you arrive  the staff are there  willing to please in every way  I just found it sad that a    yr old man was made to lug our luggage to our room  which was not exactly close  half a second in  my husband took over and the   of us had a nice little chat to the door   Once inside  the place was clean and spacious    think   adults and   kids fitting in without stepping on each other s toes  Yeah the rooms are quite big  We have always booked our say with a   course dinner included  Dhs     per night   And from a Relais  amp  Chateaux member restaurant you d expect nothing less    I must say I was a little disappointed on our last visit  Being fair  the head chef was on vacation  he s allowed   but you think the sous chef s working under him would have an inkling about cooking   nope  The straw that broke the camel s back was when my main course arrived and what was supposed to be some funky salsa turned out to be nothing but    HEINZ tomato ketchup  Man was I disappointed   especially after I had raved about this place to my friends and family  This was such a let down   I almost considered never going back there again  A little embarrassed by my outburst the next morning  as we were checking out   I let the hotel manager know what I thought of their crappy meal   I got an apology  Ce la vie  I would recommend this hotel and it s main restaurant to anyone   just make sure the head chef s not on vacation before you get your dinner cutlery ready  
P =>  Business Retreat We used Hatta Fort for a recent business meeting retreat  This is an excellent venue for getting your group to an out of the way location  Meeting factility is first quality for medium to small groups  Some people complain that it is very isolated    hour from Dubai  
P =>   Hot Hatta    Stayed here for   nights mid        We checked out the reviews on trip advisor before going and they were slightly mixed so we didn t really know what to expect  but basically went on a recommendation from a relative  The hotel does have a slightly older feel to it but is still very comfortable and clean  Its quite a small place but the staff cannot do enough for you  Infact the service really is the best thing about the hotel  the staff are simply superb and very friendly  We stayed in a refurbished room which was very large and extremely comfortable  with a luxury bathroom  If you can afford it  ask for a refurbished room  The two pools are excellent  the larger one being primarilly for childern and families  but the other smaller pool is closer to the main hotel and next to the caf  The food was excellent and very tasty  Infact the only negative thing I can say about the place  and only a minor thing  is the evening menu is a little limited  only about     choices  so after day   I was struggling to find something that really appealed  However  a fantastic buffet is laid on on Thursday and Friday evenings allowing you to try other things  Be aware also that there is very little outside the hotel grounds and the hotel is a good hours drive from Dubai city  All in all though  I d definably recommend the hotel to anyone   
P =>   Great hotel awful food  Looks like a      s country club  but has a lot of charm and character  The grounds are pleasant and green  despite the lack of rain for the last   years  which has put pay to their golf course   Lots of activities to do and nice pool areas The rooms are all outside chalets and the deluxe rooms are spacious  with lots of wood  nice soft furnishings  a sofa and large comfy bed   lots of character  Lighting is atmospheric  but very gloomy  All balconies have great views  Bathrooms are very good indeed  with shower and bath and are lit with candles at night Staff were very efficient and friendly and this was the only place in the UAE where we were shown to the room and everything explained Breakfast is very good with plenty of choice  but dinner is stuck in a      s time warp with Prawn Cocktail  Chicken Veronique and Black Forest Gateux all featuring   Its edible  but just naff and quite expensive naff too  The whole place is a series of contrasts and the bar is no exception   more like something from a bad porn movie  But when all is said and done   it is a really great place to stay and we did enjoy our time here  just accept you won t get haute cuisine  
P => Part of the family Could write their praises for hours as so many great experiences enlightened our stay here  Consistently friendly and helpful staff  superb service and fantastic food   would be delighted to go back 
P =>  Good value and very boutiquey On arrival the reception area to the hotel looked dated and drab but once we were served a complimentary fruit juice and were given our rooms quickly even though we arrived early in the morning we were more impressed  The unrefurbished rooms were a bit dated especially in the bathrooms but they were large and airey and not bad  The refurbised rooms were all full but they looked much nicer and well worth the small extra cost  The service was excellent at the hotel  They even took us to visit the nearby heritage village when we enquired about taxi costs  The only problem we had was they use the rock pool which is the one catering for kids for functions too so it was closed while we were there  The other pool has signs saying quiet please and is totally intollerant of children playing at all which is a great idea if the other pool is open but makes life hard otherwise  When we did mention this to the manager though they did let the kids use the rock pool with the workmen around us setting up for that nights function  so if you have this problem it is worth mentioning it  The food at this hotel is superb better than many much more expensive hotels especially the breakfast  The hotel has very much the feel of an up market french boutique hotel  The prices are good value for Dubai for both the accomodation and food and drinks  
P =>  A Happy Family           Last weekend we were at  Hatta Fort Hotel   amp  for sure we enjoyed a lot      Along with us was our two year old daughter  who got all the attention of the staffs  amp  their pampering with some little goodies at times when she was fussy about anything  She also enjoyed the fun time with her dad  swimming at the Rock Pools designed with safety measures for every age  with its beautiful theme Its always better not to have high expectations  that is one reason why we really enjoyed this trip  Being away from the city life     in the natural surrounding of mountains  amp  staying in Chalets was one reason  but the credit goes to the management and the staffs  friendliness  amp  hospitality which is seen the moment you enter the hotel  amp  receive their warm welcome accompanied with a glass of fress juice which itself is so refreshing  Though we were there long before our check in time  we were escorted to our room in no time after the necessary formalities The basket of fresh fruits after lunch    the BBQ dinner by the pool with live music     and finally the surprise at your room once you plan to retire for the day    these thigns made the stay more exciting For those who have to save a lot just to spend a night of luxury at Burj Al Arab  then the alternative can be  quot Hatta Fort Hotel  as it is quite affordable for a weekend get away and specially in the beauty of nature if not luxury We recommend you go  amp  experience it for yourself coz each of us hold a different opinion as per our point of view  But for sure you wont regret the choice once you are there Regards Mr  amp  Mrs  Saif  th il      
P => Peace in the mountains Spent   nights at the Hatta Fort as part of a trip to Dubai  Whilst Dubai is very impressive it was so nice to escape the mad rush of the city for the peace of the mountains  We were warned that the hotel was a little dated but we found it excellent  We paid extra to stay in the newly renovated suites and it is well worth the money  Fabulous bed and sparkling bathroom  Little touches such as flowers and chocolates on your pillow at night  amp  a basket of fruit when you arrive  It is a Relais  amp  Chateau hotel so expected a good standard but food was better than any we ve had in France  and we ve lived in Paris for   years  Staff are really friendly and helpful and our teenage children enjoyed the archery and putting green and the   pools  It s less than an hour s drive to Dubai which makes it an excellent escape from all the building work in the city  Excellent value for money too  
P =>  The Hotel in the Mountains This is the third time my wife and I have stayed at the Hatta Fort Hotel  We adore everything about it and cannot wait to return again  The manager and his staff are simply the best and everyone there is so attentive to your every need without going over the top  Since our last visit some of the rooms have been refurbished and they are fabulous  The peace and tranquillity after the hub of Dubai is akin to another world  We love the excellent food which is on a par to any leading hotel  with a choice to match  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed  
P =>  Lovely  My husband and I stayed at the Hatta Fort Hotel for our first anniversary  We loved it  The hotel is undergoing some renovation but that did not impact on us at all Our room was huge  with a lovely fruit basket waiting for us  The rooms are like cottages  with high wooden ceilings and lovely balconys  Bathrooms are slightly shabby but fine Food in the Gazebo restuarant was lovely  room service breakfast was one of the best ever It was very quiet and peaceful  not many other guests  so the pool wasn t crowded Overall a fantastic place to spend a romantic weekend  
P =>  A Blissful Escape You know you are someplace special as you step onto your veranda overlooking seas of flowers and showered with bird songs  Spacious rooms  unobtrusive service  a chilled pool for the hottest of days and countless actvities make Hatta Fort Hotel a real treat  Have a manager tour you through the whole property and learn the history of this royal vacation escape turned resort  
P =>  First Class I visited the Hatta Fort Hotel with my fiance in ober      and was extremely impressed  The rooms are beautiful chalet style all with a private balcony and are clean and spacious  Our booking included a set evening meal   we had a   course a la carte meal every night and every meal was fantastic  The hotel had some lovely touches   we were provided with fresh fruit in our room daily and a waiter would bring fruit to us when at the swimming pool  Also  every night when we returned from our meal  the beds had been turned down and fresh flowers and a chocolate were placed on the bed  The staff at the hotel were lovely and nothing was too much trouble for them  We got a taxi from Dubai city and it took about an hour   I think next time we will hire a car so we can explore the Hatta area a little bit more  Hatta Fort is ony about   miles from the border of Oman so we asked at reception if we could have a driver to take us across   this was arranged no problem  I would highly recommend Hatta Fort and will definitely be back  
P =>  Dubai without the crouds My wife  Daughter  her boy friend and I spent   days at Hatta in ust       The hotel couldn t be faulted for service  staff and the rooms  The swimming pools were excellent  Our stay was during the low season and at times we were the only people in the pools  During a game of golf on the desert course one of the waiters brought cool cloths and water out to usA minor problem which may affect people on a budget is the fact that you can only eat in the hotel restaurants  Booking bed and breakfast helps and another little tip is to walk down to the local  quot Township quot  to buy bottled water  lemonade  coke and other treats  These items are dear in the hotel but very cheap down the road  If you don t have transport the hotel will lay on a car to Dubai at about AED    e mail for further information

P =>  OK Hotel as long as you avoid the food Stayed here for   nights on a stopover in e     Room was a standard double and had just been renovated   the whole  th floor has just been redone   they had done a good job Agree with a previous reviewer that the shozers are freezing  i complained and must have got a different staff member as i was told that  quot we always turn off the hot water because tourists like it cold when in Dubai quot     He showed us the lever to turn the hot water back on and that was that Location is OK  the pool is tiny but     restaurants in he hotel all themed  quot American quot   translation pizza  steak  burger  Was too tired to do anything else on the first night so ate there and spent the next two weeks of my holiday suffering from food poisoning  
P =>   Good beds breakfast  I stayed there for   nights in ruary and I wasn t impressed  The room I was given was in the corner of the buiIding and was not soundproof at all  On top of this it was below the aircrafts route and as a result I couldn t get some decent sleep  The room itself was not good  very very narrow  the bed would just fit   and the TV  chair etc were jammed in the corner  not functional at all  The bathroom was decent in size but very outdated  I did not expect at all such an old fashioned shower    On the good side  the bed was very confortable The breakfast was good  although the pastries and croissants were far far from being fresh  The buffet lunch was excellent though  The staff were OK  If you are staying at Deira I recommend the Traders hotel  
P =>   A Pleasant Surprise Not pleased at the hotel I was staying at in downtown Dubai  I decided to take a walk at  am in the morning to check nearby hotels  The Hawthorn was the closest  I walked in  enquired about the rates and asked Reception to show me the room  There was a world of difference between the two hotels  both rated at   Star   I moved in next day and was upgraded  It terms of location  room and service  the Hawthorn is the top of the   Star range  Staff were very helpful  The room rate was also great considering it is Dubai s high season  The restaurant and night club were both nice and very reasonably priced  Internet service was very reasonably priced  must be the cheapest in Dubai  and very reliable  I would strongly recommend this hotel  
P =>   The showers were too cold  After a three month backpacking adventure through Europe I was ready for some luxury Dubai style and splashed out  as much as one can when they re down to their last dollar  and stayed at the Hawthorn Hotel  Dubai is body meltingly hot in ust and I was more than glad to when I arrived at the air conditioned Hawthorn Hotel  However  I was not so impressed with the frosty attitude I got from the Reception Staff  Granted they weren t overtly rude  but I was tired  sweaty and gross and just wanted to go to my room and lie down  They bashed away at their keyboards for an eternity  took my passport and and gave me a keycard  When I asked a simple question about breakfast the staff member could not speak english  she was Scandinavian   My room was nice  yes  The was no view to speak of  but Dubai city isn t exactly the Hanging Gardens of Babylon anyway  My only real complaint is the bathroom  I know Dubai is hot  but despite that once you re in the room with the air con on you do chill down a bit and you might want a hot shower or bath at some stage  My shower did not dispense hot water  In fact none of the taps had hot water  In addition  regardless of the fact the roof top pool is listed as  quot refreshing quot  it s not  It s on the roof and it s bloody hot up there  The rest of the staff were very hospitable  the breakfast was very elaborate and there s a brilliant jeweller on site  The hotel is no where near anything you might want to see in Dubai  unless of course you want to see roadworks  but there are taxis  Whether or not the taxis show up is another matter entirely  so be prepared to wait even if the hotel calls them  
P =>   Nice Hotel With Nice Rates The Hawthorn seems to be a relatively new hotel with new furnishings  The front desk staff were quite nice  but you have to fill out a registration form although your information is already in their computer  The room was well equipped with a mini bar  nice linens  large shower  and good bath products  I ordered an iron  at no charge of course  it was there within fifteen minutes  The lounge called the   ers was great  good food and around ten a band from Bulgaria started with nice music  although a bit loud  The food was good in the lounge and reasonably priced  The concierge was friendly and assisted me in getting a taxi on the day of my departure flight  All in all  a good hotel for      a night  Good price in Dubai  I will be staying there again in ober  
P =>   Life in a Building Site ust really isn t the time to visit here unless you   c plus heat  There is so much building going on that everything is covered in a layers on dust  amp  sand  The hotel has a railway station being built right out the front but inside is OK  Front desk staff are pleasant but seem to take for ever to book you in  amp  check you out  Our room was large and well appointed  Bathroom was clean with all that you would expect  Suprised to learn that the balcony door was lock for my protection as we were on the fifth floor  Some minor problems  no towels one day  tv controls not working  toilet dripping but all were sorted out  buffet style breakfast was great   ask the cook for eggs the way you want  and the wait staff friendly  
P => Great place I am actually a travel agent myself  however  I booked this through a wholesaler  as I would do for my clients  I booked a package which included transfers and a couple of tours and I was met at the airport as specified  Admittedly  I did have to wait a while for the transfer to leave  as they grouped me with someone that was at a hotel near mine  and those passengers for some reason took forever to get through customs  Anyways  I arrived at my hotel and was very happy with the hotel and the room  It was a good size  bathroom was decent size and the hotel was lovely  Good location  walking distance to the souks etc and close to the airport  Great breakfast in the morning  I love it when someone cooks an omelette for me  I was originally supposed to be staying at the Ascot  but after reading reviews on this site  changed my mind  and I m glad I did I mentioned the bit about being a travel agent  as the hotel didn t know this  so it was great to be able to write a good review as any other customer I would recommend the city of merchants tour and the sundowners dune dinner tour which involved some dune bashing in  WD s  then a traditional Arabic dinner after sunset  Fantastic  
P => Excellent Stopover Hotel Stayed here for a two night stopover en route from Australia to UK  arriving at   am in late ember Spacious  clean  comfortable modern hotel with very helpful staff  Surprisingly quiet  apart from the wake up call from the Mosques which could presumably be heard all over the City   ent and reasonably priced self service restaurant with wide range of food  Lots of restaurants on the street outside as well  Set mainly in business area with a    minute walk past small shops  amp  restaurants down to the water taxis on the Creek or use the incredibly cheap taxis to get around Never even got to see the pool on the top floor but will certainly stay there again  
P =>  Fantastic  We booked this hotel from the hotels main website and we payed about    euros per room per night including breakfast  taxes extra      approx  We booked this hotel as we were relocating to dubai and expeted a cheap budget hotel but boy was i in for a surprise  as soon as we pulled up n the taxi we were met by porters who greeted us and took our luggage  We were so amzed by the decor of the lobby that we were convinced we were in the wrong hotel however it turned out we were in the write hotel  The check in process took only a minute and the reception staff were very nice  from here we obviously went to our room where again we were greatly surprised by the size of the room and all its facilities such as large bathroom  tea coffe making faciliies  flat screen tv  free internet access  mini bar and wonderful decor I highly reccomend this hotel and even though its in the city it would make a great base for the pefect sun holiday  the hotel also boasts a nght club with a great bar including a great selection of beers and spirits to choose from as well as a fantastic dance floor There are many resaraunts to choose from and the food is very tasty and great portions There is also a roof top pool and a gym in the hotel and there are many restaraunts available on the street where the hotel is  
P =>  Hawthorn Hotel Deira war      
P => 
P =>   Good Budget Hotel The Hotel was clean and service was excellent  Hotel located in Bur Dubai and is   kms from the Indian Shopping location called Mena Bazaar  which was perfect for my mom and i as we were there to do wedding shopping  The staff are excellent and very helpful  The travel agent in the hotel was very helpful as well  The brekfasts are great  good variety of meals  To get to the new dubai you have to take taxi s which generally try their luck  Hotel is very safe  the area around the hotel looks a bit dodgy but is unbelievably safe  My mom and i would walk back to the hotel at  am and not a soul with bother us  The area comes alive from   pm until about   am as its too hot during the day  Good budget hotel  
P =>   Nice hotel   Uninteresting Location The Highland Hotel was a refuge from the long distance travel and heat of Dubai  but then again anywhere with air con would have been good  We were flying from France to Australia and decided to break the trip up by stopping over night in Dubai  We arranged a shuttle from the airport to the hotel and we think in the long run this may be easier rather than fighting for a cab The location of the hotel isn t all that interesting as you find yourself near the docks of Dubai and no real tourist attractions  Although everything can be reached by a taxi ride of around      mins  heading out on foot means you will no doubt be breathing in a lot of the pollution that dubai has to offer The hotel is modern and clean and the rooms are well dressed and modern  The bed was comfortable and the shower had good pressure The breakfast of which we bought was expensive but seeing there didn t seem to be many other options in the area it was easier to stay in and pay the extra  It was buffet style with everything from Omlettes and Juices to Curry and Naan for breaky One thing we didn t like was the fact that the hotel has a dico   live concert room in their basment  Normally this wouldn t worry us but the fact we were flying half way around the world and had to be awake at     am made it a little annoying  When I phoned reception and asked them what time the music would finish she politetly told me that they would be finishing at  am  Considering we were on the  th floor and could still feel the bass I wonder if they realise how this effects the stay of their guests All in all the hotel is nice but over priced for the location and the breakfast  still we were comfortable and managed to get some good sleep  eat well and had a good sleep  in the afternoon   
P =>  Highland ups and downs I arrived to this hotel with    other people  family extended family  all aged       I didnt have much to do with the hotel staff and my mum paid for me to stay  She hated the hotel so much  she didnt like the staff which were mostly immigrants from India and the cleaners were mostly from the Philipines  they were lovely   The Hotel  The rooms are ok  theres a small fridge  a tv with some good channels  a really nice bathroom with towels shampoos etc and the beds are comfortable  But on the down side their sea view isnt great  you can barely see the sea  unless you look through gaps of buildings in the distance  The hotel has a nightclub and a restaraunt which is also a sort of nightclub so there loud music in the night  I could hear them but it wasnt so bad that you couldnt sleep over it  The staff were a bit dodgy and yes you really do have to keep your luggage padlocked  The hotel has a really nice swimming pool on the roof and also a little jacuzzi which the kids really enjoyed  There was a life guard and he was a pervert  This may sound a little horrible but with most the staff being immigrants from India expect Indian style service not Dubai style service  The hotel has a small sauna which no one really used  Apart from my sister and cousin  and also a gym that no one used but it looked nice  They also have high speed internet connection in a computer room which doesnt cost a great deal of money to use No one really used the swimming pool and there wasnt many tourists at the hotel  just what seemed like immigrants from mostly India The Location  Taxis are very easy to catch and you can take them to nearby restaurants  some of which are fantastic  This hotel is in a very immigrant area  its run down looking and not the cleanest  In the evening the outside of the hotel is packed out with Pakistanis who will perve on you and believe me  nothing will stop them  This really got me angry  there was just no respect for women from these people  The only reason im mentioning where the immigrants were from is so you can have a better understanding and idea of how it was  especially if youve been to Pakistan  which I have  and India  which I might   On the plus side the taxi ride to the beach  a gorgeous beach  isnt very far and neither is Dubai zoo which when I went  had lion cubs  Overall the location was more like India than Dubai but youre just a taxi ride away from the real Dubai  I wouldnt recommend lone female travelers but a bunch of guys on a budget would probably love it  Oh and they did do breakfast  the chef made really nice omlettes and breakfasts were over all nice but make sure you get there early or you wont have anywhere to sit For lunch  you can take a taxi to mcdonalds or Pizza hut  the pizza hut staff were lovely  which arent too far away  I recommend Pizza hut especially if youre travelling with children  its a good atmosphere  
P =>  great location the best part about the hotel is the location 
P =>   awful   loud thumping music and dubious nighttime activity Stayed this week for a stopover between India and the UK  arrived at      to be greeted by loud thumping music from the nightclub on the ground floor which was still shaking the walls of the bedroom and bed on the  th floor at       There were clearly transactions taking place in the lobby with rooms being hired out for very short time periods and I have never felt more uncomfortable when on checking out later  females were being paid openly in the lobby for clearly services delivered in the night  horrid experience  
P =>  Acceptable After reading reviews we asked for a room far away from the loud noise from the night club  When arriving   am we got the room      practically above the club  Got a new room the next day  on the  th floor  still loud noise and had to visit the pharmacy for earplugs  They are not very nice as you are not used to sleep with plugs The hotel belongs to an Indian hotel chain and thus the breakfast is targeted for indian guests but acceptable The beds are targeted for indian guests and thus skandinavian guests are just too big for them  We asked  when booking  for a twin bed room but did not get that You can have beer     AED for a draught  and wine    AED for a glass of house chardonnay  in the hotel but unfortunately that includes high volume indian music The hotel has a central position     m to a large Carrifour supermarket     m to the creek     m to the busstation  taxis easily available outside the hotel     m to affordable excellent food in the Ascot hotel just down the street  Also a pub in the Ascot hotel if you are ready to inhale the smoke  terrible   By taxi to the tower area    AED  and   AED to the Madinah area  
P =>  From the Highland s to the Highland Stayed here for   nights  found the staff pleasant and courteous  The room was very good  clean and tidy  as you would expect  The hotel location in Bur Dubai was ok  handy for the bus station  cheaper to get around  only   Dirhams one way approx   p to get to Jumeira Beach  amp  the Burj Al Arab hotel   The location is handy as there are a few hotel bars in the area  I would not recommend it for families with kids as apart from the hotel pool on the   th floor not a lot of beach for them to play on This hotel  I would recommend as a good choice for a few days stopover or a long weekend  
P =>  Highland Highlight  We stayed at the Highland for   nights in e and loved every moment of it  It is located in Bur Dubai on the fringe of the old  spice and gold souks  and new  wild wadi etc  dubai  Excellent value for anyone travelling on a budget Pros   Nice budget central hotel  good location between old dubai and new dubai  Good clean spacious room with massive bathroom and awesome airconditioning   Reasonable price  reasonable quality  speedy delivery room service  Nice quiet rooftop pool and spa for relaxing after a busy day of shopping and exploring   BIG HOT buffet breakfast  Rock Pub  quot Rock City quot  located on the mezzanine level of the hotel with a fillipino rock band covering heaps of classic rock tunes from black sabbath  zeppelin  deep purple  metallica etc  Made going out and getting plastered extremely easy as we didnt have to go very far at all   Friendly Housekeeping staff  especially Gorman on level   Cons   Bit hard to get taxi from directly in front of hotel as it is on a corner where traffic rounds very fast giving potential taxis no time to stop to fetch you  Need to walk about    m away from the corner to have any chance of getting a taxi    quot Complimentary quot  tea and coffee in room is NOT free    Beer prices in rock club pretty outrageous  having said that though  all alcohol in dubai is extremely expensive and this was one of the cheaper bars we visited   Semi friendly reception staff  Hotel more oriented towards Indian   Arab holiday makers than western tourists 
P => Nice rooms I recommed the Highland  I would say the good points outweight the bad ones  Lets start with the good things  The rooms are very nice  good design  big and clean  The bathroom is also clean  The location is safe and its not far from the creek  And the price  at     US Dollars per night for a double  you won t find something of this quality in Bur Dubai for less  AS for the bad things  Despite the good location  it isn t that easy to catch a taxi  Inside the hotel  the reception isn t very inviting  and the check in is slow  In the rooms  be careful  u get charged for using the tea and coffee sachets  AND most importantly  demand a room on a high floor  The hotel has a nightclub  we stayed on the third floor  but could still hear some faint thumping 
P =>   Never Go Back     I visited Dubai with family in the month of ch      and stayed at Hotel Highland They gave us four rooms on different floor regardless of my request a week before in advance  I read reviews and asked in advance for a room higher up and I was given a room on the third floor which was still very noisy The staffs  especially at reception desk  were very rude I requested extra bed and they gave us one of most disgusting and greasy bed I have ever seen  I would rather sleep on the floor then on that bed  The breakfast was the worst we have ever had Highland Hotel is not deserved even one star Please search more and choose other hotel  
P =>   Highly Recommended Hi  I visited Dubai with family in the month of       and stayed at Hotel Highland  Given below is the portion from my travel blog which relates to this hotel   quot      When we reached hotel  we were welcomed by friendly staff there  After some waiting  our check in was at noon   we were allocated room some three hours before our normal check in time  Hotel seems to be a good one from outside though the reception and lobby area is undergoing renovation works  But that is not much of inconvenience as such  We were given room on  th floor  When we reached our room  we found it very neat and clean  A very nice accommodation by   star standards  Toilets were clean  equipped with tub     hour running hot and cold water  Rooms are with TV having satellite connections  There was a hotspot internet facility in the hotel but I found the rates very expensive     AED for an hour and    AED for the day   I didn t opted for it  Making international calls from hotel too was very expensive  Soon I found an alternative from it in form of calling cards which you can buy from any shops which can be found just next to hotel  There cards can be used in any of the commonly found pay phone booths on the streets  As we had a long flight and my kid was tired  we decided and then to explore the next option      quot In nutshell  highly recommended for stay in Dubai  This is a good hotel for family  very centrally located and nicley priced  Hope this will be of help for others  
P =>   Would go back I stayed at the Highland with my mum and aunt and had a good stay  It is true that there is a night club on the ground floor fit for pervy indian men but as long as you stay away and request a room on either the  th or  th floor you will be fine  The room was lovely and clean and the location I felt was perfect For those who want to be near the Meena Bazar should stay here as its only a   min walk up the road  My friend was staying at the Palm Beach Hotel which was a minute up the road from the Highland and she prefered my hotel  to the point where she was going to switch hotels The manager at the Hotel was lovely and very helpful  breakfast was good although they charge you if you want an Omlet which I thought was silly not trying to be tight The had a swimming pool which was quiet most of the time and a gym  The food at the Coral restaurant was lovely  didnt manage to visit the other restaurants in the hotel My friend and I went to the Rock City club in the Hotel and had a fab time  they had a live band and also played arabic R amp B music  They have pool tables there too and no pervy indian men were to be found there    If I ever go back to Dubai I would stay there again    
P =>   Cheap Cheerful and Clean Booked through hotels com  breakfast was included although I didn t make it down in time on any of my   days   Blame that on the nightclub  quot Rock City quot  downstairs and of course the girls   The nightly live music was classic rock and was headbangingly good  I would concur that this is an excellent place for singles  I had a riot  o  However be aware as a single person booking  you cannot have   people staying in your room so a small charge is made if you want to increase the number of occupants in your room  even if only temporarily  o Food was middling in the  quot family quot  Indian restaurant downstairs  but the dancing girls and live music made up for it  despite it being played so loud the waiter could not make out what I wanted and brought something totally not what I ordered   It was still ok though  Nice roof top Jacuzzi and small pool too  I took a junior suite and it was nice and big with a smart new bathroom and a flat screen TV too  All in all  a very nice stay  the staff were excellent to  I would recommend here if you want a lively place that is way better value than the big chain hotels  Despite it being not ideally located  taxis are everywhere and cost next to nothing  Good Chinese restaurant and an Irish pub just down the road within easy walking distance  but prob better off grabbing a cab and heading to the ina which is about   mins and       in a taxi  Best bars I found there were The Barasti and Bhudda  both in hotels and Bhudda is where the money and the famous go  Dubai Desert Creek Golf Club does a cracking full English breakfast too by the way   
P =>  great hotel to stay in dubai highley recemmended i have stayed in this hotel since      and just love the service that is proveded the friendly staff room service is there when you need it      
P => Respected place  We stayed at  th floor any lower and its loud music till  am from night club down stairs Good service clean place  Just ask for  th floor on wards  
P =>   Comfortable and Pleasent Stay I stayed here on the  th dec      until   th dec      I was a single female traveller abit worried about staying alone  if though i heard Dubai was safe It was fantastic  I checked in without any problems  porter brought my suitcases up for me  even ripped off all the security tags for me  PThe manager Mahesh Kumar was lovely  He showed me how the AC and all the amenities worked in the rrom In the hotel lobby is an Excursion company called Suncity Tours  who have amazing excursions going on for a reasonable price  They are also very helpful and polite  I didn t really wake up to have breakfast while I was there  but one morning I did and it was a buffet style breaky with a large variety of dishes  warm and cold In the room is a food menu from the Restaurant downstairs  they have a good variety of dinners and lunches  Very cheap too    try the chilli Chicken The hotel DOES have   clubs however I was on the  rd floor  but by the time I came in from a hard day travelling out in the sun  I was too tired to acknowledge the club and the noise and use to fall straight to sleep  I actually found it difficult to get myself out in the morning Very close by to Deira  gold souk  spice market  mina bazzar  carefour  boat creeks  Jumerih beach is about      mins away in taxi not expensive at all Airport was about   mins away  However the Hotel does provide a shuttle service  If getting a taxi it s around       The hotel provides facilities for safety box in the back office of the reception Overall realli good hotel  Dont get put off about the noise not really a big deal  by the time you get back at night your too tired to realise whats going on Will be staying here in march     If anyone wants to ask any questions you can email me redrina    yahoo com 
P =>   Far better that it s two stars suggest  We stayed here for   weeks during Ramadan and found it to be a wonderful hotel  The staff were friendly and helped us find all the best excursions and gave helpful advice on how best to get the most out of our stay in Dubai  Compared to Hotels in the UK with a similar star rating  this place was a palace  It s not luxurious  but it s clean and in a great location  Very easy to get a cab from outside the hotel  and in a city where cabs are a must  that was excellent   I m going back to Dubai next year and fully intend to stay there again  I would recommend it to anyone on a budget and staying in Dubai for a while  
P =>  Loved the food it is a great hotel and you must visit this hotel whenever you go to dubai  great food and great restarants     very nice location specially the airport service is great                      
P =>   Great place to see the real Dubai If you want to see the City of Dubai this Hotel is in the best location  You can walk to all the souks and get a real feel for the city  See the areas that the normal tourists dont see  We found people very helpfull and loved every minute  The Hotel was good  room nice size   make sure you are above  th floor as it can be noisy disco below dont advise you go  and breakfast a good selection to chose from  The front desk very helpfull but watch out for organized trips as they can be more expensive  Easy to get taxi if you want to go to the beach or the big shopping malls  Enjoy Dubai before it gets to big  
P =>  Lots of pretty girls Went to stay in the highland on a last minute business meeting  was impressed with the setup  Breakfast was a buffet  excellent news if you like a feast  Although situated in old dubai the area is pleasant with cabs available  The travel desk was very helpful and became a good friend  The club bar in the hotel called dawat was very nice  lots of pretty girls dancing for your pleasure  if you like that sort of stuff this is the place for you  
P =>   Nice place  I have just come back from   nights at the Highland Hotel  For the price we paid this hotel was excellent  The breakfast was lovely  buffet style with loads of choices and fresh fruit  The rooms were more than adequate for sleeping and showering in  I would not recommend EITHER of the two bars  One called Daawat is full of men getting cheap thrills from young girls dancing  ok if you like that kind of thing  and the other one called Rock City is empty and extortionate  We paid     for two vodka and lemonades  If you looking for a good night out walk two minutes down the road to the Palm Beach Club   great place The hotel is in a good location  walkable distance to Meena Bazaar  great for cheap electricals  and short cab rides to Jumeirah Beach  Main Town Centre and all Shopping Mall  Cabs are easy to get from outside the hotel  Staff are brilliant  Only one thing  the Highland is located in  quot Old Dubai quot  so the local men STARE at any women  Although they are harmless    There are not many women in the area  If this will freak you out  then it would be better to stay nearer Jumeirah beach where there are more tourists  Overall a safe place with a great taste of the real Dubai  Would stay there again  
P =>  You can do better    I was booked into the Highland through Emirates  I m surprised they would have their name associated with this hotel  I read reviews and asked a week in advance for a room higher up and I was given a room on the third floor which was still very noisy  even my earplugs didn t drown out the noise  I found a few cockroches found in my bathroom too  The area wasn t the greatest my friends that live in Dubai were surprised I was staying in that area as it is known for brothels  Anyway I would book at pearl residences next time which was my original choice and it was a few   cheaper  
P =>   Good location  star hotel My partner and myself stayed here the last week in ober and had a wonderful week  The hotel is in a good location and its  stars are well deserved  We stayed up on the  th floor so the noise from the nightclub was not really a problem for us  We went to the nightclub on our first night after arriving and it was our last time going there  it was a little seedy  amp I d imagine if I wasn t with my partner he would have gotten plenty of offers from all the Asian girls in there The towels and the bed linen were changed every single day  which was great  The room was a good size with a massive king size bed  The usual TV fridge etc was also in the room  we had no problem getting an iron amp ironing board from housekeeping when we needed them either We also had the paper brought to us in our room a few mornings with breakfast  After the first morning we realised that it cost the same to have room service bring up your breakfast as it did to have it in the Coral Restaurant downstairs  So we opted to have it in our room most days Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were extremely polite  amp helpful especially the nighttime manager  be they could actually teach a thing or two to workers in western hotels  In relation to the phone in the hotel you can buy call cards in the shop up the road for    or    dirhams and use them on the hotel phone so all that you are charged is a few cent connection fee  I think it works out at about   cent which is great  The staff at reception will explain how to use them but they are very easy amp a great idea The pool is quite small but ideal if u want to relax after a days sightseeing after all you hardly go to Dubai to sit at the pool all day  Taxis can be hailed outside the hotel no problem and are very cheap to get around in  You really have no other choice but to use them  Jumeriah beach is about   minutes away in taxi amp costs on average   dirhams about     You can pay  dirhams to get into the public Beach Park and is well worth it as it s immaculately kept So overall I would have no problem going back to this hotel or recommending it to family or friends as its a great  star hotel  If your looking for  star quality you re better off staying at the Burj Al Arab but if your looking for a reasonably priced hotel in good location this is perfect  
P =>  Excellent choice Having just spent a week at the Highland Hotel  this was a more than adequate budget hotel  It deserves much more than the    rating it has been given  The rooms were very clean and towels were changed daily  The staff couldn t do enough for you Admittedly it was the beginning of Ramadan so I m not able to comment on the restaurants and nightclub in the hotel There was always a variety of food for breakfast  ranging from freshly cooked to order omelettes to curry     There are plenty of shops nearby and the gold souk is walking distance  Only thing I would warn people of is using the hotel telephones for a   minute phone call to England cost me                        
P =>  HIgh Five For The Highland This is more than an adequate budget hotel  If you want   star facilities then you are better off staying at the Burj Arab  The service was very good and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly  The staff did not expect tips but I was forever tipping them as I know what a rubbish wage they are on and plus they are just grateful for a job  It was a clean and polished place There was a bit of rush at breakfast for a table but we always obtained one  True the din from the nightclubs situated within the hotel might keep you awake but just keep the earplugs in  alternatively take a strong sedative   Don t use the hotel phone to call home  just like in any other hotel  buy a phone card as the Highland s phone rates are a little too high  The Ga nightclub within the hotel is definately worth a visit  or maybe even a couple  The distance to the Jumeriah Beach Park is about    mins in a taxi ride   should cost you about    dirams  peanuts  and you can easily hail cabs outside the hotel just like anywhere in Dubai If you don t want to eat at the Highland then don t be afraid to check out the local restaurants  delicious food and top quality for hardly any money  Finally I have to mention there is a small parade of shops just next to the Highland who do the most amazing fruit juices I have tasteted   I certainly got all my five fruit portions in everyday from there  
P =>  Value for money  We had a great experience at the Highland  The service was excellent  our suite was quite large  we had a lovely view and the hotel was convenient  We were minutes walk fom the gold souks and the beach was only minutes on the taxi The only average thing about the hotel was that there wasn t much variety with the breakfast  usual croissants  jam  tea or cereal or fruit  The breakfast room was quite small  so it was a dash for tables  There is a pool on the roof top  again not that big but it was quiet when we were there so quite peaceful Overall  I would definitely stay there again  
P =>  Quite Good This was not a bad hotel at all  rooms nice  well appointed and clean and a nice quiet pool and jacuzzi on the roof in the sun  The reception were quite helpful and friendly too The breakfast was a bit of a disappointment with the room crowded and chaotic and some rather unconventional choices of food  The aircon in rooms was a bit noisy and could have done with servicing You want to stay on a higher floor though because that night club can throw out some noise We would definately return  especially given the good rates that are available  This isnt the Burj  but you are not paying for the burj   thats about as fair as I can be really  
P =>  highland is the best just got back from   weeks in the highland hotel in bur dubai  and it was brilliant   we we r picked up from the airport at   pm by the hotel coach and taken to the hotel it took about    minits to get there then we checked in and shown our room as i went with myself and   daughters they gave uyp a large suite with a queen size bed and a fold up camp bed   i hacked the camp bed for   nights and then politley asked if they had another bed and it was no problemto change it to a proper divan bed   they only use fold up beds if your only staying a short while they didnt realise we we r there for   weeks the room was immaculate it was on the  th floor away from the disco in the lobby  no noise what so ever  we had a bath and shower as well and we had a fridge and a television which had a movie channel in english saw some great films there was water waithing for us which we needed  every morning there was newspapers delivered to us free  as we stayed bed and breakfast we went down to breakfast it was presented lovely all layed out buffet style with tea coffee orange and apple juices  and trays of peeled fruit watermelon and kiwis as well the staff could not do enough for you and no they wernt doing it for the tips which we gave  they did it to make us a comfy as possible we had use of an iron and ironing board the rooms we r cleaned every other daythere was not   complaint about this hotel there was a money xchange but the hotel rate was bad so we used   just down from the hotel the hotel is rearly well situated not far from anything rearlly jumeira just up the road gold souk just the other way the creek within walking distance  as is burjaman mall this hotel is portrayed as a    but i would give it   plus       
P =>  Nice little hotel to stay I stayed at the hotel in        Value for money for a   star hotel  Located in the  computer  amp  accessories  business area of Bur Dubai  Within   mins  by car bus   bus stop situated in front of hotel   Good bus service as well  of Nasser Square where shops selling electronic  amp  hifi equipments are concentrated  The Hotel service is satisfactory but should book higher level rooms to avoid the noises of the night clubs situated on the   F of the hotel  The surrounding area of the hotel is quite safe  even at night   
P =>  Staying at the Highland Hotel   Bur Dubai We stayed at the Highland Hotel in       and were happy with the location  within walking distance of Bur Juman Centre  the creek and close to the port  There is also a supermarket quite close by  Comfortable for a   star hotel  although the lower floors get lots of noise from the discos on the first floor  if staying request a high level   If you are looking for a   star hotel would definately recommend this one   
P => 
P => Wonderful hotel We came home yesterday from wonderful   days at Hilton Dubai Creek   and have nothing to complain about  The reason why we choose this hotel is because of the location  Close to the airport  close to the goldsouk etc  and because it has shuttlebus service to the sisterhotel Hilton Jumeira Beach   so we could enjoy the beach as well  
P =>   Very Good Hotel Good Location Dubai is not the place it once was  Unsure whether the changes I have seen in the last    years are progression or disappointment That aside  Dubai certainly isn t cheap anymore The Hilton Creek is perhaps    years old  The location is good  taxis are relatively cheapThis trip was for leisure  We were checked in about   hours ahead of the official check in time and this was appreciated after flying through the night The hotel has a daily shuttle to the Hilton Jumeirah beach  you need to book in advance and is free  Out at   am and back at  pm  This was ideal for us  Our room had a great view of the creek  beautiful bathroom The hotel has a pool located on it s rooftop  Neither the pool nor the area is that big  but each time we visited  we managed to secure lounges It offers fantastic views over the creek and city  especially at sunset I was not impressed with breakfast  since we were room only  had it once and ate elsewhere after The hotel leaves a copy of Time Out magazine in the bedroom drawer   this is excellent for finding great deals on restuarants  
P =>   Excellent we really enjoyed our stay  We stayed at the Hilton Dubai Creek for   nights from the  th to the   th of   We paid extra for an executive plus room and it was well worth it  The view from the room was amazing looking out over the city on two sides of the room  The room was big and had a very nice bathroom area with a jacuzzi  We were able to use the executive lounge during the day which had free tea coffee soft drinks and every evening at six complimentary food was served with drinks until eight  Breakfast was either continental in the executive lounge or the full fry downstairs in the restaurant There was also access to free internet and wi fi in the lounge The hotel has a small gym and there is a outdoor pool on the top floor with an outdoor bar and great views of the city  This pool is small There was one restaurant open while we were there called the Glasshouse  The food was good  Eating out in any hotel restaurant in Dubai can tend to be pricey especially if your having a bottle of wine  Cheapest bottle can often be    euro The hotel also had a free shuttle to the Hilton Jumeriah beach each morning at eleven returning at four  You must book the night before  There is a lovely beach at the other Hilton  From the Hilton Jumeriah there are other free shuttles to the different shopping Malls and they return back to the Emirates Hotel just behind the Hilton Dubai Creek as late as   pm The best thing we found about this hotel were the Excellent Staff  They were always friendly and pleasant and could not do enough to help us  They made numerous phone calls for us throughout the week and gave us great advice  The stay we had in the Hilton Dubai Creek was the best and most enjoyable stay we have had in any hotel and we will definitely be returning Thank you  
P =>   Lovely Rooms with full lenght views Lovely hotel  in good location of city  with fantastic views of the city Although this hotel has a celebritity restaurant  I would advise checking out some of the restaurants a few blocks from this hotel  which offer more local dishes  at very reasonable prices  and lovely atmosphere  The celebritity restaurant menu  was boring  and what you can eat at home  with no local dishes on the menu  which isn t what tourist are looking for Beautiful rooms with full size windows  and very unusual rooms  which makes this hotel very different  Before bed  the staff not only prepare your bed  but light candles  give you fresh towels  just adding to the atmosphere of a lovely hotel  
P =>   Comfortable short stay in Old Dubai We stayed for two nights at the Hilton Dubai Creek in tember       just after Ramadan finished  and the Eid feast after Ramadan was on   the hotel is about a    minute drive from the airport and the taxi fare was quite cheap by Australian standards   around     from the airport to hotel  The hotel has a lovely rooftop pool with fantastic views over Dubai s skyscrapers  Note that the pool is not covered and as such we tended to have our swim early morning with a cappuccino by the poolside  as it would be too warm in the middle of the day  The hotel is about a    minute walk from the new metro stations  however one has to walk through a bit of a dilapitated neighbourhood to get to these and I probably wouldn t recommend that single female travellers walk alone especially at night   we got stared at a lot and I was with my partner  Taxi rides to the Jumeirah beach region are also on the cheap side   I think we paid about           to get to the Madinat Jumeirah entertainment complex  Hilton Dubai Creek is a good choice for people wanting a  quot stopover quot  between flights for a night or so  but there really wasn t that much around the hotel so for holidaymakers  I would recommend a Jumeirah based hotel on the beach  We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton  and if we wanted to stay one night in Dubai to break up flight sectors we would gladly stay here again  however if we come for longer I would probably choose a beach hotel  The hotel was spotlessly clean  and I can t fault the hotel amenities or staff  
P =>   Style and Class on the Creek We arrived at just before  am and were in our room within    minutes  it was Ramadan so a little quieter perhaps   We were upgraded to a suite through our Hilton Honors membership which was excellent  The staff in this hotel are friendly and very helpful which is not always the case in Dubai  We like this hotel because it is stylish  only a short drive from the airport and away from Jumeriah beach  This side of the creek offers excellent restaurants  Legends at The Creek Golf Club is excellent for steak  we have yet to try Verre by Gordon Ramsay in the Hilton  The roof top pool and bar has an excellent view over Dubai  This is an ideal hotel for couples wanting a more sophisticated hotel with plenty of dining options around  Although they operate a shuttle bus to the beach it is a business style hotel and not suitable for children  
P =>   Good stay We stayed as a stopover from Australia to the UK for one night as we were planning a longer stay on the way home  The Hotel is in an excellent location for access to the creek  airport and souks  The economic downturn meant accommodation was well priced and a suite including airport transfers was available for a reasonable rate  the corner room had fantastic views  the food  pool and facilities were all great  This hotel is an excellent smaller   star close to the airport with access to old Dubai  We stayed on Jumeriah Beach on the way back so had a taste of both sides of Dubai  
P =>   Best breakfast in dubai served by superb staff I know there are bigger   better located more opulent beach hotels  but the hilton creek for me is the best hotel I have stayed in and I have stayed in quite a few in dubai  The actual hotel is impressive  the rooms enormous  the views superb but the winning conbination of fantastic attentive staff coupled with the best breakfast in dubai make it my number one hotel in dubai from now on Many thanks to Lax and all the staff  everyone of them  for making it a holiday not to be forgotten and boy do I miss my eggs benidict now  
P =>   Still a great Hotel   We stayed here in y and returned for   nights this month prior to staying at the jumeirah Beach Hotel  Had a fantastic time here and the staff were all great  in particular the Barman at the pool  Kevin  The Pool  Breakfast  Hotel location and staff attitude top notch  Will be back in ember   Just one complaint  why no alcohol after     pm in the executive lounge when they serve it in the restaurants and issimo s Bar   Think its cost saving not Ramadan   
P =>   Excellent Excellent Excellent MB amp SB Oswestry UKJust come back from a one week stay at the Hilton Dubai Creek  What can I say apart from the above  The room had the wow factor as soon as we opened the door and the view we had was fantastic  If you are staying here make sure you get a breathtaking view of the creek  You could see the Burj Dubai  Burj Al Arab and even the QE  from our room All the staff are very helpful and courteous and a special mention has to go to Kamal who looked after the pool bar excellently and nothing was to much trouble for him  Cant say one bad word about the staff at all We loved it when we came back to our room each evening to find fresh towels on our bed but made into the shapes of different creatures  We had an elephant  swans and a butterfly to name just a few  Very original idea The hotel is close to lots of attractions around the creek but if you are looking for a complete beach holiday then I suggest you look for a resort location on Jumeriah beach  The hotel did run a shuttle bus each morning to the sister Hilton on the beach which was great  It runs at   am and returns at  pm Like other people have said in other reviews Ramadan is not the best time of year to go as you cant eat or drink in public and all cafes and restaurants in all the Malls etc were closed until  pm  Alcohol couldnt be drank until after     pm and even then you were restricted to wear you could drink  It didnt really affect our holiday as we had the great breakfasts every morning in the Glasshouse which were fab  These kept us going all day so we only had to get an evening meal Pool is small but is adequate and the views are stunning  Poolside bar for snacks was also very convenient and we ate here a couple of nights and the prices were not to bad  If you want to have an evening meal in one of the two Gordon Ramsey restaurants make sure you have lots of money in your wallet  Verre will write it off and the Glasshouse will severely dent it Overall a great hotel  Would def recommend staying here but like I said if you want a beach holiday I would look at hotels further down the road  
P =>   Great for enjoying the town This is a nice hotel  We stayed two days in the executive with view on the skyscrapers  very impressive views  The advantage of this hotel is the view on the skyscrapers and its favorable location for exploring the old town  However  if you come to Dubai for the beaches  than there are much better alternatives  
P =>   An excellent and central location Stayed here with my wife overnight to break the flights between Paris and Perth  Room spacious and scrupulously clean  reception staff courteous and helpful  Room service very good  Would choose this hotel again for a longer stay in Dubai  
P =>   Great hotel for city break but not for vacations Hilton Dubai Creek is one of best hotels which i stayed in  Design is beautiful and hotel is very modern  The rooftop swimming pool is fantastic  Food  amp  drinks were great  Customer service   excellent    except front desk and conciarge department   Perfect location for people staying on business  not really for young people which looking for fun and entertainment  Free shuttle bus to the beach was very good idea to give guests opportunity spend day on great Hilton Jumeirah beach  I would say  this hotel is great for city break but not for a vacations  GOOD ADVICE for everybody who would like have lots fun over there  don t plan trip to UAE in september   ramadan   You can t event drink water in public  country is very quiet and lots bars  amp  entertainments are closed  
P =>  Great choice for the Dubai Creek area This is a good choice if you want to stay near Dubai creek on business or pleasure or you are just looking for somewhere comfortable to stay close to the airport Rooms are spacious and modern  and you may be lucky enough to get a room with views of the creek  The rooftop swimming pool is a real bonus  The traditional Dubai souks are a short taxi ride away  The new Dubai shopping mall is about    mins away by Taxi We didn t eat in the hotel other than for breakfast  which have to say was pretty average Great hotel for a few days  but if you are planning a longer holiday stay  you might want to choose one of the resort hotels with more extensive facilities and grounds 
P =>   Perfect  Just perfect    We stayed here for a week on our honeymoon and the hotel was simply fantastic  We booked a corner room with a creek view and we were not disappointed  The room was huge   and so was the bed The hotel staff couldn t do enough for you   with every little detail looked after The rooftop pool is superb  in my opinion the best in Dubai  and if you want the beach  the hotel offer a free transfer to the Hilton at the beach Our rate included breakfast and this was a fantastic start to the day   never before have I been so keen to make it to breakfast  In the hotel is Gordon Ramsey s Verre   not as good as Claridges  in my opinion  but still pretty good and a sign of how strong food in Dubai is becoming  
P =>  Brilliant  We stayed for a two day stopover on our way to Egypt  We decided on this hotel because we wanted to visit the souks  which are close  and we didn t want to stay in crowded and noisy large hotels surrounded by construction work   we were definitely justified in our choice We booked two executive rooms and the extra cost was definitely worth it with free airport transfers  free breakfast  access to executive lounge all day with free softdrinks or tea coffee and snacks and free internet access  and a two hour  happy hour  every evening with free alcohol and very substantial hot snacks  we didn t need to eat dinner either night   We arrived very early   about  am   after a long flight and our rooms were ready for us  The staff made us feel very welcome and suggested we freshen up  have some breakfast in the lounge and then take a dip in the rooftop pool   which we did   welcome indeed  Staff everywhere were polite  helpful and friendly   the pool guy brought us glasses filled with ice  unasked  for our bottled water  the exec bar guy made us special cocktails and always filled our glasses up to the brim before happy hour ended  and the cleaning staff were proffessional and thorough  always remembering to replace used items  We felt very pampered The hotel itself is very classy   all chrome and glass   and the rooms are stunning  Our very spacious corner exec room had two floor to ceiling glass walls with wonderful views over the creek to new Dubai and to the desert in the other direction   did t close the curtains once   The furnishings were first class and the beautiful marble  chrome and glass bathroom had everything you need and a very nice view from the spa bath We didn t eat dinner in the restaurants but had a beautiful breakfast in the Glasshouse   a very substantial and tasty buffet The rooftop pool is fairly small  there weren t many people there so this wasn t a problem for us  but has stunning views and is very clean and well maintained  If you need your fix of sunbathing on the beach you can catch the free shuttle to the sister hotel at Jumeirah Beach   departs at   am and returns at  pm each day  about a    minute trip   We caught the shuttle there to have a look before our lunch at the Burj al Arab  a great experience   and  although it looked to be a lovely hotel  we were glad we weren t staying there as the pool and lobby were crowded with people   just not our idea of a relaxing break The hotel is only      minutes drive from the airport and a short taxi ride  about    AUD    English pounds  to Dubai Mall and the Burj Dubai  We actually found the taxis quite reasonably priced and used them to take us around to see all the fascinating buildings I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dubai  unless you particularly want to be on the beach  and I will definitely stay there again next time I m travelling that way  
P =>   Very modern and pricey hotel We stayed for   nights bed and breakfast prior to boarding a cruise at Port Rushid  The location was away from many sightseeing spots apart from seeing the dhows being loaded and unloaded at the near by quays  Taxis however were the best valued item in Dubai surprisingly and we used them extensively  The hotel reception was all glass and polished steel and our arrival was dealt with speed and a professional approach  The standard room  on the eighth floor  was very large with floor to ceiling windows and had a view of the creek looking eastwards to Port Rushid in the distance  The black marble bathroom was large and well stocked with cosmetic products as you would expect in a    hotel  The full breakfast had a wide selection buffet but you could also order from the menu freshly cooked additional items  We did not eat dinner in the very expensive Gordon Ramsey s inhouse restaurant but there is an inhouse coffee shop which is more reasonably priced  An excellent hotel but rather pricey but then it is Dubai  
P =>   Room with a View  Stayed   nights at Dubai Creek Hilton and loved it  I was on   th floor and had a panoramic view  at least mostly panoramic  view of Dubai  The walls were actually windows and I never closed them  Thats big as at home I don t hardly open blinds  travel a lot too   The hotel is   min taxi from Centre Mall  where you can get on the Tour Bus for the city  It is on other side of Dubai from the housing developments  Dubai Mall  most stores in world  and Mall of Emirates  ski slope   etc  However  I would stay again  Great executive floor  The Service was Impeccable  Gavin  in Exec lounge and the Concierge fellas were awesome  Internet can be suspect in hotel and is VERY expensive  as it was in a few cities in Europe       bucks a day  but free in Executive lounge  Hotel is    mins from Airport without traffic so it can be a place of value when in Dubai  Some top designer designed it and it has a Gordon Ramsey from Hells Kitchen tv show restaurant in it  Good breakfast  Service is phenomenal  
P =>   Fab hotel  Book here if you want a brill holiday  wow what can i say  this hotel is phenomenal  marble floors  walls  modern interior  friendly polite staff   couldn t do more to please you here   rooftop swimming pool  large spacious rooms  huge bathroom  excellent maid service  we stayed here a long weekend and did not want to leave  we booked an executive room which comes with transfers  a fabulous choice of breakfast  executive lounge  incl  drinks and food such as fruit  scones  pastries during the day   hrs of happy hour    pm where you can have any alcoholic drinks or soft drinks for free  situated on the top   floors of the hotel giving a great view   amazing  definately worth the extra  you are constantly brought cold towels when sunbathing by the pool to cool you down along with ice tea free of charge  staff are fab here  always smiling  a shuttle bus runs from   am and brings you back at  pm  free of charge from the other hilton hotel on the beach     the beach is gorg white sandy beaches and the water is hot   like a big bath lol so definately go here  dhow dinner cruises at night are great too   only     dirham for   people   sails up and down dubai creek for  hours but night time is still about   degrees here so will still be hot even when the sun isnt around any longer so drink plenty water  weather during day is hot hot hot   not that i was complaining  all hotel rooms restaurants shopping malls are fully air conditioned  taxis are no more than about    dirhams to city centre for shopping     sterling  and are all very clean and all that we were in were brand new cars almost with leather seats definately will be returning here  and for much longer than   days next time   just book   you wont be disappointed     
P =>  Outstanding Service  Whilst booking our Honeymoon  we decided to stop off in Dubai for   days  amp  chose the Hilton Dubai Creek before reading any reviews  We were a little nervous about our choice after reading some of the mixed reviews on here  however  we shouldn t have been The hotel is excellent  The staff were extremely helpful  polite and attentive and actually seemed to enjoy chatting to you  rather than it just being a part of their job  The Concierge were very helpful  amp  informative and arranged afternoon tea for us at the Burj Al Arab  A truely awesome experience The bedroom was very spacious and comfortable  with floor to ceiling windows over looking the creek  The roof top pool was very welcome as a pleasent breeze drifted across to help cool you down from the    degree heat We didn t eat in Gordon Ramsey s Verre because it seemed extremely expensive  however the food in Glasshouse  which is prepared by his brigade  was excellent and a lot cheaper The only down side for me personally was the hotel bar  Although the service  amp  drinks were excellent  smoking was allowed in there and the extraction system didn t seem to work that well  be it is just me being used to the non smoking bars in the UK Overall  I wouldn t hesitate to recommend the Hilton Dubai Creek  It s location is great  not too far from anywhere  and the overall decor  amp  service is superb  
P =>   Great hotel choice in Dubai We were only visiting Dubai for   days and wanted a good base in which to do see as much as possible  The Hilton Dubai Creek reviews were excellent and we were not disappointed  The room was large and the bed very comfy and we had a view of the creek  which was nice  The bathroom was very large and clean with both bath and shower  The staff were very helpful and couldn t do enough to assist us with any queries  I had requested an early check in which was available when we arrived at   am  I did join the HiltonHonours reward scheme prior to booking  so it may be possible that they are more willing to accommodate members  It doesn t cost anything to join The pool on the roof is a welcome retreat after a days sightseeing in Dubai  with wonderful views out over the creek The hotel is about a    minute drive from the airport by taxi  There are also taxis available outside the hotel all day as it is not comfortable to walk anywhere in the heat  The taxi fares are very reasonable for getting around Dubai  During our stay we did a desert safari which I would recommend  these include  dune bashing in  x s  camel farm  camel rides  dinner  bellydancing etc  There are many tour companies which offer the same deals and all will pick up from the hotel  
P =>   Wonderful Place to Stay In Dubai I am writing this review because I can not believe some of the reviews I read before I went to the Hilton Dubai Creek  One review said that the hotel needed to be remodeled and updated  I think they are the ones that need to keep up with the times and maybe take a trip to Chicago  New York or LA to experience what is going on in the   st century  not all hotels need to be frumpy English cherry wood paneling  The Hilton Dubai Creek reminded me of the the  quot W quot  in Chicago  a sort of high style boutique look that is decidedly American  Minimalist modern in perfect contrast to the backdrop of skyscrapers outside the floor to ceiling windows  The service was excellent  the food was very good and the staff polite and attentive  I always stay at American hotels as they are the best in the world and I am American  this has been one of my nicest experiences and I am planning to make the Hilton Dubai Creek my home away from home  
P =>   Very nice hotel great service  We arrived at about  am after a very long journey from Canada to London  then onto Dubai  I had booked a room with   beds and was told that they were sold out and were only going to be able put us in a room with   bed  which I said was unnaceptable  I was upgraded to a suite which took care of the problem but I am sure my Diamond status helped things  The early checkin was appreciated This was the only glitch of the stay  the staff were some of the best I have experienced anywhere  Pool on the roof was fantastic  Dubai Creek is across the street  Concierge recommended Irish Village for beers and dinner one evening  it is worth the visit  The Executive lounge also offered a decent breakfast  and in the evening had one of the better lounge receptions with free drinks and finger food that I have seen in any Hilton I later stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah resort and although I wouldn t hesitate staying at the Dubai Creek again if there on business  I would definitely choose the Jumeirah location if travelling with my family  
P =>   Wonderful Stopover Close to the Old Town My teenage son and I stayed in this hotel on the way to Doha in Qatar for   nights  The personnel were really good  We arrived early at  am  I had asked for early check in but had said  am  didn t realise the Dubai airport would be so efficient   Anyway  the room wasn t quite ready so we partook of the excellent breakfast buffet and then to our room with views over the Dubai Creek All in all  the visit was lovely   the location is great and the staff are great  
P =>  Perfect for our weeks vacation Stayed for a weeks holiday at the Hilton Dubai Creek        to         Excellent hotel staff all very helpful  Lovely room overlooking the creek  Breakfast was included in our trip and was delicious and we didnt need to eat again all day after that   OK did try out room service once or twice which was excellent   Small roof top pool lovely and refreshing and fantastic views Gym good enough for when you are on holiday The hotel has a sister hotel on the Jumeirah Beach front and you can get a courtesy shuttle bus leaving at   am and returning at  pm  Make sure you book this via the concierge as it got busy  We spent a couple of days at The Hilton on the beach and it was excellent and worth the trip  Also you can use the courtesy bust to get you to the other side of town instead of catching a taxi as its about a    minute ride which otherwise youd get a taxi for  You are not obliged to catch it back so if your plans change thats fine The hotel is actually situated close to the creek and you can catch a small boat along the creek to the textile souks   about    each  and then you catch other boats over to the spice and gold souks  Its a    minute  rather hot  walk to the Dubai City Mall which is open until midnight and has a takeaway food area should you fancy something to eat but dont want to actulally go out for a meal as such  There are taxis readily available at the hotel Use the ones with the coloured roofs as they are cheaper than the other  quot luxury quot  ones and perfectly acceptable and reasonably priced  We went on a desert safari which included wadi bashing  driving a   wheel drive over the dunes   sand boarding  a very short camel ride  a barbeque  a belly dancer and some local clothes to dress up in  Good fun and Id recommend it Also try out Ski Dubai  which is in the Emirates shopping mall  It was about     dirhams for   hours       and you get the clothing and ski hire for that  Take your own hat and gloves as these are not provided Wild Wadi was a good fun day out too It is a water park situated in the shadow of the Burj al Arab The new Dubai Mall is a fantastic sight with an ice rink  a huge aquarium  fashion shows   musicians performing and a magnificent fountain diplay set to music  as at the Bellagio in Las Vegas   Every shop you can think of has a store there and I think its the largest mall in the world  right next to the largest building This hotel was in a perfect location for us as had we stayed on the beach theres a good chance we wouldnt have bothered to explore as much as we did It is only about    minutes drive from the airport so if you havent sorted out transpot a taxi ride shouldnt cost you much at all  No issues with airplane noise though which was good Fantastic time and Id definitely use this hotel again for a holiday It seemed to be used part business and part holidaymakers so the pool area is not usually too busyDubai is amazing Definitely go     
P =>   Window with a view that is surpassed by none My neice and I stayed because we had a    hour layover in Dubai on our way to Ghana  I can t say enough about the Hospitality of UAE Airlines and the Hotel Staff They really put most US airlines to shame by comparision We were really impressed that they had a room available within    minutes of our arriving in UAE and after a    hour flight from JFK it certainly was a pleasant surprise The first impression of the room is indescribable The main window is floor to ceiling and it better appreciated at night when all the city lights are on We were fortunate that the hotel arranged a city tour  One of those hop on hop off types that centainly was time much better served than sitting around thw hotel or striking out on your own It is obvious that there are many hotels in Dubai our choice was based strickly on Brand Name and Internet description  Very good choice     
P =>   One of Hilton s jewels in the Crown Just had   beautiful nights at this Hilton  Husband on business but we managed to enjoy the hotel in between his meetings organised at the hotel   very sensible  We have top status with HHonours so were upgraded to an enormous corner suite with floor to ceiling windows directly overlooking and with wide ranging views up and down the creek  Watching the dhows being loaded and unloaded was very entertaining  The bathroom was hidden behind double mirrored doors and revealed black white grey granite everywhere  including a large spa bath at one end and a sparkling glass shower at the other end  The huge and of course  amazingly comfortable bed faced the wall of windows and afforded amazing views at night  Very comfortable leather chairs and a top quality executive desk and chair completed the picture  The executive floor hospitality was excellent  very good food and abundant service of drinks  wine and beer included  It was revealing to choose seats directly above the perspex ceiling over Gordon Ramsey s  quot Verre quot  restaurant  Not much business going on in there  A   course meal started at     dirhams without any drinks  One couple sat alone for the whole of their meal  One evening we were told they only had eight covers during the whole night  In contrast  the Hilton  quot happy   hours quot  was pleasantly busy with a good ambience  The gym was of a reasonable size and well equipped enough  although probably geared more for male than female usage  Room service food was excellent with no disappointments  The hotel is in a good location  being close to the areas that tourists like to browse  A visit to the GoldLand building of the Gold Souk area proved particularly fruitful for my birthday  The temperature was high for the time of year at    degrees and you certainly don t feel like being outdoors for long periods of time  We have booked a further   nights at the end of  after our present   weeks in Europe  Can t wait  
P =>   Nice location Very good location  However indian food is not available  
P =>  Amazing experience  The rooftop pool is worth the price alone  The hotel doesn t look special from the outside  And it doesn t impress you much even when you enter the lobby  But the magic happens in the room and the rooftop pool I booked an executive plus room and it was spectacular  Great lighting  Comfy bed  Cool amenities  But the view made my day  I had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows  I could see the creek below and the dubai skyline right infront of me  It was a view to remember Specially at dawn  I swithed off all the lights  just sat on the floor near the windows and watched the natural color of the world around me change from black to orange and white  It was hypnotic and very soothing The toilet was ultra chic  Best of all it had a jacuzzi  After a long day of shopping you could just let the jacuzzi massage your body  By the end of the night  I felt I had got my money s worth  But I almost forgot the rooftop pool So the next morning I went to checkitout and the view just took my breath away  Plus the atmosphere was so cool  literally btw because it was raining that day   that you could just sit there for hours and let all your worries fly away I didn t have much time so I just sat there with my eyes closed for   minutes  And those   mins were some of the best moments I spent in dubai So if you ve the budget   go for this hotel  I booked in advance online and paid around      AED  night  Which is around       Also stayed at le meredian mina seyahi for around the same price  But if I had to choose I d choose this hotel hands down  
P =>  Lovely place lovely staff  On arriving at  am we were upgraded to a deluxe room and allowed in there and then  fantastic after a    hour flight from Melbourne  Stopped off for two days on the way back to Glasgow The room was massive and had floor to ceiling windows overlooking the creek  It was contemporary and the bathroom had a massive bath  bidet and a shower The staff were brilliant from the bellboy  concierge  reception to the guy who cleaned our room  They made us very welcome and feel special and wen t out their way to organise trips and taxis for us The hotel deserves its five stars and boasts a Gordon Ramsay restaurant  We ate in the other  less pricey one  and the food was stunning  A meal for two with soft drinks cost about    GBP which we felt was good value for Dubai It s in the creek area and a bit away from the bright lights and dazzle of the city  But we liked being a bit out the way and taxis are not too dear  Its also very convenient for the airport  which is only about    mins away The hotel had small swimming pool and a bar on the rooftop which offered a great view over the place and the Burj Dubai in the distance There are more luxurious hotels in Dubai but this one was down to earth yet elegant and the service was that of a five star deluxe  We paid over     GBP a night for a room and breakfast but  given prices for Dubai at that time of year  it was one of the cheaper five star properties  
P =>  Noisy plumbing mediocre service and food poor leisure facilities   stay elsewhere Stayed in Hilton Creek Dubai for   nights  Is in good central location  close to old city   incl  gold  amp  spice souqs   and creek  Difficult to sleep well  due to bizarre and noisy plumbing system  Can hear neighbours running water  can see the pipes through ventilation system  Breakfast and dinner in Glasshouse restaurant is mediocre  Some staff can be grumpy and downright nasty  Tiny roof top pool  also very small gym facility  A mosque is currently been build right next door  which means early morning prayer  Recommend to stay elsewhere  
P =>  Quality Hotel Stayed here for   nights on stopover to Maldives  Got a halfprice deal on Amazon so price worked out just under     GBP per night which is good for a hotel of this quality Room was spacious and had everything required  Hotel is beautifully laid out with a rooftop swimming pool if the need takes you  As I have an ancient Hilton honours card  we had the benefit of using the club and on a couple of nights exploited the generosity of the waiters when pouring out fine wines Never tried the Ramsay restauramt  but the breakfasts were quality  Bar downstairs was also good and excellent for watching sport  
P =>   Beautiful room  Surprisingly charming location  You cannot go wrong staying at this hotel  It was one of the best   star hotels we have experienced  If you like  quot old Dubai quot   creekside  as opposed to  quot new Dubai quot   the ultra luxury areas in Jumeirah about    kms  away   this is the place for you  The hotel was designed by Carlos Ott  so the interior is clean and minimalist  Ask for a creek view room  most rooms are   Definitely try the Gordon Ramsay restaurant  worth the extra price   Your location will overlook the Dhow wharf and will be   blocks from the abra crossing to the souk and historic area  catch the abra to the  quot old souk quot    There is a promenade along the creek that affords you a scenic walk  about   kilometres return   And  there is a shuttle bus to the Hilton on Jumeirah Beach    definitely leave time for this as the grounds of this beach hotel are remarkable  There is a spa and there are many good restaurants within walking distance  or across the creek by abra   cost is   dirham per person   Rooftop swimming pool and bar   small  but charming nevertheless  
P =>   Great Small Hotel This hotel is good  as the title says small  by Dubai standards   small bar area however very nice staff  nice atmosphere  nice bar food Rooms are large and have a wow factor the bathroom in particular Has the Gordon Ramsay restaurant suposed to be good never tried it also the glasshouse that is good value with good food The hotel has a good feel about the place  
P =>  Fab hotel My wife and I spent   nights at the Hilton on our way to Australia  it was by far the best Hotel we stayed in during our Trip to Dubai Perth Sydney Cairns Melbourne Singapore  the staff were helpful  pleasent and effecient  the breakfast was excellent and lunch at the rooftop pool bar was good  I used room service on a few occasions for Ice and it was at our door within   mins of ringing  the view from the bedroom floor to ceiling windows on the high floors is amazing  if we ever do the journey to Oz again with a stop over in Dubai this will be the first Hotel booked  
P =>   Go Executive What can I say  Superb  Friendly Staff  Check In Great  I booked via Opodo as they had    percent off rates in  Sale   an extra    percent off offered by Opodo if booking done before   st   And they actually refunded the     by the time I was back in UK I booked Hilton as a stop over for   nights on my way to India and travelled with my wife who was not disappointed with my choice of Hotel I read the reviews and chose to book the executive room which are located on  floors nearer the top The room had excellent views overlookin the creek and was in good shape with excellent bathroom Of course had bath robes and slippers provide Although Opodo won t tell you tranfers to and from are free when you book Exec  you just phone Hotel direct and speak to coincerage and they will pick you up and take you back to airport for free  Save        The check in  Well  we arrived at      am flying Emirates from Manchester to Dubai  Hotel picked us up  room was not due till     pm  We requested early check in  He said no problem  Asked us to go to Exec lounge for b fat     mins later  he comes in lounge to sya room is ready    Were in room by      am And we requested a late check out as flight to India was at night  again we got this extended to late afternoon Breakfast is included and you can use the Executive Lounge where you have free snacks most of the day and a happy hour in the evg where you can drink to your needs on the house  Drinks alone will save you a packet if you ahd to pay for them  And you can order b fast in room for free if you are not feeling to keep to the b fast times Course  it has Wi Fi in the lounge and a computer with online access that you can use for free  The staff at the exec lounge are friendly and become your friends just Tip them good and they will look after you Location is good and can pick up Taxi right outside the Hotel It has a pool on top which i looked at but did not use  A bar downstairs was visited by me on one night and it had a female  apparently Russian  sat on the stool smiling  but I am married so after a brief scan of the bar I relaxed in the area outside the bar absorbing the atmosphere Overall  I had a great experience here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of luxury  Of cousre they have a free transfer to the Hiton Jumeriah Beach whereyou can enjoy the beach etc  
P =>   Brusque and Efficient The hotel is good for two primary reasons  The view of the creek from the wall to wall window in the room and the central location  The service standards are better than most other hotels in Dubai but does efficiency have to go hand in hand with a brusque cold demeanour   The executive lounge has a very pleasant atmosphere and a German hostess with a warm smile  The loungue serves free alcohol and snacks from   to   pm  They do not serve good cocktails but recommend one sticks to wine or beer   The breakfast is ok but we discovered only on day three that one could order hot food at the table  They do not offer this voluntarily  The rooms need some rennovation but the bathrooms and toileteries  crabtree and evelyn  are good This hotel is primarily used by American and Europeans Just behind the Hotel is Al Riqa street    mins walk  with lots of interesting eateries  Would recommend Al Sadaf Iranian restaurant and Aran Iranian cafe which serves lovely shawarmas in Iranian bread for only ten dirhams  
P =>   Nice Modern Hotel   good location Hilton Dubai Creek is in a nice location away frommuch of the construction and near the  quot old quot  part of Dubai   the Creek area near  The pool on the roof is delightful  and the restaurant is excellent  The concierge arranged a nice Helicopter trip  All in all a perfect work hotel  
P =>   Happy New Year at the Hilton  I wasn t sure what to expect after having read some of the negative reviews on here  but we were there on New Years Eve and it was the best way to enter the New year We arrived at midnight at the airport where we were greeted by the driver of the Hilton car that was taking us to the hotel  We had booked the Executive plus room which turned out to be a huge beautiful corner room overlooking the Dubai creek  Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the doormen by our names which made me feel very welcome  Check in was quick and pleasant  Lobby is not too big but very modern with lots of glass and steel  It looked beautiful but not the kind of lobby you would sit in and have a drink in the afternoon because it feels a bit cold  We could use the executive lounge with free drinks and snacks in the late afternoon and I just loved that  We also had our breakfast there  It was not a very big breakfast but the qualitly of the juices and the bagles with salmon for example was great Since we were there on a short holiday    nights  we used their shuttlebus to take us to their sisterhotel at the beach  Very good service again  The room you have to see yourself to believe the views  Everywhere you look you see the lights of Dubai and that beautiful bathroom  We even had a jacuzzie  Housekeeping changed our towels at least two times a day and then there was the turndown service at night There were also a few things I didnt like  like the constant lounge music you here everywhere in the hotel  during breakfast  in the lobby  After a few days I just wanted to hear some normal music instead of that mindnumbing lounge music  And there was the bar that looked nice but I didnt like the atmosphere that much and it was expensive  The glasshouse restaurant is good  not great but nice enough to have dinner there as well I will go back in  but this time I booked the Hilton Jumeirah at the beach because that looked really nice as well  especially there nice big colourfull lobby  
P =>  Fabulous Hotel Hilton Dubai Creek UAE Wonderful Hotel  Sleek steel and glass modern interior and beautifully clean  Excellent service by very attentive staff who go the extra mile for you  Brilliant views from the rooftop pool  especially at night so take your camera  Pool is small but it serves its purpose  good clean showers and changing areas and a very nice poolside bar serving great cocktials and snacks  If you can treat yourelf  then please go to Gordon Ramsey s  VERRE  which is in the hotel  recpetion will book you a table The best eating experience we have ever had  Hotel bathroom is space age  Lots of glass  steel and marble  Excellent location and great value for money I will definately book here again  
P =>   Favorite Dubai Hotel This hotel is one of my Dubai favorites and I stay there almost every time I am in Dubai  The location is good for attractions in old Dubai and also if you are just there on a stopover as it is very close to the airport  Diera City Center  mall  is nearby so you can walk and avoid the Dubai Taxis  maybe the worst taxi drivers in the world   The rooms are nice and bathroom is great  If you like to relax with a hot bath at the end of the day  this is your place  Room service quality is great and restaurants in the hotel  including Verre by Gordon Ramsey  are great I am a frequent Hilton guest when traveling internationally  be they could give Hilton US some pointers  even though they are no longer the same company One thing for improvement  hotel staff are not aware of location  addresses  directions  etc  This is not unique to Hilton but has more to do with Dubai and the plane loads of expats that arrive each day to work and are given positions and little to no training  
P =>   Top of its class My wife and I have stay now   times at the Hilton Dubai Creek and have already booked for ruary and ust      If you can afford the extra Deluxe Creekside view which is utterly magical and has floor to ceiling windows on   sides  the extra is well worth it and you will not close your curtains for the length of your stay The decor in the main areas is reminiscent of a cruise liner with stainless steel  polished marble and wood The staff we found were very attentive to every need and would go out of their way to be both helpful and cheerful Dining in the hotel is first class and the menus I believe controlled by the celebrated English chef  Gordon Ramsey  and you can see his influence in the dishes in all the restaurants  In conclusion  I would recommend this hotel without question  
P =>   Went for the architecture was greeted by building work   We booked a stopover stay in Dubai we stayed for   nights before    nights in Thailand  Although we booked an Executive room we were only informed that we would receive a free pick up from the airport after we had been on a mystery tour to the hotel with a taxi driver who stopped for    minutes to ask for directions  Finally arriving at the Dubai Creek Hilton we were given a beautiful room over looking the harbour  The staff were lovely and gave us early check in and late check out  We were taken to the Jumeriah Beach Hilton at   am where we realised we should of booked to stay there if we wished to see some atmosphere  We enjoyed a Shisha        drinks from the pool bar and a short walk on the very hot beach    c   If your staying in a Hilton your best bet is an executive room the free drinks and service make up for the extra expense  We returned to Dubai Creek Hilton for evening drinks in the exec lounge where we were greeted by business men on laptops  Lucky for the attentive staff and a lovely French gentleman who lived in the Hilton when working in Dubai he was kind enough to advise where to go to for some night life  We spent the evening in the Irish Village  I was in the gym at      then on the roof for a swim before the sun was fully up  The sunrise and the views were amazing  Dubai is fabulous if you love the sun and staying in hotels  But the city where I was looking forward to seeing the fabulous architecture was coated in clouds of dust  A giant building site best seen from the plane  We pre booked with the Dubai reception for an airport collection to take us to Bangkok s Millenium Hilton but when we arrived there was no car waiting to collect us  It was a shame as this was the only part of the service which let us down The staff in the airport are so rude  I cant stand people dictating and shouting at the elderly and on our return to the UK the airport cannot accommodate so many people sprawled over the floor and there request for over     passengers to stand in single file when there were two cues baffling  
P =>  fits the bill perfectly   good hotel We stayed at this hotel for part of our honeymoon and  recognising that most reviewers only read the first sentence of any review we ll cut to the chase  it was very good For those still reading   The Hilton Dubai Creek is located on the busy Baniyas Road in the Deira district of Dubai but  despite this central location  feels relatively peaceful and almost serene  Like any hotel  it is to be judged by the quality of its staff and the employees at this place are excellent   always there with assistance  information or simply a greeting The hotel is located a    minute walk along the Creek from the centre of Deira and the popular Gold Souk  It s location on the motorway esque Baniyas Road makes it very easy to get to by taxi from anywhere else in Dubai  taxis being a very cheap and cheerful form of transport in what can be a relatively cash hungry destination Inside  the lobby promises much with its chrome littered walls and marble floors  The Issimo bar on the ground floor is a must for any resident who possesses even a passing interest in good cocktails  On the first floor is THE restaurant in Dubai   Gordon Ramsay s  Verre   We ate there during our stay and  frankly  cannot recommend it enough  whether you re staying at the hotel or not   A small and intimate place that is defined  firstly by the excellence of its staff  and secondly by the brilliance of the food  When we ate there the first choice to be made was between the incredibly tempting tasting menu and the extensive a la carte offerings  Either way  you ll have no regrets  Needless to say  before reserving your table  which we were told should be at least two weeks in advance  you should be ready to spend in excess of      for a meal for two with some decent wine  Whilst convalescing from open wallet surgery the next day you should head up the creek towards Deira and try the Creekside restaurant opposite the Radisson hotel  What a find   Mixed kebabs for two with hummus  drinks and a sheesha for about       all whilst sitting in the sun beside the water  The hidden gem for the Hilton is the roof top pool and bar  Cosy and intimate but with a quite magnificent view over the creek and upper Deira  On a clear night you can sit and enjoy your drink whilst surveying almost the entire city  all the way to the silhouettes of the skyscrapers on Sheik Zayed Road and the now legendary Burj Al Arab hotel  A lovely setting to watch the sun set or drop in for a drink or two before dinner The room was lovely  Just enough space to feel comfortable but not too much to encourage recklessness   It was clean  well appointed and nicely furnished  There is an extensive room service menu and all the usual amenities you would expect  decent in room toiletries  good safe  ample wardrobe space and TV with various UK channels  Our room was inclusive of breakfast which was served in the Glasshouse restaurant on the first floor  All the usual fare  fruit  cereals  croissants  bread   etc    plus a choice from a variety of cooked options  We loved the Eggs Benedict The reason for the rather protracted review is due to the number of negative reflections on this hotel on Trip Advisor  some of which concerned us greatly before we left the UK   Of course everyone can have a different experience of the same hotel but  having had an overwhelmingly positive one  we thought we should at least justify our view  We suppose that  if we re going to be pedantic  the potential negative could be price  Whilst the room tariff is reasonable  access to the internet is relatively expensive at approximately     for    hours  Having visited Thailand and The Maldives where such access is free this was bound to seem excessive but  in fairness  accords with other hotels in Dubai  On the same note  the drinks food could be regarded as moderately expensive  but again the prices are entirely in line with other hotels bars in Dubai  For example  expect to spend around         on two spirits with mixers and about       on a beer Overall  we wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel to fellow travellers as it properly markets itself as a busy  convenient  city based  large hotel with the service and standards you d expect from a  big name   To put it bluntly   it does exactly what it says on the tin  
P =>   Great Hotel We have been in the hotel on returning home from the Maldives during our honey moon This is a great hotel  The rooms are very large with many facilities  huge bathrooms and great views Professional stuff the meat all our needs and help us to arrange dinner in the famous aquarium restaurant of Burj al Arab The breakfast buffet was normal  Small pool in the roof of the hotel but amazing view from up there  In my opinion this is a great choice for those who want to stay nearest to the city  
P =>   Great Break Stayed in an executive room in the hotel which i would highly recommend to anyone  Some of the perks are you get picked up from the airport in the hotels Audi A  and taken back for your flight home  You must contact the hotel for this  The executive lounge is nice to relax in and includes free drinks and finger food snacks all day long  There is a happy hour from       to       for free alcohol  As we were there during Ramadan this was limited to an hour from        I believe the executive rooms are larger with better views over the creek The room was great and fairly spacious  Housekeeping every day and there is a turndown service at night which is good to come home to  Beds were comfy  Bathroom was big in my view and had a seperate tub and shower  or is failry modern but not over the top  Rooms have a well stocked mini bar and various english speaking tv channels Went to both restaurants at the hotel  Verre by Gordon Ramsay was a great experience and the food was excellent  A menu can be requested if you contact the hotel via email  To clear up any confusion  Gordon Ramsay has cooked there and has one of his chefs installed there  I didnt think the food was that expensive  although some of the vino was well priced  The glasshouse food was good also was more moderately priced  Could not complain about quality or service The service at the hotel was great  Concerige was very helpful and are able to organise anything for you  from taking you to a jewellers to arranging a safari trip Hotel is in a good location for the souks and is just a cheap taxi ride away from the beach and mall of emirates  There is a service that allows you to use the hilton jumeriah beach facillities  a bus takes you there at       and picks you up at        Journey is about      mins  We went to Wild Wadi water park and its a good day out  costs    dhms each for an adult so it isn t that cheap though  Also did a desert safari  again was great  You get picked up at       and arrive home at        Included in the price is an bbq and drinks  
P =>   Great hotel Great location Great place to be  The Dubai Creek Hilton is located right near the Dubai Creek with a beautiful view of Dubai  How much can I really say though  afterall  this is the Hilton  My only complaint is the charge of     Dirhams for internet access  One would think that a large business hotel such as this would just include access in the hotel fee  as most business travellers are going to want this  Still  this hotel is a great place and I am very happy I stayed  
P =>   Modern hotel with tough competition Under normal circumstances  the Hilton Dubai Creek would probably get a very high mark  The property appears to be quite new  the rooms are stylish  modern  bordering  quot design quot   clean  great views and good value for money But in Dubai competition is so tough with so many great hotels at good prices  the Hilton suddenly only becomes a good average choice Bottom line  good hotel in a central location  close to the airport  some limited noise   value for money  Chose this hotel if you are looking for a high class bed and don t care about the waiting list for some of the more stunning hotels  
P =>  Very poor service I visited the hotel for business In ust      and wanted to write a summary of my experience Good points   The  corner  rooms are excellent and have fantastic views over the Creek  These can be booked as the  plus  rooms  The lower you are however I would assume that the noise would be lounder as you re on a very musy main road  Well worth the extra     or so charged    The rooftop pool has cold wated pumped into it  and in the really hot months is a great place to relax  well  one of the only places    The bar is not too expensive     for a cocktail  and the views are great    Although small  the gym is very welcoming  has free weights and the changing areas fantastic    Verre  although there is little in the way of atmosphere in the restaurant  meat  fish eaters will like this  For vegetarians  the chioce is poor for the price  and I d recomment local restaurants  indian  lebanese     Free use of Hilton Jumeriah beach facilities with busses each day directly to the hotel    Comtemporary design   if you like glass  chrome and sleek furnishings  this hotel s for you  vs the more  traditional  Jumeriah beach Hilton  Poor   The service is appaling  There is a surface of a  can do  attitude  however beneath this they really don t care     The Executive Lounge is the worst I have ever been to  this offers unlimited snacks throughout the day and free alcohol from    pm  It s free for all Hhonord Diamond members  and you can pay a supplement for access when booking  to an Executive room   The  food  is rarely replaced and there is absolutely no food after  pm    not even crisps  snacks  and it s open until     pm    They re reasonably friendly in the Alcohol hour  but you have to be served  guess to cut down what s drunk   and after  pm they put the lights up and only have soft drinks  with the need to always ask for basics like ice etc     Utterly poor Lounge  and whilst you may get the financial return if you cram in a lot of drink in the    pm period  this is appaling for entertaining guests  clients     The management  any problem seems to take ages to be rectified  if at all      this is in stark contrast to other hotels in Dubai where they really appreciate that clients are paying a lot of money and have options where to go  OverallThis hotel is fine if you like design  and a good Creek view  over substance  If you can overlook poor service  an atrocious Executive Lounge with complett lack of service standards then consider it  The rooftop pool certainly is a big bonus for the location right in Deira  However  should anything go wrong or you expect a touch more personality then go to one of the beach resorts  or a  city  hotel on Sheikh Zayed road   where they value custom a lot more  This hotel seems to rely too much on its  designer name  and Hilton loyal customers who collect points  have the company paying  
P =>   Great for the price Hilton Dubai Creek is a must stay for early check in s  located   minutes from the Airport  overlooking the Creek  There is a small but spacious rooftop pool with bar service and spectacular views over the city At        return       there is a complimentary shuttle to Jumierah Hilton   where you may use the facilities for free The in house Gym is locate on the  st floor its small and limited  but serves it s purpose As you know Verre is located within the building  but I recommend leaving the hotel and going next door to the Twin Towers   where on the top floor you can have the most sumptuous Iranian buffet   go on a weekend where the selection is greater  Also the Diera City Centre   Mall  is   minutes drive away  Be warned  when the mall closes the queue for a cab is around    minutes  So you can walk it       KM  or leave earlierOtherwise a perfect city getaway 
P =>   Gives Hilton a Bad Name Just stayed for one night  so my impressions are quite limited  I would advise travellers to consider carefully before booking into this hotel Waited about    mins  at  pm in the afternoon  before being allowed to check in  Apparently there was a  manager s meeting   but who wants to wait in a lobby for so long after a long trip Housekeeping service is horrible  I waited for over   mins and had to call three times before an electrical adaptor finally arrived The decor is pretty weird  All chrome  glass and general darkness  Not exactly a warm and welcoming environment The broadband access is expensive     dms a day  if you don t include this in your room booking After such a bad experience  the  aren t we great  type of advertising throughout the hotel rings hollow  Basically the place is overpriced and understaffed  These guys need a lesson in good management  
P =>   Good location but poor service Overall my husband and I enjoyed staying at the Dubai Creek but there is room for improvement  The hotel is beautiful and the Gordon Ramsay Verre restaurant is conveniently located inside  We had a beautiful view of downtown Dubai  but we were on the  th floor which was too close to the busy street  The room was very nice  floor to ceiling windows  and the bathroom was fantastic  large bathtub and separate shower  The customer service needs to improve  No one helped us bring our bags in and we stood at the counter for a few minutes before we were attended to  I ve had better experiences in the Executive Lounge in other Hilton Hotels  Again the service was not up to par The location is great    you can walk everywhere from the hotel if you can bare the heat  
P =>   I love this hotel   A new executive club lounge has improved the overall experience at this hotel  The staff are keen  well informed and make a point of greeting guests by name Prices vary pretty wildly but the value for money is great   the rooms are spacious  with excellent facilities  and the Glasshouse restaurant offers good international cuisine  I ve never ventured into Verre  As well as being great for business travel they also cater for holidaymakers   although why anyone would choose Dubai for a holiday is beyond me   and there s a shuttle service down to their sister hotel at Jumeirah  
P =>   Great hotel   if you want real Dubai This is a great hotel  If you are looking for something near a beach with loads of activities  then it is not for you  But if you want a real taste of Dubai  then it is great  It is really close to the centre  souks  shopping centres  etc   We stayed there for   nights  We upgraded to a Executive Panoramic Plus room  It was well worth it as the view is amazing over the creek  The pool is small but clean and very useful  Staff was very friendly  We stayed during Ramadan  But food was served in one of the restaurants  Lunch and breakfast were both excellent  we didn t have dinner there   As part of our upgrade we had free private transfers  I only found out as I emailed to say we would be arriving late  So well worth contacting them in advance  
P =>   Travel Agent Loves The Hilton  My wife and I wanted to stay in the city this time in Dubai as we stayed on the beach last time  So we booked the Hilton and we loved it When we arrived they couldnt find our booking  as we arrived late I couldnt call my work  But this was no problem  they said its fine you check in to your room and we will call them tomorrow  We did and it was all sorted We got into the room and its just like the web site  All the rooms have Creek views and the bathrooms are very cool We where only Room Only but had room service  which was good value and very quick As this is a business hotel the pool and gym are not big but your not on holiday to work out  The pool is on the roof so you can see across Dubai and looks amazing at night  pool closed at  pm There are only about    or so sun beds so if the hotel is busy you better hope its full of business people or get up there early  But as I said its a business hotel so its what we expected There is a small shop there to get afew bits and bobs and bars etc but didnt really go in them to check them out Overall Id say its a very good hotel with large rooms and bathrooms  if you want to try stay on the Creek stay here You can also use the bus to go to other Hilton and use there pool etc  
P =>  Sunny Dubai The hotel was about       mins from the airport Me and my family had arrived from the airport about   in the morning  but had to wait till about   am before we were able to check in into our room  The room was fairly large and comfortable  and had a good view of the Dubai skyline and the nearby Dubai Creek  However  the breakfast buffet lacked a bit of variety  and is fairly expensive Dubai  in general  has relatively poor public transport  and traffic was bad from late afternoons till night  We had to move around in taxis  which can be fairly steep due to the bad traffic The Deira City Centre  the many shopping malls in Dubai  was about a    minute walk  if you fancy walking in the sun  mind you  it was    C in     An advantage is that  there is a shuttle bus from the hotel  in the morning  to the Hilton Jumeirah Resort  which is about a    minute drive away  Along the way  you can view the construction development that is ongoing in Dubai  including the impressive    m high Burj Dubai  soon to be the tallest structure in the world    Overall  the hotel is generally for business travellers  The hotel staff was  in general  very helpful For a family vacation  due to its locality  it may cost a bit to move around in a taxi  In addition  one may have difficulty finding food at night  
P =>  great stay great hotel We stayed for just over a week on business and holiday  whilst the hotel is mainly a business hotel it is still a good base for a holiday  Taxi s very cheap and always one there  Room was massive executive Queen  very clean and kept like that     times a day Breakfast was loverly  cold buffet and hot cooked to order  Strange you could order just about all the ingredients of a English b f but if you wanted all on same plate it cost   dhs  Ate room service by the pool on roof and once in room on last night very impressive low cost and very nice  Used the laundry service a few times took a few hours and very good and cheap The pool on roof is smallish but usable and the view is to die for Staff are great very very helpful from the manager downwards and if you get the chance of an invite to the managers cocktail evening go    food and cocktails lovely If you go for the executive room book an airport transfer all in with room rate and done very well  we walked out of arrivals      and went to the Hilton man who grabed our bags straight out to waiting limo and in hotel in minutes  Great service When we next go to Dubai we will be staying here again  
P =>   Great Room  shame about the Hot Water The ability to use the Penthouse suite for business meetings  meals and a cocktail party  does mean that you almost don t have to leave it  for the whole of your stay   which with the state of local traffic during the day is an added bonus   and means it s almost worth the money However  there was no hot water for the three days of my stay  which was almost inexcusable  This issue was almost offset though  by the efforts of the staff to remedy this  Particular mention to Mr Al Chikh  the Night Manager  and his Herculean efforts to resolve this rather important part of staying in a hot country    Notwithstanding  a good location for the Creek area  and airport  and subsequent visits have resolved the Hot water issue Not a tourist location then  but good for business  
P =>  Wonderful stop over hotel This hotel faces onto Dubai Creek so you get a great view of the harbour  It is very near the City Mall and the Airport  The rooms are superb  Also very good food in the restaurants  
P =>   OK Hotel   good view of creek My wife and I spent two days here in        The hotel is good  but not great  Check in out was about average  and service was OK but not teriffic  The room on the   th floor was average sized  King bed  comfortable   two chairs  small table  glass desk with comfortable chair  Floor to ceiling windows  nice in a corner room  with a great view of the creek  Very clean  If you like the modern style  you ll be in heaven  Lots of wood and glass  even the desk    quot Old quot  tube style TV with a good selection of channels and  naturally  lots of options  for a price   Given the decor  the hotel needs to update to flat screen LED or plasmas  Small bathroom with shower  no tub   OK  Not a lot close to the hotel  but no problems getting a taxi  The roof pool is small  but adequate  Good service at the bar  and a great view of Dubai  There are about    loungers with umbrellas  Ate in the lobby bar and room service  food was good and service acceptable   There is high speed and wireless internet available  for a price      dirhams  about     USD  a day      dirhams a week or      dirhams a month  Mini bar prices very high  Advertisements for hotel restaurants everywhere  even on the bathroom mirror    Overall  I rate the hotel as average  when compared to similar hotels   Nothing really negative  but nothing really grabs you either  No  quot WOW quot  factor  which you kind of expect in a    hotel in Dubai  
P => leaves a lot to be desired i have to say  i ve stayed at numerous hotels in the dubai area and hilton hotels from africa to middle east to the u s  and i am thoroughly disappointed with the quality of service at the hilton dubai creek  the hilton jumeriah hotel was much nicer and attentive to detail  the one at dubai creek leaves a lot to be desired  i called room service to remove a room service table  went out for   hrs  came back and the table was still there  called again  to have the table removed and only then did they remove it  obviously they forgot  same with turndown service  same with getting simple things like coffee at breakfast or towels when cleaning up the room  overall  the hotel needs some improvement  especially if it wants to live up to the expectation of the dubai crowd  i d almost prefer to stay at a hampton inn in suburbia usa  at least i know what to expect  at times i felt like the motel   was better service than this one  i know i will return to dubai for business and pleasure  i know for certain i will not stay at this hotel oh did i mention that when i booked the hotel online  it was at      AED  when i checked in  it jumped to      AED  i m a gold member and didn t get an upgrade  but i had to pay nearly     USD more for a mediocre room  got to say  loved the view of the busy intersection and parking lot from my room if you re a hilton fan  stay at the one in jumeriah  it s far better than this hole  better yet  stay at the madinat jumeriah  it s beautiful and the service is unbeatable  
P =>   Loved the Hilton Dubai Creek  We were in Dubai at the end of  stopping over for   days on the way to the Maldives We booked the Hilton Dubai Creek as we wanted to be in the city rather than the beach It was one of the nicest hotels we ve stayed in and we have travelled throughout the world  The only hotel to beat it was the AC Miramar in Barcelona The reception staff were really helpful and as we arrived at the Hilton at about  am our room wasn t ready  We went up to the pool and sunbathed until    and our room was ready The rooms were huge and had floor to ceiling windows on   sides  We had a lovely view of the creek and we were only in a normal room on the  th or  th floor Everything was spottless in the room and we were sad to check out Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice of things We had dinner in Verre too and it was nice  The staff are really friendly  I wouldn t go again as it felt a bit stuffy for us and there seemed to be a lot of people in there who were very loud about what car they owned and where they lived The pool was small but lovely and the staff up there were really nice and friendly  Drinks were resonable up there too  It is a sun trap though and the only shade was were you ate On our last day the hotel let us have a free late check out which was lovely as our flight wasn t until  am the next morning We ate at the JW riott Steakhouse and it was the best steak I ve eaten  We also ate at Radisson SAS in the Chinese and the dim sum was easily the best I ve had  We also had champagne afternoon tea at the Burj which was wwell worth it  I felt slightly sick after eating so much  We only went down to the beach this day for the Burj and to go to the Mall of the Emirates  The Souks were about a       minute walk from the Hilton but it was a lovely walk and there was so much going on we didn t feel it Cabs are cheap cheap and they are done on distance  not how long the journey takes so even if theres traffic its the same price Allow lots of time at the airport as there is lots of shops  We spent loads there All in all I would definitly stay at Hilton Dubai Creek again  We loved it  
P =>   Good Hotel good value  for Dubai   We had a good experience at this hotel  We booked via the hotel website and mentioned we were on our Honeymoon  No upgrade  but they did make swans out of our towels and sprinkle rose petals throughout the room The rooms were well sized and the facilities good  but it s probably due a refurb in a few years so the finish is looking a bit tired  particularly in the bathroom  Service was good at all times and the breakfast was excellent  Gordon Ramsay s restaurant is worth a visit if you re hankering for some European cuisine  make sure you re hungry though as the many complimentary dishes fill you up  Location wise  the hotel is very close to the airport  The free hotel mini bus to the Hilton beach resort takes around an hour The only real downside was the cost  which wasn t unique to this hotel  we visited Dubai as a stopover on the last two days of our Honeymoon  but failed to do any research regarding the price of hotels during the peak season Travelling from Malaysia where     Star hotels are available from      the Dubai Hilton was one of the cheapest luxury hotels at      per night  the beach hotels started at      No idea why Dubai should be more expensive than London  it s not that great a place Overall  a good hotel and good value for Dubai  
P =>   quiet western luxury How can you choose between the amazing collection of   star hotels in Dubai All the   star hotels in Dubai are luxurious  So is the Hilton All have beautifully furnished large bedrooms with state of the art bathrooms and separate showers  The Dubai creek certainly does  Indeed its bathrooms must be a housekeepers nightmare  All marble and chromium  Indeed given the lighting and mirrors if you are even a trifle overzsized  it might pay you to keep your eyes tight shut for a long before you sink into the overlarge tub All have excellent service  so does the Hilton  friendly and helpful  All are expensive  So unfortunately is the Hilton The only ay you can choose between them is to be clear about priorities  Given Dubais traffic problems your hotel should be close to where you have to be  The Dubai Hilton is on the creek mid way between Deira city and the yacht club    minutes by car from the airport plus or minus half an hour depending on the trafficDo you want a western or a more middle eastern style hotel  The Hilton is clearly a western hotel Do you want good food in your hotel  The Dubai creek has some of the best  It has two restaurants  Its main eatery  one Gordon Ramseys Verre serves perhaps the best western food in Dubai  The other  the Glasshouse Brasserie is in the style of a Mediterranean caf   again serving well thought out and presented food Do you want a large hotel or something small and more boutique style  The Dubai creek is small at least by Dubai standards  It only has    rooms  And a small up and down roof top pool rather than the massive lagoon style water features of some of the competition  The public spaces are all mirrors  glass and marble and nice and dark to cool the ambience in the sweltering heat  No tour groups that we could see and none of the badged from the courses and conference circuit Do you want a room with a view   The Hilton currently has great views from its riverside rooms  Of course given the rate at which construction gets going in Dubai  this might only be temporary  But enjoy it while you can  Do you want to be on the beach  No luck here  but the Hilton does have a twice a day shuttle service to its sister hotel on Jumeirah beach  
P =>   A real treat  We stayed at the Hilton Dubai Creek for   nights in ch to celebrate my   th birthday   we booked the executive plus room which made the stay even more of a pleasure  Firstly we were picked up in a limo from the airport  escourted straight through reception and up to the executive lounge on the  th floor where we checked in  The staff in the executive lounge are very helpful and friendly  they really added to our stay here  Our room wasn t ready at   am which is understandable  its normally free around  pm in hotels  but they offered us a breakfast in the lounge which consisted of smoked salmon bagels  freshly baked muffins  cheese  cappucinos  which was brilliant after a long flight  They then came over to us and said our room was ready   only   am  We were well impressed  We then made our way to the room which was amazing   the biggest room I have ever stayed in  on the corner of the building with floor to ceiling window walls  I could lie on the huge bed  which had been sprinkled with petals   and look out over Dubai  the view was tremendous  the best view I have ever had from my hotel bed  There was fresh fruit and water in the room and the bathroom was amazing too  Black marble everywhere  big walk in shower  huge double jacuzzi set in black marble  fluffy robes  slippers  oil burner  even a rubber duck by the bath  The toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn and there is also a CD player as well as the usual TV DVD  We ate at Gordon Ramsey s restaurant which was fabulous  great food  great service and not too pricey  We had   courses each  a nice bottle of plonk and the bill came to about      nowhere near as much I as I thought it would be  We ate the  nd night in the Glasshouse restaurant  Food was ok  service was pretty grotty  They right hand doesnt seem to know what the left hand is doing  We had to ask for butter   times to have with the bread  we asked for a bottle of wine  they said they didnt have that one  we asked for a different bottle of wine and they said they didnt have that one either    rd time lucky though  we got the wine  although we had to pour it ourselves most of the time  not a big problem  but just one of those little things   On our last day we were boarding the Costa Romantica ship for an   day cruise around the Emirates  Of course  we asked for an extended check out and they gave us until  pm  We couldn t get on the boat until  pm but it was no problem as we went down to the gym beauty salon area and there are   seperate identical to our room marble bathrooms with fluffy towels  robes  Crabtree and Evelyn so we spent the day by the pool after we had checked out at  pm and then freshened up in the gym bathrooms which are completely private and its all just for you  You lock the door and it is your own bathroom for as long as you need it  Speaking of spa  I had a wonderful   hours body treatment with a scrub and massage   at first they said the therapist wouldnt be able to do it  we had pre booked the treatment but once the hubby told them it was for my birthday they managed to get another therapist for me which was good  The pool is quite small  as everyone keeps saying  but its clean and warm and has the best views of Dubai  There are about    sunbeds so at certain times of the year it might be a bit of a struggle but in ch it was fine  The hotel seems to be full of business men  no kids running around which is great  If you book the executive plus room you get to use the executive lounge whenever you want  Throughout the day there is breakfast items  lunch and afternoon tea  all free and as much as you want  Also there are free drinks  beer  wine  spirits  between  pm and     pm which was great  We had an amazing time and would recommend a stay at this hotel strongly  Its conveniently situated for getting to the shopping malls and the open top bus trip is also worth doing as you can get on and off the bus all day  You also get a free river cruise thrown in which is brilliant  Conceriege will help you to book this  The jewellery and spice souks are good fun too  but a little mind blowing  There is a shuttle bus from the Dubai Creek to their sister hotel down by the beach  so if you want a beachy holiday then you can use that service  We decided to stay in the luxury of the Dubai Creek Hotel though and use their fantastic pool and executive lounge facilities  I can t rave about this hotel enough  
P =>   City Centre Chic A great alternative to Dubai s beach hotels  the Hilton offers a great location  We stay hear when travelling via Dubai to other beach locations and its ideally suited to explore the old city  The pool is a little small and there is limited sunbeds on the roof  but boy is the view good  Recommend a meal at Vere  Gordon Ramsey s signature restaurant   Book early  
P =>   Good for business I concur with most of the other reviewers  this is a fine business oriented hotel with excellent large rooms many facing the creek  I had an almost corner with lots of space  a pleasant view and superb all granite bathroom with separate two person shower  lovely deep granite surrounded bath  with obligatory scented oil candle burner at turndown  and was completely comfortable The staff  particularly the young ladies who run the Executive Lounge can t do enough for you  and everyone from the room boys to the waiters ran rings round each other to be helpful Breakfast is indeed a bit of an oddity  with a generous cold buffet but call order cooking for the hot items  some of which suffer in translation   but any minor errors were cheerfully rectified The small niggles are the unheated rooftop pool  very chilly in the current cold snap but probably cool all year round  and the rather small gym  Also you wouldn t really want to holiday here because this Hilton is not near the beach nor the popular shopping malls   this may be why I like its comparatively quiet and chav free atmosphere I ate one night at  quot Verre quot   the Gordon Ramsay branded a la carte restaurant and I have to say it was one of the most irritating and boring evenings I ve ever had in a restaurant Firstly  it s quite uncomortable   the tables are too close together and there s no view nor interest in the decor  not even great flowers or arrays of wine bottles  it s a pretty bland dull room  The French ified manager is so far up himself even Gordon would have a problem to slap some customer service out of him  and the mostly Indian waiters whilst charming have been drilled into formulaic  scripted service which saps the life out of the whole experience  and leaves you feeling exhausted and processed The presentation of food is fawning and beyond pretentious   quot  I present your pre starter starter quot    quot Did you enjoy your amuses bouches quot   indicated the number and incidence of the additional courses which mean you don t really need to order more than two or three from the menu because you could almost make your meal off the amuses bouches of pate  pastry straws and vegetable pure  the pre starter complimentary soup  the pre dessert dessert  a vile concoction of fruit and shaving foam which reminded me of the Lyons Maid  quot peach parfait quot  plastic cone ice creams we had at Saturday morning cinema when I was about ten   the petits fours and the complimentary chocolates Everything has four too many ingredients   and the humourless management won t permit any variation to the order  portion control is clearly king     when I suggested I might prefer more scallop and less pork belly in my oddly combined starter  the manager said  quot it s three pieces scallop and two of pork  take it or leave it quot      and I wish I d left it  The scallops were OK  but the caramelised pork belly roundels were greasy and nasty  and the pan fried watermelon  earplugs   because that s what they looked like  that accompanied it were downright laughable  I mean  who fries watermelon Fillet of beef was a small portion and a nice cut  and the menu listed the many accompaniments including caramelised salsify  celeriac puree  potatoes and madeira jus  When it arrived in a wobbling tower with a fried quail egg slimily perched on the top  I could cheerfully have thrown it across the room  Egg is such a popular allergy  why not mention its presence on the menu By the time I d worked my way through the inter courses to the chocolate and caramel semifreddo  I was bored beyond my capacity to enjoy the experience and just wanted to get out of the place  and breathe My fellow diners were mostly middle aged British couples too awed by Ramsay s TV fame and their opportunity to worship at the shrine to realise that this was over complicated food with pompous service which feels outdated and claustrophobic My summary for the Hilton  Sleep in  eat out  
P =>   Class and elegance We stayed in the Hilton Dubai Creek in mid       and early        and thoroughly loved both visits  In a city renowned for its glitz and OTT  quot glam quot   the Hilton Dubai Creek seems to be in its own category of pure class and elegance  The rooms are beautifully finished and furnished  One detail that I found particularly great was that I could not hear the noise from people in the hallway  This is probably due to the boutique size of the property  so that there aren t that many people walking past the rooms  the fact that the doors are very heavy and solid  and that the beds are placed in a position that minimises exposure to hallway noise  In uary  we flew from New York to the Emirates  It was a horrific flight  numerous families each with     ill mannered and LOUD children  that made me homicidal and suicidal  After a spa bath in the beautifully appointed bathroom overlooking Dubai Creek  I lay in the bed with exceptionally soft sheets  a soft down comforter  a soft down pillow  luxuriating in this slice of heaven  It was just what I needed  The staff are friendly  responsive and professional I found all of them to be extremely helpful  e g  I asked the operator for the phone number of Etihad Airways  She gave me two numbers  Neither worked and when I rang her back for further assistance  she was apologetic and immediately offered to find a couple of more numbers and told me that if these still did not work  to call her back  One of the four finally did work  but I was really impressed with her tenacity and willingness to make sure that I got what I needed  In a city filled with hotels and other establishments screaming louder and louder to be noticed  the Hilton Dubai Creek is the picture of refined grace  
P =>  over rated I think the main problem at this hotel is the lack of training for staff I stayed for   nights in late ember in Executive room  Despite being asked several times about my request for a non smoking room  I was assigned a smoking room in a  quot non smoking configuration quot   Given I was recovering from bronchitis  I was not impressed and asked to be assigned another room  There was apparently almost full occupancy   I was offered a  downgrade   and a similar  smoking room  This was also unacceptable  so I stayed where I was The exec rooms are OK   fantastic view   but configured rather strangely  lots of empty space  but so that the desk is jammed into a small space in one corner of the room   not great for working at  There was mineral water  but no complimentary fruit  The exec  lounge is ludicrously small for the number of executive rooms  over   floors   in the hotel I expect that in a    international hotel  the staff on the front desk will speak english  As a native english speaker  I experienced real problems a few times in making myself understood to the front desk staff  This is also unacceptable  While the staff were friendly  some clearly need more training in communicating in english Breakfast in the Glasshouse was a disappointment  The hot dishes need to be ordered  which is fine  However  after ordering the arabic breakfast  I received about half of the items that were advertised in the menu  and no hot dish  I was only told that the hot dish was  off  by the waitress after she brought my order to the table  not beforehand  Again  staff training seemed to be an issue The amenities at this hotel are also lacking for a    international hotel  The pool has an undeniably beautiful view  but there are no other facilities such as a steam room or a sauna  The gym is one of the smallest I ve seen for this standard of hotel In summary  I think you can do much better for a    hotel  While the location is good  this hotel seems content to rest on its laurels  
P =>   buisness orientated This Hilton is convinient for access to all downtown areas and taxirides to emirates mall   jumeirah beach are around       DiramsThe downtown location means there has to be a comprimise   thats in the size and location of the the pool Service was generally excellent   My only complaint was when I came to change over some money in the hotel   they said they where short of cash because of eid holidaysThey did not offer me any alternative location  The run of the mill banks wont change money for tourists  so you have to wait til you go to a mall and of course bring your passport Around this Hilton there is a shortage of any convienent shops e t c  on the doorstep almost everthing you do involves a taxiThe most helpfull people in the hotel are the porter taxis request people on the front doorif you are looking for lush garden settings this is not the hotel for you The rooms are nice with excellent bathrooms again the comprimis on that is the main room seems a little small for two people but great for one guy on a business trip 
P =>  Fabulous Stay Am a hhonors diamond but booked via a travel agent  Fabulous hotel  Was given a VIP checkin in executive lounge but we could not have access to the lounge because it seats only    and there are     rooms  Given a twin room almost at the front with lovely views over the creek  Free mineral water and fruit  The bathroom was covered in granite with a lovely large shower  plenty of towels and robes and the usual La Source toiletries  A little oil aromatherapy burner was lit at turndown every night  Room was spotless  lovely bedding and excellent air con Cocktails in issima bar were    to    dirhams ie    to    and the staff were very warm and helpful  The breakfast was good  The usual continental and additional Arabic and English items cooked to order  It was included in our rate otherwise    dirhams for continental or    for Arabic English  On an inclusive rate you can also take breakfast in the room  The Glasshouse restaurant had very good food and on Mondays and Wednesdays when you eat   courses you can have house wines  beers and spirits for   dirham each The Gordon Ramsey restaurant Verre was incredible    oddities  the wannabe wags at the next table smoked through the meal and the house champagne was poured from a decanter   Cheapest wines are about     a bottle and the house champagne is     a glass   We had the   course Prestige Tasting menu at     aed  about      each and it was sublime  Every course was beautifully prepared and the service was excellent  The maitre d  was absolutely charming  The cheeses were incredible and the lobster risotto deserve a special mention  You do need to book ahead but for a truly memorable experience  it doesn t get any better The rooftop pool was very pleasant though small  The massages we had were not great   Next to the gym with the door being knocked and no music just the whirring of the treadmills  Skip these  A soft cd and aromatherapy burner could improve things a bit Staff were helpful and friendly and I would return at any time  Also did the afternoon tea at the Burj which was fabulous Excellent stay  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel  My wife and I stayed here for   nights in early ember  We loved this hotel  The staff was great and the location couldn t be any better  We flew in from Zurich and arrived at   pm  Check in was quick and they upgraded our room upon arrival  We ate at the Glasshouse Restaurant the  st night and it was great  The service was efficient and the waiter even had a free dessert sent out to us  We took a taxi to the Gold and Spice Souk and then walked back along the Creek  It was a beautiful night and it took about    minutes to walk from the souk back to the hotel  The pool is small but the view made up for it  The pool overlooks the creek and had a fantastic view of the Burj Dubai  When we were there they had completed     stories  It just towers above the skyline  Our room had floor to ceiling windows with a view of the city  The room was spacious and comfortable  We would definately go back to the Hilton Creek  After   nights here  we spent   nights at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach  Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a good city experience and central location  The hotel is approximately   minutes from the airport and    minutes from Jumeirah Beach  I can t say enough good things about the Hilton Dubai Creek  
P =>   Great Location This was the  nd trip to Dubai  this  st time we stayed at a beach hotel but this time we thought we would stay on the creek  I only wish we booked for longer The hotel itself over looks dubai creek  this is a really nice walk  Its about    min walk to the gold souks and spice souks  The rooms are what you would expect from the Hilton  very large rooms and very sexy bathrooms  The hotel rooms have floor to ceiling windows so you can look across the creek  Every room has a creek view so dont worry on that one We booked room only so did not have breakfast but did have room service a few times and the food was very good   so good I eat the same thing three times Everything in the hotel is modern and clean  The staff are very friendly and helpful  The pool is on the roof so you get a great view across Dubai  I would say go swimming at night  the pool is very quite and the views are amazing  On the down side of the pool it is small  with only afew sun beds  but the hotel is a business hotel Overall I would stay here again  Very central and very good standard  
P => Great location and hotel Good hotel  wasnt dissapointed with anything  other than the pool was a little small and got crowded We upgraded to an exec corner room on the   th floor  and the views were fantastic  two complete sides of the room floor to ceiling windows  where we could see the city hotels  and the Beach hotels People were great  nothing too much trouble  and we walked along the creek down to the Souks  which were also fun  Walking to the SAS Radisoon gave us a good selection of places to eat  and one of our best meals was the Indian restuarant in the Sheraton hotel just across the way  they had recently won a couple of awards The local shopping center  Diera  I thought was the best  as it was more local and I think a little cheaper and less crowded than the main Mellenium shopping center For us the location worked  as we caught an open top bus  taxis were cheap  and nothing was that far  we did catch the shuttle and or taxi to the Hilton Beach hotel  but it was nice to get back to the quieter and calmer dubai creek  You can get towels and use the showers etc at the beach hotel no problems To say the beach area is a giant construction site  is an understatment  they teckon a third of the worlds cranes are in dubai  and most of those are in the beach areas  so I am glad we stayed slightly out further Also free transport to and from airport  
P =>  Very Welcoming We arrived on the morning flight  as we had booked the executive room  transfers from and to the airport were included  but needs to be arranged with Concierge  We arrived at the Hotel about  am and was escorted directly to the Exceutive Floor for checking in  Our host gave us some refreshments and advised us that checking in is at  pm  but will have the room ready for us by   am  and they did  We stayed on the   th Floor with amazing views over the Creek  As we stayed during Ramadan the Friday Brunch was not available  however they let us choose from the A La Carte Menu and we was not disapointed with the local fish  Hammer  and thanked the Chef in the Glasshouse for his delicious food  At the Issimo Bar the staff were great and kept us entertained with their different cocktails in the evening  The only thing I was disapointed in was the breakfast  we had an hour left of breakfast being served    staff took our choice  or so we thought  one breakfast turned up and the other didn t  and had to be re ordered  thus making us late for the FREE bus to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  so we went snowboarding instead    now that s another story and not linked for a reveiw on this Hotel  Recommend the Executive Rooms facing the Creek  
P =>  This hotel has it all   ALMOST I just recently spent a week s stay in Dubai split betwen this property and the Hilton at the beach  As with any stay of more than a day  you discover the good and the bad and this trip was no different First the good  The hotel is incredibly convenient to walk along the Creek  catch a cab to the Souks  visit the mall  or just gaze over the water all day long  You truly can not beat this location to see what the real Dubai looks like and since its in Deira  there isn t that much construction going on around  I stayed in an executive room on the   th floor that was very modern and big  There were two easy chairs  a small table  L shaped writing desk and massive bed  The best thing about this room though has to be the bathroom  Huge soaking tub  black marble all over  separate shower   just so nice I could have lived in there  We ate in Gordon Ramsey s restaurant the first night as the drink special on offer at the Glass House packed the place  The food was absolutely incredible but then so was the price      AED for    with very little wine  The lobby bar is very cool and we had pre dinner or post dinner drinks here every night  I could have lived in here too  The staff are great in true Hilton fashion and the lobby area is stunning Now the bad  Although offering one of the better views in this part of town  the pool is a big jacuzzi with only about    loungers  During Ramadan there are curtains up and you have to eat and drink behind them  It was too crowded on one day to even find a seat and almost too hot the other days  The executive lounge is just as bad   I think there are seats for    with the top   floors offering executive rooms   you do the math  The last night we were there we sat at the executive check in desk and had a drink since there were no spots  They do have a computer  that was almost always occupied  that was free for checking email and such but if you wanted to use your own you had to pay the rediculous cost of     AED per day or     AED for the week  Mind you this is in a room that cost      a night  There was maintenance of some sort being done on the right side staircase from the lobby which was very loud during the day to the point that I found it hard to have a meeting All in all  a great place but if I stay downtown  I ll stay at the riott and only come over here for a drink or two  
P =>   Modern City Hotel with the WOW factor My wife and I stayed for two nights before going on to the Hilton Jumeirah  To which the concierge organised free transport   This is a new boutique style Hotel with a very modern feel  The service is exactly what you would expect of a   star hotel with well trained and friendly staff  Gorden Ramsey s restaurant on site is more expensive than the normal but worth the extra  The rooftop swimming pool is small but very good Traveller s tip for business travellersIf you book an executive room  not much extra in cost  you get picked up by limo at the airport  checked in at the executive lounge which is open to you for breakfast  although we were given the choice of eating the very good breakfast in the restaurant for free  and all day for snacks with free alcoholic drinks from       to        Some consider this to be the equivalent of  quot All Inclusive quot   Internet access is also free  
P =>   Avoid this Hotel We checked in  around  Pm the Hotel building is new the reception are is some how small and dull not lighted Enough I geuss  we were given room      The room is near the elevetor which turned to be very disadvantage as it gets very noisy in the morning espicially when families with children are waiting for the elevator reception service was very efficient and quite good house keeping was fast but the guy is so rude that he knocked our door early moarning asking us what time are you going to check ou today then when we were leaving the room he went inside immidiatly to check the room avoid rooms ending    and    beacuse there is no bath tub as well after we checked out I came to know that only rooms at the corner no bath tub  the looby bar was very quite so we had to leave for outside fun the breakfast resturant system is so starnge you have to choose either English buffet or Arabic and the price is different  I never saw that system anywhere  room service was tasty and good and it s cheaper 
P =>   Excellent     The service was fantastic from arrival to departure  The hotel is stunningly beautiful  the staff very warm and friendly  service spectacular  food excellent and rooms very comfortable  We drove there and anytime that I needed the car it was at the door in the time it took me to hang up the phone and take the elevator down  Everyone remembers who you are so you do not even need to ask for anything because they already know what you will want  We stayed on the executive floors and the staff could not have done anything more to make us feel welcome and at home  
P =>   what to expect more  they could not do more to make me feel a special and important guest  i was coming from an intercontineltal night flight and arrived at hilton dubai creek at      am  yes  in the morning   at the reception the staff told me that they could not check me in immediately and were so sorry  i was very tired so i told them i would have waited and asked where i could have breakfast  suddenly came the responsible and offered me a complimentary breakfast at executive lounge  i didn t have a reservation for an executive room and i m just blue hhonors  after the breakfast the staff told me that the room was ready       a m       they also upgraded my reservation to deluxe plus room  and were kind and useful in every moment of my staying  i also appreciated very much the big and confortable room  the hotel has a very good location close to the creek and   min by taxi to and from the airport  about    dirham from the airport and    to the airport   the pool is nice but a bit small  the view from the pool and from the room is fantastic 
P =>   excellent my fiance and I stayed in this hotel for   days before we headed on to the maldives  we had an executive suite which was stylish  great views of the city  floor to ceiling windows around   walls  the staff were great and always friendly and wanting to chat  issamo bar was chilled and did great cocktails  We ate in the gordon ramsy restaurant verre and the food was gorgeous  Bonus having a roof top pool   you could see for miles  perfect location as your in the middle of everything would recommend this hotel to anyone  we had an amazing time and would defo go back   defo worth the money  
P =>   Fantastic Experience We stopped over at the Hilton Dubai Creek on our way to our honeymoon in Maldives and it was the perfect start to our holiday  Fantastic modern rooms  especially on the Executive level   great breakfast and restaurants on site Location is excellent for exploring the more traditional side of Dubai such as the gold and spice souks  The hotel also has a complimentary shuttle service to their beach hotel which takes about    minutes  avoid during peak traffic times  Would definitely return here  
P =>  Excellent Hotel  We decided to stay here as an extension to our honeymoon on the way back from the Seychelles  It is about    minutes away from the airport but you cant hear any airport noise from the hotel  We got upgraded to an executive room which was lovely  The room had everything you needed  very stylish  clean and spacious too  The roof top terrace pool and bar has amazing views over the city  and opens late  It s a great way to cool down after a full day exploring  It never really gets very busy either  It is the perfect hotel if you want to explore the city centre  but if you want a beach holiday  stay at Jumeirah beach   It is close to the souks  overlooks the river  where you can get a river boat which costs about   p to get across  and a taxi ride to most places within in the city costs less than        Taxis are the best way to get around the city  Its definitely worth booking a desert safari with the concierge  the car picks you up from the hotel and a half day trip costs about         The hotel has a Gordon Ramsey restaurant which is fantastic  delicious food and slick service but a fraction of the cost of the London ones  The tasting menu is huge  each course is the size of a main meal  Most women in the city centre are conservatively dressed i e  women don t wear shorts  and usually have their shoulders covered  and it is recommended tourists do that too  
P =>   Not tacky not overated just perfect I loved this hotel   its not on the beach  thank god  its not full of screaming kids and families on holiday  it has style and substance  Groovy lobby bar  excellent Friday bruch  chilled out rooftop pool with excellent views  slick chic rooms  and Great staff  I loved the location but there is a free shuttle to the Hilton Jumeriah Beach  and once you go there you will be glad you didn t stay there  Thank you for a wonderful experience  i have been a travel agent with Amex for    years and I ve never been treated so well or had such a fab room  alright its not over the top deluxe but its perfect in every other aspect  check out the sexy bathroom with candles lit in the bath and a huge shower and cool toiletries  On my birthday I had two dessserts delivered to my room and a bottle of wine comp of the hotel manager  no where i have stayed before provided this level of service  I ll be back when i can afford it  Lovin it please keep up the good work and show these tacky overated overpriced hotels that smaller is better  
P =>   Very Welcome My first trip to Dubai  and for only one night on business so the hotel had to be good  For a few pounds more I stayed on the executive floor  I arrived at     am and had to wait for   hours for my room  since check in wasn t until after midday this was OK and the staff did all they could to make me feel welcome and accomodate me after a long flight  Room was spacious and airy  great bathroom with very deep bath  and seperate shower you could kick a ball in  Huge bed  and all the facilities for a business trip you could want and more  Room rate  Even including local taxes  was excellent and staff were always prompt  polite  and attentive without being intrusive  Unless I am going on holiday this will be my preferred stay in Dubai on future visits  
P =>  Great Hotel Very nice and clean hotel that s abot    minutes from the airport  Great service and good food  Nice rooftop pool  This hotel has everything at a good price  Would definitely stay here again  
P =>  In the land of seven star hotels this provides eight star service I have stayed in The Hilton Creek for the past five years  three times a year  Service has always been first class  With Gordon Ramseys Verre Restaurant within the hotel  dinning excellence is expected throughout  Located in Deria it is away from the popular Jumeriah area however taxis are cheap in comparrision to home  UK  It would cost approx    US dollars to get from Deria to The Burj Al Arab The hotel is locate a short distance from the old Gold souk All the rooms have internet connection and most seem to have a fax printer in the room as well Only concern is if you are exhibiting at the trade center the journey back to the hotel could take    mins  Small and friendly hotel unlike the other large corporates you become a name here not a room number  
P =>   Good location to explore Dubai Our party consisted of two adults and a    year old child We found the room to be large and pleasant The foyer is impressive Verre restaurant is excellent The hotel appears to be more for the business market  however we enjoyed the location as it allowed us to explore Dubai and get a feel for the history of the country The roof top pool is small and not easy to get to  however the views from the pool are stunning  
P =>  Fantastic Hotel Stayed for two nights just before the Easter Bank Holiday Weekend  Got a corner room which was huge  The bathroom was fab with a jacuzzi bath  Both restuarants were excellent  one is Verre by Gordon Ramsey  Beautiful roof top pool on the   th floor offering spectacular views over Dubai  Excellent Hotel 
P => Great hotel all around Stayed here for two days for leisure  before heading to Fujairah  It is located quite centrally to the Dubai attractions and airport but is a little far from the beaches   the free shuttle will take you to the Hilton beach resort in       minutes  We really enjoyed our stay in one of the Executive corner rooms  which include executive lounge and airport transfers The airport transfer left a bit to be desired as the driver wasn t there when we got through customs  Nice car though  We did a very early check in which wasn t much of a problem  We had to wait about    minutes for our room but were invited to use the Executive lounge where we had breakfast  The lounge is quite small but they do serve decent food  unlike most Hilton executive lounges  There s also free wifi internet there The executive room was very spacious and everything was immaculate  Nice views of the creek through the floor to ceiling windows  Real feel of luxury  especially in the beautiful bathroom with separate shower  Great amenities with fancy coffee maker  printer  plug to charge the laptop while stored in the safe  and Hilton rubber ducky in the bathroom  There s enough space to share with a third person  child or small adult  with a roll away bed Breakfast in the restaurant was perfect  with everything we could want for breakfast  We were very pleasantly surprised by the variety and quality of each item ent pool on the rooftop with loungers  Parking was free  but a little tight to navigate a full size SUV The only thing I could fault was that staff members at checkin and lounge were very cold   something we noticed throughout the UAE   however they were very professional  Overall this is a very nice Hilton that s a cut above the others in the chain  It should be commended for it s attention to detail and the pervasive sense of quality throughout the property  Recommended if you re here for a stopover or to sample the cultural and shopping attractions  
P =>   fantastic hotel stayed at hilton for   nights in executive room  hotel very clean all the staff we very helpfull and polite  rooms were great very big massive bed  executive lounge a little small but never got full  free alcholic drinks     every night in lounge  glasshouse food was very good  verre very nice food but the atmosphere was lacking had a great time would stay at this hotel again great location for souks  saving to go again  
P =>   Great Rooms Good Food We stayed here for my birthday back in ember  and we were upgraded to a club floor corner room with our Hilton status  The room was HUGE    the corner room was wonderful  Had a mini bar  comfortable bed  nice leather chairs  and very well put together  My favorite part was the full jacuzzi hot tub in the bathroom that overlooked the city  We ate at the a la carte restaurant and the food was wonderful  I highly recommend it  The martini bar was small  and not the best of drinks  but service was great It was too cold to swim  but the top floor pool was nice and also had a great view of the city If you are staying in Dubai for business  or for a short holiday  without wanting to stay by the beach   this is the perfect hotel for you  Location is great  near many other great hotels and restaurants  and ten minutes from the high fashion Burjamon mall  Warning though that the traffic in this area is horrible in the evenings  so be prepared  
P =>   The mediocre Dubai Hilton Overall I have given the Hilton a score of   out of     the reason for this is the quality of the hotel against the other   hotels we stayed in during our holiday   The Jumerah Beach Hotel and the Fairmont that we leagues apart I can see why travellers say that the Hilton Dubai Creek is the best city  Deira hotel    quite simply it probably is   although though there is little real competition along the Creek  I visited Dubai    years ago and the creek was a happening place   then we stayed at the old Intercontinenal   however nowadays all the action is either at the ina  Jumerah Beach or Sheik Zayed Road  The best thing about the Creek is the fact that it is near the Gold Souk   the worst thing is that its quite a run down area and the traffic to get back across the Creek is mind numbing Ok so onto the Hotel itself  The hotel is quite small and a business hotel   not a place for families  The rooms are generously sized and the bathrooms nice black marble   very smart  All rooms face the Creek  ours did sort of  and there is a small roof top pool  see picture   warning get there early to find a space     Lots of European business travallers staying at this hotel and the front desk team were capable of speaking many languages  So why isnt this a   star hotel  Well its the little things that stand   stars apart  For example no one was available to hail you a taxi out the front of the hotel   or no one was there to open the front door for you when you arrived with your shopping  Small things I know  but something you would expect at a top class hotel Didnt eat at the Verre Restaurant  Dont like frogs legs   the menu didnt look as expensive as I thought it may have been    although it was always busy of dinner  Room service was good and we ate in the Glasshouse restaurant that was ok as well Finally I would like to mention the Hilton Jumerah Beach  The Creek s sister hotel  that we visited on the daliy bus trip  I have enclosed a picture of the magnitude of the building work in the marina which simply dwarfs the hotel  Despite the ina being  quot nearly completed quot  the background hammering  welding and clanking would have driven me made if I stayed at this hotel more than a couple of hours longer   the same must go for the Oasis Beach which was next door or the magnificent looking Grosnevor Hotel that was just up the road  This is a personal thing   but you have been warned     
P =>   Nice Hotel but stay nearer the beach  Stayed here in tember for   nights on holiday  I not sure if this hotel was originally just and empty building which Hilton took on because although its stylish it definitely have a look of an office block  Because I am Gold Hilton member I was immediately upgraded to a nice room with floor to ceiling windows on two sides with a good view of the Creek  The down side of the upgrade we was that we was not allowed to use the Executive Lounge and to be honest it was so small and crowed we didn t miss much  I wasn t too happy on how I was told I wasn t welcome in the lounge  the lady on the desk was quite abrupt and unpleasant when all she needed to do was to explain the situation in a professional and polite manner    out of    for customer service in the lounge   The pool on the roof is very pleasant with good views over the city  it has a small bar area and food can be ordered although  the shaded seating area is a little on the small side but the bar pool attendant couldn t do enough for you and always with a smile  We ate once at the Gordon Ramsey Restaurant   Le Vere which was superb and very reasonably priced much better value than the Al Mahara at the Burj Al Arab  we ate there as a celebration meal for our wedding anniversary and although the food was good it was very very expensive  In would definitely recommend Le Vere  even if you are not staying at the Hilton but book well in advance and make sure you leave plenty of time to arrive  the traffic between  pm and  pm in Dubai Derail is absolutely horrendous  Don t bother with the bar it has no life at all  this is primarily a business hotel and the bar was empty on every occasion we passed  The room service menu is good with a very efficient service  Breakfast is OK nothing special The problem with this hotel is its location  Dubai city itself has not got a great deal to offer and if you venture to the Gold Souk beware that Taxi drivers are unwilling to take you back because its just a short distance  to far to walk though and imposable in the heat and humidity   The guidebooks tell you that the Taxi drivers are not allowed to refuse a fare but they keep the doors locked and ask were you are going before they let you in  then say they don t understand English and drive off  We eventually got a taxi but the driver said he had no change so the fare was not what I expected to pay  Overall the Taxi fares are reasonable and they are definitely the best way to travel One good experience we had at this hotel was because of my Gold status we got complementary transport to the airport on our departure in I a very nice car     out of    for customer service this time  I would not      recommended this hotel if you are on holiday  it s a good business hotel and I would stay again if on business in Dubai  The hotel runs a shuttle service to its sister hotel on Jeremiah beach which is       minutes away  could double during rush hour  my advice would be stay at the beach it has more to offer and travel in to Dubai City if you want to  
P =>   Dubai s finest  city hotel  Arriving in the heat of Summer  the Hilton Dubai Creek was a welcome respite  Our room was superb   very large for a standard room and the black marble bathrooms are very luxurious  The entire atmosphere of the hotel is unlike any other Hilton I have stayed at   it is like a boutique hotel  The staff service is excellent  and although it is quite tall  it is actually a fairly small hotel  The rooftop pool is just great  We stayed in a standard room  however some people we were with had a massive suite  I believe it was an executive club suite  and it was amazing  It had its own bar  cappucino machine  two bathrooms and enormous wrap around balcony  Breakfast here is extremely good   a buffet of cold foods and a menu  my god  a breakfast MENU   to order your substantial hot food which comes out looking like something from an extremely exclusive restaurant Anyway  bottom line is  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough  It s fantastic  Obviously it s a city hotel so it s not on the beach  but if you don t want to be in a resort then this is the hotel for you  
P =>   LOVED IT  Had eaten at Glasshouse a couple of times on previous visits and always liked the look of this hotel  So when my friend and I decided to come for a weekend shopping trip from Pakistan where we live at the moment  it was my first choice  We got a free pick up from the airport and the driver was waiting with my name on a board  We checked in at the Executive lounge and had tea and smoked salmon sandwiches whilst the receptionist went through the formalities  We had asked for a twin room which wasn t available on the Executive floor so we were given a room on a lower floor but still had access to the Executive lounge  The room was lovely  twin beds facing a wall of glass looking down the creek and out to sea in the distance  The bathroom was gorgeous   a big bath  huge separate shower  all in black and grey marble and granite and a complimentary rubber duck  Our room was very quiet and the beds were comfy so we got a good nights sleep following our mega shopping trips  The location is good   City Centre mall is a short taxi ride away  walkable at a pinch  and M amp S  Toys R Us  Reef Mall  Al Ghurain mall and the gold souk are all pretty close as well  On all but one occasion we managed to get a taxi almost straight away outside the hotel  although the odd driver would refuse to take us when he realised we weren t going far   one pretended he didn t know where the gold souk was  The hotel also has a complimentary shuttle bus to a different shopping mall once each day  Breakfast was served in Glasshouse and was very good   hot dishes such as bacon and eggs  french toast  pancakes  eggs benedict etc are ordered a la carte and served directly to you  We had dinner in the Glasshouse one night and as ever it was excellent  The executive lounge serves tea  coffee  cold drinks and snacks all day and from   to  pm has  quot happy hour quot  with wine  spirits and beer plus hot snacks  houmus  cheeses  etc  Only complaint is it is very small and gets busy at happy hour so you have to get there early to get a seat  Staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful and housekeeping replenish towels and toiletries in the evening when they do the turn down service  I really couldn t fault this hotel  it was a fab experience from the moment we were picked up at the airport to being dropped off there again   nights later  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel in an amazing city We stayed   nights in this hotel and can t fault it  We were checked into our room immediately  even though we had arrived early following an overnight flight  The room was superb  looking out over the creek and offering every luxury you could require We used the glasshouse restaurant for breakfast and dinner  all meals were fresh and delicious and served by excellent waiting staff  Room service was also quick and very reasonably priced Housekeeping were also excellent  whenever you requested anything  it was brought to your room immediately The hotel also arranged trips and offered advice on places to visit  taxi s etc  We used the business suite and pool on many occassions A trip not to missed is the Desert safari  we used Sunflower tours and the trip was amazing  We also used the Big Red Bus tours to visit the beach area and spot all the city sites  This ticket also included a cruise on the creek and was exceptional value Both Dubai and the Hilton were fantastic  
P => Perfect Location away from building sites We had done a great deal of research on this hotel and we were not disappointed  The location is beside the Creek  which is well away from all of the building sites which are going on in Dubai at the moment The rooms are lovely  with fantastic views of the Creek  The staff are very helpful  especially the Concierge  The food and drinks are very pricey  We got caught out the very first morning as we thought we had booked bed abd breakfast  but we had only booked bed  We only fancied coffee and cereal which we had  When we came to leave the restaurant we had to  quot sign quot  for it and then we realiesed we had charge it to our room  AED     which is about       which is when we found out we had to pay for it  Just a word of warning        The gym is very good  small but lots of equpment in  the roof top pool is small  but perfectly adequete and the staff in both are very helpful If you are planning any trips don t use something different com which the local operator is Planet Tours  They messed us about telling us different pick up times  and then when we phoned to confirm our second tour they said they could not find our booking  so we booked through the hotel and then an hour before we received a fax from planet Tours confirming our booking Would recommend the Desert Safari  it is awesome  be careful if you are prone to travel sickness as the jeeps do throw you around a bit You can get a free shuttle bus to the sister hotel at Jumeriah Beach  which is well worth it for the day We can t wait for our next trip out there  
P =>   Fantastic  My Husband and I are just back from the Hilton Dubai Creek  we stayed there for   weeks for our Honeymoon and had a fabulous time  I can t recommend this hotel enough  Our room was a Creekside view deluxe located on the  th floor  this was a v large room with a v large bathroom  all freshly decorated and very clean  the view of the creek was out of this world  The only thing to watch out for was the mini bar       for a can of coke indeed  The amenities in the hotel were ok  the pool is a tad small and there were occasions when you had to wait a short while for a sun lounger  the bar Issimo was nice and the cocktails were good value between       to         the Glasshouse is where you get breakfast  you can choose from pancakes to a full English breakfast and they had plenty of cereals and fresh fruit  It is really well situated and a short taxi ride    mins          is the city mall here you will find a good selection of shops and eateries  I recommend you take a trip to Karama market as this is where the best deals happen and haggling is expected  we bought so much we had to ditch clothes to get everything in our suitcase  I would also recommend Mina Bazaar as that has also got a varied selection of restaurants and shopsWould definitely advise anyone going to check this hotel out 
P =>    out of    showed up at   in the morning due to flights and they wouldn t let me check in even though they had clean rooms available  instead i had to sit around the lobby for   hours then at   they finally let me check in  but that aside  the rooms were nice and modern though needed some maintenance  the bathtubs in two rooms that i was in didn t work for instance  far from everything but dubai is very spread out and you are never where you want to be  the taxis are super cheap and given the price that i paid for this hotel was really good i would stay again  the only other place i would think about staying is a hotel along the water if i felt like shelling out the money oh  and the pool was pretty spectacular  see picture  
P =>   Great location We stayed here for a week during ober and found it really difficult to fault the hotel  The staff  as is so often the case  are the greatest asset a hotel can have and the staff at the Dubai Creek Hilton were a cut above so many we have previously encountered  Within a couple of days we were being addressed by name  the staff at breakfast reserved a regular table for us and nothing was too much trouble  The accommodation was very good  we stayed on the thirteenth floor with marvellous views of the dhow wharf and the creek and were near enough to the roof top pool to walk up the stairs  where  although it is fairly compact there was always enough space and  although it was Ramadan  there was a screened area for the service of refreshments  most welcome in average day time temperatures of   C The room itself was large by any standards  with floor to ceiling windows and a large bathroom  The only gripe in this respect was that we had been sold the room as a triple  What this in fact meant was that a  camp bed   was provided  Luckily the third member of our party is quite petite and managed OK  but it was effectively only suitable for a child or small adult   I suggest that if you intend to book a triple or quad room you check what exactly you are getting  we booked through BA holidays  Food in the hotel was really very good   we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts and when not out and about  either dined in the Glasshouse restaurant or had room service The hotel organised a car and driver for us on most days and we did trips to Abu Dhabi and Al Ain  don t miss out on Jebel Hafeet if you do the latter  as well as being available for us most days for city tours and general running about  The cost was less than it would have been to go on organised trips with a tour company and I strongly recommend it rather than that or hiring a a car yourself We recommend the Heritage village and the Dubai museum  as well as the regular Gold Souk  shopping mall  dinner on a boat on the creek and similar excursions  We did not go to Wild Wadi and so can t comment  neither did we go dune bashing  but both seemed to be great fun for the young and energetic  we are neither   We strongly recommend a visit to the Jumeirah mosque  where they have short  an hour or so  educational visits for non Muslims after which questions can be put  which were answered with honesty and diplomatically   some questions were a bit confrontational The hotel also provided a shuttle service to the Hilton Jumeirah beach  which had a reasonable beach and provides facilities for changing and showering  as well as use of all the facilities  In addition there is a free shuttle service from the hotel to various locations in Dubai   a different location every day  this is not well advertised   you may need to ask  One last adverse criticism   the executive lounge is woefully small   only fourteen seats and three internet desk stools  On a number of occasions we couldn t get a seat for the happy hour free drinks and snacks and had to go elsewhere in the hotel and of course pay All in all though it is a great hotel  not too big      rooms or so   in a central location  near the airport  great staff and much quieter than it s sister hotel in Jumeirah  I strongly recommend it  
P =>   Very good but watch the sting in Ramsays My wife and I took a five day break from work in Saudi Arabia in y  Our first stay at the Hilton and a very good hotel but we were not happy with Ramsays restaurant  see below    We took one of the executive rooms on the upper floors  Modern decor  full height windows and a great bathroom  Good location with most places within a short taxi ride  Nice modern airy breakfast room and the exchange arangement with the Jumeirah Beach Hilton is worth using   we had a good day on the beach there  Staff were possibly too attentive   a number of calls from various members to check whether we were happy with the room tidyness etc etc  As to Ramsays   very good menu  excellent food but SMALL  and I mean small  portions  I was astonished however at the blatant con trick pulled by the staff as my wife and I arrived for our meal  As we sat down the waiter said  Glass of champagne sir  in such a manner that I  and my wife  assumed was some form of complimentary offer  It turned out that it wasn t   the bill came to over      Dh  about     pounds  and     Dh  about    pounds  of that was for the   glasses of champagne Mr Ramsay should attend to that  Until he does we shall eat elsewhere when next in Dubai  
P => Fantastic There is not one thing I would change about this hotel  Just in case you are booking for a break here are some things you might need to know The hotel offers complimentary beach transfers twice daily and use of the Hilton hotel at Jumeriah beach  a good way to get to Wild Wadi  Burj al Arab etc cheaply  It takes about   mins to get there The hotel is quite central to everywhere  virtually in the middle of Dubai  you need to get a taxi to most places however we never paid more than about     to the Mall of the Emirates I think Don t take the trips  desert safari etc from thehotel  you can get exactly the same trips for half the price if you ring the numbers in Time Out etc  which they have free in the rooms Eat in the Glasshouse restaurant  the food is great  the service is great and the prices are very reasonable Get your water from the supermarket behind the hotel  for the price of a litre and a half of Hilton s finest you can get about   ltrs from there Thats it  the rooms are huge  the bathroom is fantastic  the service is excellent  breakfasts are super and the pool is refreshing  
P => Worth a second trip  I booked a surprise trip for my husbands   th in uary    it was a little chilly for me though  It s a birthday he ll never forget the Hilton was immaculate  staff so friendly and helpful  room was perfect and the service  out of this world  I booked a safari dinner for him  We went out on a  x  in the desert  watched the sunset and even went to a camel farm  To top it off there was a buffet laid on for us  with plenty to eat and drink  At the end of the night they switched off the camp lights and all you could see was a sky full of stars   it was so romantic The malls are amazing and shopping is plentiful The buildings are amazing It s definitely worth a visit  Very child friendly in the beach hotels We loved it so much we re going again in ember  We ve booked tea at the Burj and will try the water park 
P =>   Great hotel  My    yr old son and I recently returned from a   day stay in Dubai  The Hilton Dubai Creek is a great hotel Although it clearly attracts many business clients it is a welcome break from Dubai s infamous concrete construction sights The service could not be faulted in the Glasshouse restaurant  Equally  hospitality was extended to us by the porters  housekeeping and front desk staff  Look out for Benedict  one of the reception staff who is a pleasure to talk to  Nothing is too much trouble  All the staff we encountered would give us tips on things to do and would generally enquire how we were doing whenever they saw us  It wasn t full on and  in your face   just sufficiently polite to appreciate their asking  In the morning  they would politely ask what our agenda was for the day and would warn us about over exposure to the fierce heat  I found all the staff to be extremely helpful  accomodating and we were definitely made to feel welcome  Housekeeping is  on point   We woke up to complimentary newspapers and bottled water was delivered every day  In the evening during  turn down  staff always lit a candle burner in the bathroom and this created a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere We stayed in a deluxe room which I think is their standard basic room  It was spacious  modern and extremely well maintained  The decor is tasteful without being too opulent or over the top  The floor to ceiling windows are wonderful with great views of the creek The bathroom is one of the best I ve seen from a   star hotel   glass  chrome  black marble  The shower is soothing Granted  it does not have much to offer families with young children  There is only the roof top pool which is small but never really full  a small gym and spa  I had an hour s aromotherapy massage and slept soundly thereafter  Older children and young couples who want to avoid the hussle and bustle of a typical holiday hotel will appreciate the Hilton Dubai Creek If you want a crowded beach hotel  lots of water activities and sea  you can always use the Hilton Dubai Creek s shuttle bus to travel to its sister hotel   Hilton Jumeira  Though the service is equally great  the food is not as lovingly prepared  Seemed almost mass produced  and lacked taste  It s easy to jump in a taxi and visit the many malls Dubai has to offer  The staff are most helpful  Always on hand to open doors for you or to hail a taxi  Before leaving for Dubai  I read a review where someone said that the staff at the Hilton Creek were unhelpful  Their comments definitely did not reflect my experiences I would stay at this hotel again without a doubt The Hilton Dubai Creek allows you to forget that surrounding areas in Dubai tend to be a mass of concrete construction  Even the beach Hilton hotel was surrounded by it  I found this off putting and was glad that I had made the right choice and decided to stay in the city  
P =>  Boring     After staying at many Dubai hotels  I was curious to try the Hilton Creek  BORING is the word to describe it I never once saw a breathing human in the lobby other than the front desk personel  The hotel bar was almost always empty This hotel is the only one in Dubai that did not give complimentary fruit and water daily  I never saw an apple or a bottle of water  When I checked out  I asked for a taxi  It was      am  The bell hop walked outside with me  We saw no taxis so he said he would call a private car for me  I said no  a taxi would be along soon  The bell hop then walked back in the hotel and I was left to stand on the curb hailing a taxi  I was FURIOUS  This is not   star service  After    minutes  a taxi came by and I hailed it and lifted my own luggage into the trunk  So much for the Hilton Creek  I had another upcoming reservation which I promptly cancelled The room was fine  The bathroom was very nice  But  there is no life in this establishment  
P =>  Wonderful hotel After using this webiste for reference to hotels I am glad that I choose this hotel  It was everything and so much more than I expected  the staff are oh so pleasant and helpful  I am going bck to Dubai early next year We arrived at     am and while our room was getting ready for us we had breakfast which was super  Within   minutes they called to let us know our room was ready   The staff are so friendly and helpful  We had a deluxe room and the bathroom was huge with a two person shower  I can t fault the hotel  the staff or anything about the Dubai  I am glad that I listen to my friend and stayed in the Creek  the Hilton twins with the Hilton Jumeriah Beach and you can use the facilities there complimentary  The beach is full of construction sites I would not stay on the beach  
P =>  Great  I stayed in Hilton Creek again recently and thoroughly enjoyed my stay  The location is fantastic  especially if you want to be near the creek  airport  museum  shopping etc  Excellent food in Glasshouse and Verre  or throughout is excellent  The only quibble I might have is that the executive lounge is a little small  Staff are wonderful  but the lounge was busy each night and some people had to turn away  
P =>  What a perfect start Wiritng this very late as have only recently started adding my experiences to tripadviser but hope it helps Stayed here on first leg of a three month round the world trip in        What a great start  this place was unbelievable  The rooms are simply fantastic  all wood  marble  glass  finished to an immaculate standard  Loads of space with all the gadgets you can think of and a bathroom that will make you blush  The floor to ceiling windows give you great views over the creek too The restaurant is fabulous  Gordon Ramsey I think  and served the most incredible breakfasts which we were delighted to discover were included in our price The rooftop pool is small but perfectly formed with great views and a nice bar area  Loads of thick white egyptian cotton towels add to the experience The petal filled pools in reception again add to the ambience and I would disagree with a previous review and say that this hotel is ideally placed if you are a tourist  A short stroll takes you to the wharf where you can enjoy dhow rides down the creek  The souks are a little further on and taxi s are a plenty  We did the big city bus tour  as you see in the UK  and it takes you all over the city  You can get on or off at leisure and see the various malls and things  Would also recommend a visit to the yacht club for the views and over water restaurant there  Also Asha s at Wafi City is a great place to eat Used the gym which is good too and took the courtesy bus to the sister Beach hotel and boy were we glad we didn t stay there  Nice hotel and beach area but the whole strip is a construction site  or at least it was Stayed in fourteen hotels on our trip  Three really stood out and this was one of them  
P => GREAT LEADERSHIP from the General Manager k Deere Had yet another terrific stay here  The hotel is fab and just oozes with style and comfort  a smallish hotel with a very personal service  The executive rooms are large and have great fabrics  woods and large panoramic windows  have previously stayed in a suite on the top floor with a large terrace  it was great The executive lounge is very small and gets quite smokey The restaurants aregood and service with a smile was beyond expectations Had a few problems during the stay  but a terrific response to get it right by all staff  and communication from the GM was prompt  articluate  with a genuine and positive can do attitude  until it was sorted Have absolutley no hesitations in staying there again  As a Hilton HHonors Diamond member expect a high service function  but the service attitude here flows to all guests   PB  
P =>  Massive Shower The Exec rooms are fantastic with  as I said  an enormous shower in the ensuite  Dissapointingly though  the Exec Lounge is tiny and cannot accommodate everyone  The rule of thumb appeared to be that Diamond VIP s get priority over Gold  Good restaurants and good cocktail bar  but pricey  Try the Italian   Cucinas     in the riott Hotel which is also superb  
P => Great stopover hotel Two superb days stay  Dubai is not a place for wandering and exploring  The City Centre is dull and  to women  threatening  The beach resorts   Jumeirah etc   could be anywhere in the World  But the hotel is great for a couple of days  We checked in after midnight and got a Panoramic Room   with two walls of glass with a great view   and the predicted comfortable bed  The rooftop pool and bar area is fabulous   for a relaxing day in the sunshine  with superb views across the City to the West with Burj al Arab in the haze dust    or so miles away  see photo   The cocktail bar off the lobby serves mountainous margheritas  But best fo all was the Gordon Ramsay Resyaurant   Verre  Efficient but not oleaginous service  Excellent food  very well presented  One of the best meals we have had  
P =>  Beautiful   Well located   Great Staff We stayed four nighrs in an  quot Executive Suite quot  which included breakfast and free airport transportation  We were picked up with a chauffered car at the airport The hotel looks brand new  It is not in a construction area  All of Jumeriah Beach is a mass construction site  We loved the hotel and staff  The rooms are huge  moden and have giant windows  
P =>  Modern hotel   city location Very modern and stylish hotel  The pool area is small   on the rooftop and the pool is not really large enough for swimming laps  I m a gold member and was redeeming points for a free stay  I was told to check in at the executive lounge   unfortunately no room upgrade was available and I was advised that the executive lounge was not open to gold members  only to executive floor guests  the lounge is very small   My wife was offered a free    min  massage as compensation   which she thoroughly enjoyed  The hotel staff was incredibly helpful and courteous This is clearly a business hotel and location   suggest that you stay along the beach if you are in town as a tourist   Madinat Souk is a very nice outdoor mall designed in Arabic style with many restaurants for dinner   not much shopping though   for shopping go to the Emirates Mall which is only a   minute cab ride away  
P => Do try Dubai Hilton Three nights at the Hilton wasn t enough  We could have stayed there forever  The room was large  with a comfortable  Queen sized bed  stylish bathroom and great views of the Creek  amp  the Etislat building  The printer seemed to take pride of place on the desk  which gave the room a rather businesslike feel  rather than one for a holiday  The front desk staff were helpful  polite if somewhat unfriendly  The breakfast room was bright  with a good selection of food on offer  It was a buffet style  so you could have as much as you liked  I throughly recommend the porridge  The hotel s trump card is the rooftop swimming pool  It is not huge  but ideal for a dip  in between sunbathing sessions  It is also a great vantage point for views of Dubai s skyline  The only real downside is that you have to pay to use the Internet  Which is surprising  as it was free at Dubai s Golden Sands apartments  As my laptop is Wi fi  I managed to pick up a number of signals from the surrounding area All in all it is a great hotel with fine facilities  Just a shame that it has the feeling of a hotel for business people rather than one for people on holiday  
P =>  Amazing  Just returned from a   night break staying at the Hilton Dubai Creek  An amazing hotel  We stayed in an executive room which was huge with fantastic views over the creek  Made good use of the facilities in the executive lounge The staff were excellent  very friendly and always polite  It was our first visit to Dubai and we loved it can t wait to go back  
P => Fantastic Hotel What a brilliant hotel  From the overly attentive management and staff to the rooms  food and views Get creek   ocean facing room on the corner and you will not be dissapointed The hotel I believe is one of Hiltons Lifestyle   Boutique range and it shows  It gets tiring walking into the room of business hotel and you are confronted with bed  desk  bathroom  In the room I had this was not the case  There are mixed materials from timber to marble and glass walls  Very much a wow factor Writing this review   years late but if nothing has changed you are in for a pleasant surprise  
P => Pefect hotel    Never wanted to leave    stay at this hotel its faultless    We arrived at the hotel around        Before passport control someone had a borad with our names  they intoduced themselves then said someone would be waiting on the otherisde  when we got thorugh passport contorl another representative was waiting by the baggage area  We got our bags and he took us through to the front of arrivals  We waited until   mins later the chueffeur was waiting outside  A great start to a great hotel We booked to stay on the excutive plus level which i beleive is the top   floors  We checked in at the executive lounge  From the second we arrived it was smiles and a high standard of service  There was   of us girls  all early    s  sharing a room   My only fault was that it had a king size bed and they had just put a little single bed in there  I took the short straw  After checking in we went to our rooms the lady explained that we have happy hour in the executive loung from     which we used on the sunday  It had most branded spirts and internet access  It also had nibbles  houmous and pitta  mini hamburgers  chicken kebabs etc   I found these bits very filling and made the most of it     The rooms were large and spacious  We had room     It had a cd player  english plugs  dvd and tv as well as   lamps acroos the room  The room had panaramic views meaning windows across two sides of the room  Request this room its the best  The room next door only had one side of panaramic views  The bathroom was large  It had a jacuzzi bath with was relaxing and a great treat  The shower was large and space just perfect  A waiter come to double check things were ok which was a nice touch Breakfast in the glasshouse downstairs was faultless  They serve plenty of cereal and fresh fruit as well as being able to order full breakfast which is much better than a buffet  I had a full english which was made with heinz beanz  some places palm you off with fakes      They are very effient and the manager evens welcomes you personally  I only saw one child while staying at the hotel  It does have business visitors on a daily basis and they also stay but also a few tourists  Although the hotel was full we never saw loads of people anywhere  It mainly older people that stay here  Not one person below    but that suits us women fine as we are very sensible and polite with manners The rooftop pool is fine There was always a sun lounger available even though there are only around      Its well enough as most are here on business  The views are breath taking and really set the scene  We sunbathed everyday  The pool man would always offer drinking and move our loungers in the direction of the sun  The bar was at the back area and you can also eat on the rooftop A shuttle bus runs to the jumeriah hilton   times a day but I dont feel theres a need to go there The service in this hotel is so personal its unbeleivable  They treat you like family and no one is above anyone The hotel is close to the al karma market where the fake bags are and on the same road as the gold souk  Also the burjuman and diera city mall are very close by  Its very cheap to get around any ways taxi s are dirt cheap We had cocktails at issimo which I must recommend  I had a mai tai and they do a lovely coktail called ms collins  Dinner at the verre restruant is recommended especially if you are staying here  we chose not to have starters but they bring our bread type sticks with lovely dipping suacing  The service in this place is second to none  They are so attentive and friendly its a joke  For main course I had   caistaing duck brest with five spice turnips  caramelised chestnuts  baby onions and madeira   It was medium rare and ver tastful  The duck brest was exquisite and ive never tasted anything like it  The added extras on the dish made it faultless My friend had the seabass which she throughly enjoyed For desert I had the chocolate founde  BVefore that they brouhg out a strawberry sorbet in a kind of shot glass  it has rasberry sauce at the bottom  fresh yogurt in the middle and tsraberry sorbet on top  It was an unexpected touch that made the whole experiance ever more worth while  All in all it was     dirhams which is nothing for two mains and a desert in a gordan ramsey restraunt  they extended our checkout to  pm as we had a late flight  we used the gym to change and it had all the facilities All in all this hotel gets my vote and I would return there in an instant  the staff are amaing and I cant wait to go back  any questions pls ask    ps   i will add pics soon 
P => Perfect city centre hotel An excellent hotel  situated right on the creek side  overlooking the dhow wharfage Everything was impeccible  from check in to room service  excellent value  and the limo transfer to the airport Book an Executive room and you get free drinks  including alcoholic drinks between   and  pm  as well as afternoon tea and canapes pre dinner We have nothing but praise for the hotel  we stayed there for our honeymoon and the bed and jacuzzi were decorated with rose petals  and we received a bowl of fruit and congratulations card The staff were wonderful too  quietly courteous and very efficient Food was of a very high standard in The Glasshouse restaurant and room service offered very good value for money  
P =>  Impeccably run hotel We stayed here for a couple of nights whilst on route back to the UK from Thailand  If the quality of this hotel is anything to go by I have no idea how Hilton are going to top it with the Conrad they are planning to build here  The Hotel only gets   stars  although it is hard to see how this doesn t get    The hotel was full because of the shopping festival and so we weren t able to get the usual Diamond upgrade to an executive room  The  standard  room however was far from disappointing  The hotel is furnished to an extremely high quality and the rooms are very tastefully designed  The room was spacious and had some great views of the business district  The overall theme is modern and slightly minimalist   futuristic  Black marble and polished aluminium adorn all parts of the hotel giving the hotel a slightly menacing mood at times  If sumptuous luxury and colourful d cor appeal then this hotel is probably not right for you The service was impeccable and it s clear that the hotel take customer satisfaction very seriously  I would say professional and efficient rather than the traditional  service with a smile  like you get at home  Any complaints or problems are taken very seriously and immediately escalated  This hotel means business  The Glasshouse served some wonderful lunches and breakfasts  we were particularly impressed with the vegetarian Lasagne  Verre was a little disappointing  Gordon Ramsey   some of the food was way too salty  e g  Scallops  and quite over priced  It would have been nice to see more local ingredients   inspired dishes to choose from  Excellent food but didn t quite live up to our expectations  The rooftop pool is quite small but boasts some great vies of the city  especially at night  The party shower in our room was huge and a nice touch  Unfortunately the executive lounge is only available to those guests actually staying in executive rooms and not those with Diamond cards  However the management did allow us to use the Internet facilities there for free which they didn t have to do  Location is not great if you are visiting Dubai for pleasure  but a constant supply of Taxi s will ensure you get to your destination on time and for a reasonable price  There is also a free transfer to the beach  Personally I would rather stay here than at the beach Hilton which is slap bang in the middle of the worlds largest building sit 
P =>  Awesome  I stayed here two nights with my fiance  Words cannot describe how awsom this hotel is  The rooms are a work of art and the hotel itself is an architectural statement  Everything about this hotel including the service is        
P =>   great staff great location  I stayed in this hotel for business  and enjoyed the fact that it s a smaller hotel  but with all the service and amenities you d expect from a big chain  It s not really near anything  but convenient to everything  the airport  shopping  restaurants  souks  etc  Staff went out of their way to be courteous  and even called me by name  My minor complaint is that it would be nice to have a coffee bar or a place for a quick bite take out  but maybe that s just because I m American Rooms are huge  great views  ultra modern  very quiet  Would stay there again without hesitation  
P =>   Perfect  I have taken in consideration the excellent reviews on this website when I booked a room in this hotel and was really impressed  Very classy  quiet  friendly with very nice views over the creek  I would recommand it to anyone who is planning to visit Dubai  Many thanks to all the staff at the hotel who made our holiday a fantastic one  and to all reviewers who recommanded this hotel on this website  
P =>  Loved this hotel We stayed in the hilton for   days from the   th   This hotel is a MUST  The room was lovely with amazing views of the creek  and a wonderful sunken jacuzzi in the bathroom  the bed was huge and the room was very well equipped  Lovely toilteries too  The staff were extremely attentive and couldn t do enough for us  The food was incredble   we dined in both Verre  amp  Glasshouse  Verre was truly delicious and one of the best meals I ve ever had   portions were good  amp  the wine list extensive  Glasshouse is less formal but a lovely restaurant serving good food if you want something a little less  wow  than the Gordon Ramsay Verre The roof top pool has great views and they serve lovely food as well  although if you don t get there early you may struggle to get a spot  All in all a fab hotel  and one I would return to tomorrow  
P =>  Great place great rooms but        I stayed at the Hilton Dubai Creek Hotel for the biggest exhibtion in the region  GITEX  I know and like the area where it is situated  as you can walk about the dhow wharfage  Although whilst I was there  the road was subject to extensive repair and crossing it was life threatening The hotel  is without doubt  a high class hotel  for high class clients  The two restuarants offering  standard  high class food  especially Gordan Ramsey s  and the bar very sassy But  if you want to  slob  out a bit  watch the big match taking place in Europe no chance  You can  and I did  walk over to the Sheraton  my prefered hotel in Dubai   Htey have a great variety of restuarants  Indian  Japanese  Italian and the English pub The roof top pool is small but adequate  having great views over the creek and city The rooms are large  clean  well equiped and the bed is very comfortable Yes I would stay again  but with my wife not for business  Stay at the Sheraton if you need variation in cuisine  
P =>  This hotel is the business   quite literally  Having spent four nights at the Hilton Dubai Creek  t             I can only say that the experience was very very refreshing  Having come from a family wedding in Karachi  Pakistan  my family decided to visit Dubai on the way back to refresh and replenish and also to find out what all the hype was about regarding Dubai having been there    years ago when things were much different We chose to be picked up from the airport at   pm when our flight landed by the hotel limousine which in this case turned out to be a Toyota people carrier   albeit a very comfortable one  The very courteous driver immediately offered us plastic containers of ice cold mineral water which was a very thoughtful touch as it was    degrees at that time of night  Day temperatures reached    degrees  The cost of this transportation is    dhirams each way which is about   pounds  how ever it should be noted that a taxi would probably charge    dhirams  around       On arrival the receptionist could not find a deluxe plus room that we had booked so upgraded us to an executive room which was very very nice  We had panoramic views of the Creek and the business district  this looks amazing both in the day and at night  The bathroom is awesome  our had a sunken jacuzzi bath and a separate large walk in shower  It all done in black marble with lots of mirrors giving a feeling of openess  Next to the jacuzzi was a clay pot with a candle in it which was lit every evening whilst were out and our beds were turned down  this was all part of the turn down service The Glass House Restaurant and Gordon Ramsay s Vere seemed a bit pricey and I couldn t see the point as I could always eat in Gordon s London restaurants for the same price so didn t chose to eat there  but give it a go Breakfast which was included in our tariff was excellent in the Glass House restaurant  the waiters are very attentive  There is a buffet of cold salamis  breads and so on  in addition you can choose from the hot menu e g  fried eggs  bacon  surprising for a muslim country   but they cater for all  etc In all I was very pleased with my choice of hotel in Dubai  I am glad I did not stay by the beach  I visited the Hilton Jumeirah Beach Hotel which seems excellent except for the massive amount of building work that is going on right on top of the hotel with huge skyscrapers being erected as part of the  quot Jumeirah Residence quot  development  the cranes being used in this work are massive and plentiful Hilton Dubai Creek   EXCELLENT        
P =>  Great Rooms and Staff a few niggles I stayed at the Hilton Dubai Creek in tember       We had booked a standard room on the  th floor  but the room was fantastic  The shower was enormous and the bathroom in general was amazing  The staff are extremely friendly and you are made to feel unbelievably welcome  A few niggles  there is a lot of construction work around the hotel and creek which makes it hard to walk around anywhere  Its pretty near impossible to do somethng as simple as cross the road to the creek  not because of the traffic but because there is nowhere to cross it  We did hear noise from the construction work at  am every morning  There are only   lifts in the hotel and we found we spent a lot of time waiting for these to arrive  not helped by the fact that after numerous searches  we couldn t find any stairs  only what appeared to by fire escape stairs  The hotel is also quite dark  both the room and the lobby  The rooftop pool is lovely but can be quite hard to get a sun bed as there are only about    of them  I would recommend getting the free bus to the Hilton Jumeirah Beach if you want to do any major sunbathing  Also  I would highly recommend a camel safari in the desert  Great fun  
P =>   modern hotel but with dancing   I have been in this hotel in      and did not return because of the noise coming from the disco dancing  Secondly the lack of the staff to listen to the  quot normal quot  guests whatever you ask  it was too much  If you need to be in the Dubai World Trade Center the location is not ideal  the positive is the very nice but small rooftop pool  The rooms are nice and well equipped  
P => Excellent Holiday at Hilton Creek Myself and my Wife spent a lovely    days at the Hilton Creek  and found it to be an excellent choice of Hotel Firstly  we found the best rate was directly via their website  The main strengths of this Hotel I would suggest as follows a  Great location  very near City Centre Mall  which has some great shopping and also Cinemas  Bowling etc nice for kids  and Adults  to get out of the blistering heat for a couple of hours b  Very friendly staffc For Beach lovers it offers a free shuttlebus to the Hilton Beach Resort in Dubaid  Spacious rooms that has many Satelite channels including Sky News  CNN We previously stayed at the World Trade Centre Hotel in Dubai  but found the Hilton to be superior  Hope this helps  The only slight fault is that pool  on the roof  is a little smaller than you would expect  but still was adequate   
P => Wonderful Hotel Stayed   nights at this hotel at the beginning of our honeymoon  Had a wondeful time  Upgraded to a panoramic jacuzzi room  fabulous views of the creek during the day and at night  Roof top pool was excellent and was not that busy  Dinner at Verre was out of this world and very memorable  The martini bar was very good too  The staff were extremely helpful  polite and very professional  Facilities at the hotel are excellent and I would certainly stay there again  There was a bit of building work next to the hotel but nothing like what we saw or experienced at Jumeria beach constant building noise and work  A high standard hotel with excellent service and facilities  
P => High Class Hilton I stayed at the Hilton   nights ago for the second time  both occasions with friends on a stag party  The hotel is excellently located to shop  restaurants and night life I particulary like the rooms  a deluxe plus room is the one to have  I just love contempary style rooms  bathroom dressed in black marble and chrome with a lovely jacuzzi overlooking the creek Not so sure if it is hotel for families  maybe for couples but definatley for friends singles  as it is not so romantic as most and is lively on Thursdays with a disco nite The staff are impecable  my room was cleaned over twice  the bed turned over  candle in the bathroom lit  superb The swimming pool on the rooftop is excellent  a daily meeting place morning  afternoon and evening I have stayed in dubai twice and both at Hilton  however when I get married next year maybe look for somewhere a bit more romantic and traditional Still a top class Hotel   
P => Terrible Noise Problems This visually pleasing hotel markets itself as a contemporary business hotel  but a warning to anyone who requires peace and quiet after a hard day s slog in this frantic city   avoid the Hilton Dubai Creek like the plague  Two stays have been ruined by terrible noise levels emanating from a disco on the mezzanine level  It booms through the bedrooms and sleep is impossible until the music stops around  am  On the first occasion  a Thursday night  I was told this was a regular party night  the staff were unresponsive to my pleas to end the disturbance and refused to change my room  principally it seems because every room in the hotel is affected  Be warned  the hotel structure cannot smother noise and music from the mezzanine floor  On another stay  this time a Tuesday  the same thing happened to myself and colleagues but was made even worse by a party outside the bedrooms which again went on until  am  As a result of which our sleep was destroyed and business trips ruined  Fortunately my company has removed this hotel from its approved global hotels list  It is unacceptable that a hotel is allowed to treat its guests in this way and that no amount of discussion with staff or the Duty Manager has any effect  The Hilton Group should be ashamed of this establishment

P => One of the best visited hotel of my life        Stayed in this hotel in         amazing hotel  amazing staff and food  We had breakfast every monring in the hotel which was fab  then at lunch time we went to KFC which is only   mins walk away from the hotel  then for tea we went to one of the restuarants on the  WALK   This hotel is in the best location as you have everything around you  a great private beach  with your own beach butler who gives you free cups of ice    dont take your own beach towels as you have to use the hotels own   then you are over the road from the best restaurants  shops etc  Make sure you go to TFI fridays which is on the uper tier of the  WALK   cheap food but big portions  Take a cab from outside the hotel and go to the mall  which is about    mins away in the cab  ask the hotel what is the biggest mall  
P => excellent hotel Room  rate and staff excellent  Service at the pool restaurant a bit slow  
P =>   Amazing hotel and location Stayed in this hotel in        amazing hotel  amazing staff and food  We had breakfast every monring in the hotel which was fab  then at lunch time we went to KFC which is only   mins walk away from the hotel  then for tea we went to one of the restuarants on the  WALK   This hotel is in the best location as you have everything around you  a great private beach  with your own beach butler who gives you free cups of ice    dont take your own beach towels as you have to use the hotels own   then you are over the road from the best restaurants  shops etc  Make sure you go to TFI fridays which is on the uper tier of the  WALK   cheap food but big portions  Take a cab from outside the hotel and go to the mall  which is about    mins away in the cab  ask the hotel what is the biggest mall  We are going to go back in sep         
P =>  Perfectly adequate My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah for five nights in late ober        as a bit of luxury after four weeks of budget travel around Egypt  Jordan  Syria and Turkey  The hotel was very much as we expected for a five star hotel    luxurious and clean with professional staff  a lovely pool  great swimming beach and a breakfast buffet stocked with the foods that we d been missing   The mini bar  room service  restaurants and laundry service were also what I ve grown to expect from luxury hotels    overpriced  Our deluxe sea view room had a gigantic bed and plenty of room to spread out Picking a location in Dubai is difficult as it is so big  If you want to laze by the beach pool and do a little shopping then the location of the Hilton Jumeirah is perfect  There is an outdoor mall behind the hotel which has some good  affordable cafes and restaurants  It s not great for shopping though  as it is very spread out and was uncomfortably hot during the day  even in late ober  There are sporadic courtesy buses which run to some of the major malls which are more suitable for the shopaholics In terms of other attractions  the Burj Al Arab  Wild Wadi  Madinat Jumeirah  the Mall of the Emirates and Ibn Battuta Mall are all a short taxi drive away  It was less than     AUD to get to each of those destinations by taxi  though the Aussie dollar was very strong when we were there The city centre  including the souks and Deira area  was almost double the distance of the other attractions  We got into the city using a combination of the courtesy bus to the Mall of the Emirates and then the recently partially opened MRT train  Travel around Dubai will be considerably easier when the MRT is fully opened but  even then  the Hilton Jumeirah is not within walking distance to a station Overall  a great hotel for people looking for a little relaxation and luxury while still being able to access the other areas of Dubai with a little effort  
P =>   Hilton  best rate guarantee  doesn t mean its rates are lowest   BEWARE I tried to book this hotel today on Hilton s website  The website proudly claims that there is a Best Rate Guarantee  stating that you will not find lower rates on other sites  I thought it was worth checking  so I checked the price via Tripadvisor recommended sites  and I was offered a rate     per night lower on both Expedia and Hotels com  I called Hilton Reservations  the woman I spoke to said  quot oh yes  the rates are normally much cheaper on Expedia than on Hilton com  quot   The only way to benefit from Hilton s Best Rate Guarantee is to book with Hilton   even if you know the rate is cheaper elsewhere   then within    hours you have to submit a claim to them and if they decide the claim is valid  they ll match the rate you ve found elsewhere  I just think it s important that everyone knows that Hilton s own staff admit that rates are normally cheaper on other sites  So just because you see the words  quot best rate guarantee quot  it doesn t mean that you can t find a cheaper rate  
P =>   Dubai and Hotel lived up to expectations Our first time in Dubai and we were not dissapointed  The Hilton hotel is smaller than many others of this class in Dubai but the location and standards of service are second to none  The beach and gardens are beautiful and provide the perfect place to escape  I had read about the breakfsat and again have to agree with the reviews it really is very good and provides an excellent start to the day  Unfortunately you have to pay for wi fi but my teenage daughter found free access in cafe across the road  The location is great with the  Walk  across the road offering a wide selection of shops  cafes and restaurants  The free shuttle bus services to the shopping malls are well run and efficient although I have to say as an alternative the taxis are very cheap and numerous  although I don t think the drivers have to undergo any type of knowledge test as I could find my way around better than them after a few days    Again having read the reviews we bought an Entertainer and this saved us a fortune with vouchers covering Aquaventure  Ski Dubai  Desert Safari etc   plus a host of eating places  We tried the monrail to the Atlantis and this is worth it for the ride itself with spectacular views of the palm  hotel and water park  The weather was fantastic throughout  We had a great time and will definitely be returning  
P =>   Great Hotel for Beach Lovers Have just returned from a relaxing break at the Hilton  From the moment you step out of the taxi you are made to feel very welcome  All the staff are friendly and helpful  Rooms are a good size  modern and clean  The breakfast buffet is excellent  Bice restaurant was very  very good but it is expensive  The beach is fantastic  clean white sand with crystal clear water  The front sunbeds were always reserved by the time we got to the beach at       a bit annoying when nobody turns up to use them until        There are also chairs you can take into the water to sit and cool down  Beach towels are provided  There were no building works going on whilst we were there however it does look like they are about to start next door  Very good location on  The Walk   although there are still a lot of shops that haven t opened yet  There are plenty of places to eat but mediocre food for the price  Good for people watching  We went to the Mall of the Emirates and Dubai Mall  If I only had time for one I d choose Dubai Mall  They are a distance away but taxis are reasonable  approx    dirhams to M of E      minutes and    dirhams to D M      minutes  We had afternoon tea at the Burj al Arab hotel  expensive but a wonderful experience but hey I m never going to be able to afford to stay there so worth it  Didn t need an evening meal that night  All in all a great holiday  we d love to return and would definitely recommend the Hilton  
P =>   Great stay as always  This was our third stay at this hotel  We have always found that the Hilton Jumeriah to be great value  The staff on this stay were as friendly and helpful as always  The Hilton breakfast is great and the egg stations are always busy but food cooked to order so the wait  if any  is worth it The prices in Dubai at present are very high due to the poor GBP  Drinks in the hotel are expensive but the view from the roof bar is worth a little bit extra The area has changed greatly since our first visit but I have to say it s for the better  The Walk is lovely in the daytime and bustling at night  There are many restaurants to choose from but be aware that there is no alcohol on sale in these establishments Overall the Hilton Jumeriah is worth a visit  
P =>  paradise best accomodation ever  beatiful beach with nice view on palm jumeirah  atlantis hotel and burj al arab    breakfast is untoppable    
P =>   Lovely hotel in great location but beware builign work about to start Have just come back from an   night stay at the Hilton  Having previously stayed at the Jumeriah Beach Hotel our expecations were high but we weren t diappointed  Upon arrival was upgraded to an executive suite which was a fantastic room with lovely views over the sea  However the view the other way was of a wall of high rise apartment blocks and a building site which is about to start having just laid the footings  The private beach is lovely but it is sandwiched between two public beaches which on a Friday becomes like Benidorm  except there are camel rides available    The executive package is worth it if you fancy an alcoholic drink of an evening as you can drink as much as you like for free and as alcohol is very expensive in the UAE     for a glass of wine or a pint you can get your monies worth The service is really good and staff are very attentive and friendly but eating in the hotel is expensive so its location on the walk is ideal as there are many restaurants you can go to  Also the free buses to the shopping malls  all of which have food courts which are even cheaper  although no alcohol is served can certainly save you money  Having been a frequent visitor to Dubai over the last    years you can see that a lot of the holiday brochures are using old photos that do not show the building work that has taken place over recent years  so you will find the view is not as you would expect  e g  the photos of this hotel do not show the tower blocks  Jumeirah palm and cranes that dominate the skyline  Overall a great holiday but would not go back to this hotel because the further buidling work next door will spoil it  
P =>   Exceeded Our Expectations  From the moment we arrived at     am and were ushered to the executive lounge on the  th floor for our check in to the moment we left with the door staff telling our taxi driver exactly the sights we wanted to see on our way back to the airport the Hilton exceeded our expectations First of all I need to make clear that I am a Hilton Honors Diamond Member  but you can never take anything for granted  We travelled to Dubai to celebrate my wife and her twin sister s   th birthday  and on arrival we were taken to the executive lounge for breakfast   we didn t expect that  then they told us we had been upgraded and our first room was ready  but our second wasn t  and we could have had another second room but they had allocated us     and      these are two rooms with   sides of floor to ceiling glass walls over looking the beach  which have a seperate main entrance so can be closed off  we didn t expect that  when the phone rang I was greeted by the room service manager asking at what time would we like the birthday cakes  yes cakes  delivered  I decided  pm Thursday would be nice  just as we arrived back from skiing    guess what yes at      pm they were being delivered  I can t rate highly enough the executive lounge  great selection for breakfast  open all day for coffee  fruit  soft drinks  afternoon tea  pm til  pm  sandwiches  cakes  scones    and happy hour from  pm til     pm   more than just free drinks  pretty much anything you want   sorry Neil  also a selection of sweet and savoury nibbles and a tray of warm finger foods       Of course all the staff were exceptionally polite  the rooms cleaned thoroughly and checked again at  quot turn down quot   and the beach location was great    I could go on but at the risk of being boring I ll stop   but there is one other point  when we checked out my bill was   AED that s     nothing  zero   I booked using Honors points and fully utilised the hospitality offered by executive lounge  thanks Momtaz    which meant more for the wife to spend in the shops and on trips     
P =>  An awesome location   staff couldn t be more helpful  This hotel is in a brilliant location   right on the beach  but also across the road from  quot The Walk quot  which has loads of restaurants and is great for evenings  There are loads of great places to go nearby  Atlantis  the Burj Al Arab  Dubai Mall etc etc  and cabs are really cheap  The hotel also has free shuttle buses which take you to all of the shopping malls  We had breakfast included   which was brilliant  but other than that we triend not to eat  amp  drink in the hotel  the food is quite expensive and the ICE bar on the tenth floor lacks atmosphere   The private beach was really well maintained  and the pool was nice too  Sea is hot and fish free  which is great if you dont like fish   All in all a great hotel in a perfect location  
P =>  excellent Great hotel with great location in the middle of JBR walk  but they have a little problem with shower water it s temperature changes Constantly  amp  the internet access is very expensive  
P =>  Wow  Amazing hotel in an amazing location  We spent four nights at this hotel and loved every minute  We were able to check in at     a m   much earlier than we had been told we could  and although we arrived so much earlier  the reception were incredibly apologetic that we could not check in as soon as we arrived The hotel is stunning and the pool area is lovely  It can get busy although there was always somewhere to find a lounger  The private beach was clean and had loads of free loungers  The sea was wonderful   very warm Food and drink were good   we chose to upgrade to the  executive package  which gave us happy hour each day for free drinks and snacks   we thought it was well worth the GBP   per day  You also get to use the executive dining suite  which is at the top of the hotel and offers great views of the beach and sea There are several bars dotted about the perfectly manicured grounds Each morning we were greeted by name and asked what we were doing that day to see how the concierge could help This really was an amazing stay  
P => 	Star Service The rooms are this hotel are nothing special  but the service is definitely   star  The staff is wonderful and catered to our every need during our stay The location is good with a nice beach and within walking distance of restaurants and shops at the Walk  The breakfast buffet is excellent with lots of choices and great service The rooms are just ok  They are not fancy  but they are comfortable  We had a seaview room  which had an ok view of the Arabian Sea and the beach This hotel is the cheapest of the big hotels on the beach  and it is an excellent value  
P =>   As always a great hotel This was my third time staying at the Hilton over the space of  yrs and it never changes  Had a great room and could see the Atlantis hotel from my bed which was nice  Rooms are spacious and very clean  tv with movie channels  Breakfast is fab with great a choice of nearly anything you wanted and all cooked freshly  Staff are always there to help  Cab ride from teh airport worked out about      Stock up on soft drinks froma local shop if you can as they are very expensive in the hotel  Everyone takes drinks down to the pool and just ask for a cup of ice which is perfectly safe to drink  All of the big shopping centres lay on free mini buses from the hotel so ask for a time table at reception this way you will save a fortune on cab fairs  One thing to warn you about  i dont have a credit card and they ask for one at check in  They said to use if you only have a visa debit card then they have to put the transaction through for a certain amount each day to cover mini bar etc and then they would give you the cash back when you check out  We made a big fuss as i didnt want over       diahams in cash as i was leaving the country  Make sure you argue this point if it does come up as its stupid  In the end they said they would not charge us a but just take an imprint of the card  would def stay again  
P =>   Great Vacation  This is the first time ever that I write a review but I think this vacations was worth it  We where kind of expectant in travelling to Dubai and really found it amazing  the hotel is of total american comfort  We stayed for   nights and they really gave us a nice full sea view room for a reasonable price  We were afraid of the ongioing constructions but there is nothing to be worried about there are minor things going around and there are no noises  The beach is wonderful I have travelled a lot to the caribbean and Hilton Jumeirah beach is really similar  The attention is excellent and everyone in the hotel is help ful and nice  we would come back any time and I hope soon  Dubai is a great city to explore and to relax  restaurants are great and is safe to travell around  People think of Dubai as expensive  from my point of view you can make it as expensive as you want but I can guarantee that it is cheaper than London or even Paris  prices are similar to Madrid  
P =>   Not bad won t blow your socks off but solid hotel I stayed here for a week on a B amp B basis during t      I paid      for the week  I would say this is a good solid property  rooms are clean   staff are excellent and breakfast is great Things to bear in mind the rooms are not Dubai glitz  no marble bathrooms with Walk in rain showers    standard over the bath showers and the bathrooms are pretty small    pretty much as you would get in any    Uk chain hotel It is on the Walk which is great from some variety of reasonably priced alternatives to the hotel  just bear in mind that despite these     eateries being on your doorstep  being Dubai none of them are licenced for alcohol as you can only drink in hotels in Dubai I have stayed at several hotels in Dubai over the years and this one is fine    it won t blow you away but it won t disappoint either  Staff are very helpful  the beach is great albeit boiling in Spetember    however if you are expecting some of the Dubai glamour you won t find it here   but then at this price you are getting exactly what you are paying for  
P =>   Slightly over rated   All in all  we were a little disappointed with our stay at the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah  especially after having read so many positive reviews on this site and others  Have to say that we were definitely expecting more from this supposed   star hotel Our check in on arrival was slow and despite arriving at  pm  check in time  our rooms were not ready until an hour plus later  We were offered sea view rooms  for quite an expensive supplement  only to find that our  sea view  overlooked the roof of the main hotel building below  the other wing of hotel rooms with the sea in the distance  Not quite what the check in guy had sold to us and certainly not worth the supplement we paid for Room itself was a bit nondescript and nothing to write home about  The bathroom was tiny with barely enough room to get in  Nothing about the room  balcony or view was   star  There also seemed to be a bit of a problem with noise disturbance   you could hear people in the corridors  in the rooms above etcThe staff themselves all seemed to be very well trained  but found that a lot of them seemed to lack personality or genuine friendliness  Ian and a number of the Concierge team really stood out as fantastic staff members as did the kids club staff and k  our house keeper  but that was about it  Restaurant staff in the main buffet restaurant seemed to be v efficient in the morning at the breakfast buffet  but service at lunchtimes if eating off the menu was appalling  really slow and inefficient The hotel has a fantastic beach  pretty landscaped gardens and a lovely swimming pool BUT there is a really big problem with people reserving sun beds by putting their towels out first thing in the morning  which I think the hotel really should do something about  The area around the pool and the hotel gardens are actually quite small  so the fact that people are reserving sun beds seemed to be a problem with most people we chatted  The management really should do something about this as it s obviously a problem Our kids used the children s club on the  rd floor of the hotel and a special thanks goes to Iresh and Alitha  The kids  play room is fantastic with loads of activities and things to do for children of all ages and our   spent many hours playing inside when it was too hot to be out Location of the hotel is really good  It is situated on The Walk and so there are loads and loads of restaurants and cafes within a couple of minutes walk  There are also a few shops  ATMs and a supermarket close by  All in all  a bit hit and miss really  There is no way I think this hotel deserves a   star rating  not compared to say the Ritz  Royal Mirage  Madinat hotels etc  We made the most of our stay at the hotel and enjoyed its facilities and location  but just found that it didn t offer anything special in terms of accommodation or service and for that reason I wouldn t go back  
P =>   Loved it  We spent a week at this hotel at the end of our Honeymoon  It is a typical Hilton hotel  very clean and tidy and well looked after  We stayed B amp B and the breakfast is out of the world  you want it  you get it  The staff are fantastic  they can t do enough for you The hotel only has   draw backs      people are allowed to leave towels on the sun loungers round the pool and then come back hours later to use them      the cost to eat inside the hotel it is way over priced the hotel is based on the Jumeirah walk and there are lots and lots of places to eat  we found a fantastic Indian a   minute walk from the hotel that did a   course meal for   for only      the food was great and the same meal back here would cost well over     For those of you who love a burger  go to Fuddruckers  It is advertised as the worlds best burgers    they are not kidding  I had the famous  lb burger   it was the size of my hand     but it was sooooo good  again this restaurant is only minutes from the hotel and very reasonably priced Would i recommend this hotel    certainly it is in a great location with good access to everythingWhen there we did the modern Dubai trip that ended with High Tea at the Burji al arab  the sail hotel   this was expensive to do but a good trip to do  maybe skip the high tea its not that good  It takes you round and gives you some of the history of Dubai as well as a trip to one of the huge malls with an inside aquarium   i found Nemo and Dory   You also get taken to the tallest building in the world    it s not easy to get a full length picture of it  Would i recommend going to Dubai    yes  but in a few years time  the place is still a building site with lots and lots of weird and wonderful looking buildings getting built  
P =>  Excellent hotel We ve stayed for two weeks at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach Resort and it was a very good experience It was our first time in a Hilton hotel and certainly not the last The room was nice  clean  spacious  we used the hot watercooker every day for a cup of tea  The only commend is the noise of the hallway  The door of the room does not prevent the noise of people walking  running  talking  screaming  etc  Breakfast was very complete  everything you wanted was available The hotelgarden is very nice with enough beds  only in the weekend it gets really crowded by locals  The only thing we did not like was that a lot of people reserved their bed with a towel  Especially in the weekend  if you wanted to have a bed in the shade in the garden you needed to place your towel before      hrs otherwise only the beds on the beach were available  to hot  And also use of internet is very  very expensive  But there are enough Starbucks around  on the Walk  with free wireless internet  so we advise you to go to Starbucks for a great cup of coffee and free wireless internet The Walk is just outside the hotel  A lot of good restaurants and very nice price  We recommend The Butcher Shop  amp  Grill  We ve never had beef that was so tasty   I would certainly recommend this hotel and maybe we come back in a few years to see which buildings are finished  
P =>  Great hotel great beachside location I stay here   times a year and cant fault it  Great service  good location  right by the beach and nice big pool area too  What makes this quite special and unique from the other hotels is that around the hotel used to be nothing  but the last   years they have developed  quot the walk quot  where there are big wide pavements  lots of shops  bars and restaurants all very new and recently opened  This is so not like Dubai   You can wander out at night  walk up and sown the beautifly lit street and take a few drinks coffee  Normally in Dubai you have to get taxis everywhere even if going across the street  but not here  so ideal for families The hotel itself is wonderful  the staff are so polite and in fact  maybe too much so  its like they are trained to smile and say hello the moment you make eye contact with them  even the cleaners and maintenance men seem pleased to see you  You cant move without someone popping out from somewhere to wish you a pleasant stay and  quot How Are you Sir  quot  Great at first  but the novilty wears off  Overall a great hotel  good food  Bice is nice but AWFULLY expensive    great loactiona dn wonderful people     
P =>  Good Hotel Value for Money Having just returned from a   night stay at the Hilton Jumeirah  everything I have to feedback about the hotel is positive    Hotel is best accessed by taxi which at     am in the morning cost approx    AED   The room was spacious  clean and modern and had a balcony overlooking the  quot towers quot   these are various apartment blocks that the hotel backs onto   Check in was very prompt and offered us a welcome drink in the foyer on our arrival    We booked two trips through the hotel   Afternoon Tea at the Burj al Arab and the  x  jeep safari  both were handled incredibly well by the rep at the Customer Relations desk   Mall of the Emirates and Dubai Mall both run shuttle buses to and from the malls and these stop at the Hilton  at various times throughout the day   There is also a courtesy bus that will pick you up from the Hilton and take you to the first stop on the Big Bus Company tour bus  which leaves from Madinat Souk   Our package included Breakfast and this was standard Hilton breakfast with a little bit more  and the staff in the dining room were more than helpful  replacing tea coffee and cleaning up after you   The pool area was very good  with plenty of sun loungers to go round and a nice big pool for swimming    The beach facilities were even better  with a private beach and butler service for cold water  additional extra  and cold towels    For those that have kids  there are specialised gaming rooms at the end of some corridors  which have more than enough to keep them entertained  Although be wary if you get a room next to these as it can be noisy  These close a   pm each night   The hotel is situated in an area called the Walk  that has lots of restaurants and shops if you don t want to venture too far from the hotel Overall the hotel was a great standard  probably not the most flash of hotel in Dubai  but thoroughly worth the money  
P =>  fantastic hotel We have just spent   nights here   in a de lux seaview and the other   we upgraded to executive seaview  worth the extra  Our  st morning we went down to breakfast in the lobby and had to wait       mins in a holding bay  quite comfy but what a drag  then went for breakfast where there was excellent food  but on returning to our table it had been moved and our drinks had disappeared but no drama we just asked for more   After this we ate breakfast in the executive lounge  again good food not quite as much choice and no egg station  but a more personal service with excellent  attentive staff   We had a lovely afternoon tea everyday which on more than one occasion kept us going until the next morning  little bite sized sandwiches are available with various fillings  scones  the best I ve ever tasted  they must have a secret ingredient  and cakes and gateux as well as fresh fruit and local sweets   You can drink as much tea  coffee  coffee machine serving latte  cappacino etc  and cold drinks as you like  but don t try and take them out with you as you will be stopped and asked to drink them in the lounge   Evening there is happy hour  or a couple  and you can drink many different types of alchol with no extra charge Another benefit was the discounted meals and room service within the hotel   All in all I think it was worth the money   The bed was firm and comfy and the pillows too   I suppose the the bathroom was a little small but there again we don t spend all our time in there   When we went to the pool area the staff even layed our towels out on the beds for us and warned us that it would be really busy on the Friday and to get down earlier      ish  they came round at  ish with iced wet face cloths   The staff throughout our stay were excellent often refering to us by name   You can t go wrong with this hotel   If you make a trip to the Gold or Spice Souk and are on a budget catch the Hilton courtesy bus to the Hilton Dubai Creek usually about  pm and then a quick taxi ride from there it will save you a few quid  the return trip from gold souk in the taxi to Jumeirah was about   dirhams     ish    Also it is worth a trip to the Gold and Diamond Park  but please make sure the taxi driver knows where he is going  ours got lost and lost again  Make sure you haggle when you get there and if they won t take less go to another shop after all there are about       We loved this hotel and the food  the location is good with plenty of restaurants and cafes and a few shops on the walk and in the Plaza  up the steps opposite the Hotel   The area is very clean and safe  Have a good time  
P =>   Great location outstanding service We stayed   days at the Hilton with my family last week and can only recommand it  First is the great location as a walking area   the walk  quite unique in Dubai is just at door step with restaurant and shops so that it is very easy to find a place for the diner close by  Second is the staff at this hotel were in really outstanding  It started with a warm welcome in French  Everybody is just striving for making a perfect stay  We stayed on the executive fllor with access to private lounge which worth the extra cost  I can really recomend the upgrade  Concierge very efficiently organize the transfer for airport  complementary if in executive  so you get the Hilton service till you fly  All in all a truly high standard hotel to stay especially for staff customer relations  
P =>   Everything you could possibly need from a hotel Just returned from Dubai and boy what a place a must see for everyone at least once in a lifetime I was so glad we stayed at the Jumeirah Hilton it lived up to every expectation that we had unpretentious friendly clean and amazing service when we booked back in ch we got an early booking     discount on the stay we therefore decided to go for an executive King room which enabled us to use the executive lounge for breakfast afternoon tea and evening drinks Copious amounts of alcohol available between       and       and lovely canapes This is a real bonus When we arrived we was offered an upgrade to a suite on the executive  th floor for an extra      which i gladly said yes to and it was fantastic      inch flat screens   balconys and and a great separate seating area with lovely sea views if like us you like eating and drinking it can be quite expensive as alcohol is only available in restaurants within hotels  but like London there is plenty for all budgets I am glad we went in ust to experiance the    degrees by day and    by night but for us this was too hot as expected the sea being too hot and the evenings too humid but this is Dubai and everywhere is air conditioned so it was not a problem just slap on a high factor and take regular dips in the cooled swimming pool I would not hesitate to return and stay at the Jumeirah hilton however i think ember through to il would be more comfortable in the sun and better for us 
P =>   Hot hot hot   I have just returned from the Hilton after a short break with my husband  This was the  nd time i had been back to the hotel and i must say that nothing has changed  the service is still as good as ever  The staff cannot do enough for you  whether it is pressing the buttons on the lifts for you or bringing you ice cold towels whilst sunbathing  they really do go that extra step The hotel itself is still very good  i once again had an excutive room as it is definitly worth the extra money  For the extra money you get a complimentry pick up from the airport  just contact the hotel to let them know your flight details and they will arrange a car for you   our car was a lovely   series BMW     You have access to the Executive lounge  where you have a buffet breakfast  snacks and drinks all day  afternoon tea  cakes and sandwiches  and then alcoholic drinks and canapes in the evening We did order a couple of mocktails and a portion of chips at the swim up pool and that was nearly       so paying the extra for an excutive room is really worth the money I have been to Dubai a few times now  and this time round was by far and away the hottest time i have been there   temperatures soared well into the    s   I knew it was going to be hot   but this was far too much for me and i love the heat    So if you not great on the heat avoid ust  Overall the hotel is still as great as ever  and if your considering going to Dubai during Ramadan  do not be put off by this   its the  nd time i have been during Ramadan and it didnt effect us one little bit   
P =>   Fab hotel We spent three nights at the Hilton Dubai Jumeriah  The hotel was in a great location  Breakfast was included and was very good  We ate in the South American Restaurant at the hotel  both to food and service was outstanding  The rooms were spacious and very comfortable  Would definately stay again and have recommended to friends family as great value for money  
P =>   A Holiday to remember Stayed at the Hilton with my family last week and the staff at this hotel were in a word Fantastic from the moment Amjad met us at the airport until we were dropped off again every member of the staff were so kind and helpful it was amazing we had booked executive rooms with access to the lounge where Bridget and her staff could not do enough for you i would recomend an upgrade if you can it really is worth the bit extra that you pay All in all a truly brilliant hotel to stay and by far the best for staff customer relations that i have came across while staying in Dubai  
P =>   Fantastic My friend and I stayed here just last week  We both could not fault this hotel  and were extremely happy with our stay here  The staff are absolutely brilliant  nothing is too much trouble and enjoy a good laugh with the guests  During the trip it was my birthday  the staff came up to the room with a birthday cake     Lovely surprise  This hotel also seems to be one of few which offers every room a balcony  Our balcony looked over the bustling street below  No disturbance from noise but great for watching the world go by whilst enjoying a glass of pimms  Would definitely definitely return and would recommend this hotel to anyone with full confidence  Also did not notice any disturbance from building work or demolition at all  
P =>  Loved it  I stayed in this hotel for   nights in y  Before booking I was very wary of the hotels location as it seemed to be very far away from the old city and the airport  but I would not hesitate to book again We arrived late at night and were greeted by the super friendly staff as mentioned in other reviews  We were given a welcome drink and told that the King corner alcove room that we booked allowed us access to the executive lounge  I would really recommend this room to others   two of the room walls were glass and offered panaromic views across the beach   we could even see Atlantis the palm and the Burj al Arab  The executive lounge was an unexpected bonus   it allowed us to have free breakfast  snacks and drinks all day  afternoon tea  and evening alcohol and canapes   and so we feel that we really saved a lot of money by opting for this room The pool and beach areas are pristine  and really need to be seen to be believed  During the day staff come round and offer cold clothes   just what you need to cool you down in the Dubai heat  The location of the hotel really did not end up being a problem at all  taxi prices really are very reasonable  The hotel also runs free coach services to the major shopping malls  make sure you ask about this because it is not advertised anywhere We booked a desert safari trip through the hotel and were able to receive a sizeable discount The staff at the Hilton really make this hotel superb   I do think that it does need a bit of a revamp but still would thoroughly recommend  
P =>  Amazing I travelled to Dubai with my partner just a couple of weeks ago  i bought the holiday for my partner to celebrate her   th birthday  I definitely made the right choice  We arrived at around     am after a night flight   the designated check in time is actually  pm  we were asked to wait in the bar area until our rooms were ready  there was free tea coffee biscuits available in the bar and our rooms were ready within   minutes which was great   The hotel staff are brilliant  they are very friendly  greet you by name which shows how proffessional they are when dealing with an endless amount of guests throughout the summer and they are always on hand to assist you with anything  Krish was very nice i have seen his name mentioned in other reviews as he is so polite and geuinely wants to help you have a fantastic holiday  He reccomended the local arab restaurant  Sarai  to us which we tried and it was lovely  Many of the tourists dodged this charming restaurant in favour of the usual fast food places such as pizza  KFC  starbucks etc   You will also notice how clean the hotel is  it is constantly being cleaned with the greatest amount of attention   The room service staff were also great  the room is cleaned everyday to a high standard and staff leave shells on the end of the bed which is a nice touch  Again even the housekeeping staff remember your name and smile everytime you walk past  This hotel is easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in  for service and staff  It really is very nice and we have stayed in hotels in las vegas and new york which are hard to beat  The facilities are excellent  particularly the pool with a swim up bar  we never got to use this as the pool is always busy  with lots of loungers around  normally there are always spare loungers  You dont need to take towels as you can get some everyday from the towel hut  just throw it into the big towel bin after you use them  The pool area leads down to shaded lounging areas which leads down to the private beach area which is also beautiful  The beach area was never very busy  despite it being so attractive  Again  there are friendly helpful staff there  they will lead you to where you choose to sit  they will put your parasol up or down as you see fit and when they noticed our bottle of water which we were keeping shaded to prevent it from warming up in the blistering heat  they even provided ice and cups  What more could you want from a hotel   The food at breakfast is fantastic  cereals  fruits  continental items such as cheeses  breads  sliced meats  pastries  muffins etc  many cooked breakfast items  fresh juices and an egg station where the chef will prepare you items how you like  Omelettes  fried  poached and boiled eggs  pancakes  waffles etc  We had pancakes with fruit and syrup  delicious  You cannot be dissapointed even if you are the fussiest eater  Even children have a small seperate buffet table with  quot child friendly quot  foods for those fussy children  And there was a  quot Pork station quot  where you can get a fix of bacon and pork sausages that was clearly seperated for muslims  Out of the hotel there are lots of things to do  There are innumerable shopping malls spanning the length of the Sheikh Zayed Road  many of which offer a free shuttle bus from the hotel  something that we took advantage of a few times  All of the malls are a little different   the mall of the emirates is the second largest mall in the world  you will find many things in Dubai that happen to be the largest fastest first of it s kind etc  things in the world   although our favourite mall was the ibn battuta mall which has different zones such as china andalucia etc  Taxis cost around      dirhams        for journeys of around   minutes  The malls all clearly state at the entrance that women should have their shoulders covered and that it is a minimum requirement for men to wear shorts that cover the knees and t shirts that cover the shoulders  in order to respect the muslim culture  However many tourists ignored this and wore vests and strappy tops and showing cleavage  It s up to you how to take it really  if you wish to be respectful  as we were then at least wear baggy shorts and a t shirt and ladies can wear pashminas or cardigans over dresses and tops  You can find all sorts of stores like debenhams  river island  top shop in these malls  they are more expensive than here but this is negated sometimes by the great sales that they have  slashing up to     off of prices in places  But in general the clothes are more dear  Some excursions we took  we booked excursions through our virgin rep  although yuo can easily book through other people  We went on the dune bashing trip followed by a bbq in a desert camp with other bits such as a belly dancer  camel rides  henna tattoos  sheesha smoking etc  great fun and fairly good value  Food was surprisingly good  This set us back roughly     each but it was worth it  the transfer was about an hour each way and the activity from hotel to back lasted approx   hours  fed  watered and entertained  We also did the dubai city tour  which was about     each  The tour guide  KJ  from Japan  was very funny and informative  we actually learned a fair bit about dubai from him  The tour was in a little bus and included stopping at the burj al arab for photos  driving by atlantis for distant photos  literally a drive by camera shot   seeing the palaces in which the sheikh and his brother lives in  a boat ride across the creek in an abra and also visiting the spice and gold souks  where we were hassled by many locals to buy their gold and silver or their fake designer goods   bags  watches  sunglasses etc  We did buy one piece of jewellery after knocking him down by quite alot  I also bought some spices including iranian saffron and madagacan vanilla pods  I spent    on them but that would of run me at least     here in the UK  saffron is very expesive here   At the end of the tour everybody tipped KJ but the poor driver didn t get a penny  We also got a taxi to Atlantis which cost   dirhams  it was well worth the trip to see the aquarium that they have  we got some great photos  There is also a waterpark there which looks amazing but we didn t try it  We were speaking to another couple who stayed at another Hilton which was an hours drive away  they didn t really like the location as it was cut off from lots of things  this hotel was very well located  The Walk area next to the hotel has many shops and restaurants which tends to get busier at night and is very quiet during the intensely hot afternoons    celcius everyday   If you are looking to book for ust the temps are set to rise nearer to    degrees celcius apparently  All in all the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah was fantastic  we have racked our brains to find fault with something  the worst thing i can think of is that the drinks are quite expensive  beer is    a pint  cocktails are about      but as alcohol is banned in many places you can see why  also avoid the minibar and get your drinks at the local shops instead  We put all of the minbar items in the cupboard and put our own bits in there    So book this hotel with confidence that you will have a great time here as we did  
P =>  Wonderful Place to Relax and Unwind An absolutely beautiful hotel and a lovely place to unwind after a period of hard work  Staff in the pool bar were amazing and very friendly  Room was beautiful and had a lovely view of the sea  I would recommend the eggs bendict for breakfast  they were divine  Gorgeous gardens and private part of beach  Also sampled the health spa  massage was nice but felt a little rushed  The only downside to the hotel was the lack of things to do within walking distance  many surrounded by other large hotels and hotels being built  There were no shops etc within walking distance and taxis were a must  that said  it may well have improved since my stay as Dubai changes very quickly  My room was lovely and always clean  it was at a discounted price due to my work but I still feel it was slightly overpriced even at the lower cost  
P =>   Fantasic hotel   amazing stay My first review ever   This was my first trip to Dubai  with my brother  his mate  mam  dad and grandparents  We flew from Newcastle to Heathrow then changed plane for DXB We booked a package deal with Virgin and was veryyyy cheap for    nights in Dubai Hotel  is the best hotel ive ever stayed in  The staff cant do enough for you  They sent a cake up to mam and dads room for their anniversary with a rose and card Every member of staff are fantastic apart from one who work at the pool bar haa Rooms are quite big  although there was   of us in one room    double beds and a single  I requested a sea view and got one  We flew with Virgin arriving into DXB at  ish  we had to wait in the hotel for a good hour before our rooms where readyThey swiped mams and dads card for      AED          But we just paid our room bill on a daily basis  As any   star hotel prices are dear at The Hilton it was       for can of coke        for one pint of larger  and        for cocktails  bull frogs are nice       for a pizza  between   of us we spent        Bad times haEven pulling upto the hotel in a taxi  staff open the door for you  On arrival we were given a fresh pineapple juice at check in Rooms   fresh free water every day  come in handy as the hotel is expensive  On arrival we got   bottles of wine too  We got breakfast in the hotel was served between     am  all sorts to choose from full english  ceral  bread  cakes  pancakes  cheese hamThere is about   restraurants and bars in the hotel to choose from  we just used the pool bar mainly and went to the Sky Bar on the   th floor  very chilled atmospherePool area is fantasic and clean  staff would come round give you cold towls to cool down and slices of watermelon  Beach area is class to  towls are providedSea is boiling wouldnt reconmend for children  I was going to get out at one point Definatly go back to the same hotel  its in a good position situated on the Walk  loads of restraurants and VERY CHEAP  loads of people told us that Dubai was going to be really expensive  i dont think it is just the hotels are  Activites   We went to The Atlantis Hotel waterpark  Ski Dubai  Seawings flight around Dubai at     feet  fantastic    Cruise down the creek   x  driving in the desert  Burj Al Arab for a few drinks  sight seeeing  gold souk and shoppingFor sightseeing we just hired a taxi for   hrs this cost     AED      cheap as chips taxis over there Irish village it good too for meals and a few drinks  cheaper than the hotels Ruby tuesday do nice foodChills was good food The butchers shop and grill  perfect if you like stakes All decent pricesAt the front desk we made good friends with Krish who works on Guest Services he is amazing  he sorted the cruise out for us  at a discounted price  D   always checking how we are doing  got cheaper taxis for us  he just couldnt do enough for us  he even sorted another cake out on the crusie for mam and dadTo save money   Buy a booked called  quot Dubai Entertainer quot  it was     AED  it is full of vouchers   for  s  We saved a fortune   saved money on ski dubai  water parks  pizza hut  BK  KFC  Ruby Tuesday  Chillis  hagen dazs ice cream Well worth it  I bought the book from Virgin in the Mall of Emirates  we saved easy       and still had loads of vouchers left  which we give away  
P =>   Don t check in before   p m   Beware of the unprofessional check in staff  They rigorously enforce a   pm check in time  so don t arrive earlier or you will be forced to pay the standard rate for an extra full night if you want to check in before   p m  They also seem to enjoy your predicament  after all you are not one of their guests at any time before   p m After checked in at       hrs I went to my room  quite nice really  and as my phone sim card didn t like Dubai so much  it was not in a mood to roam  I had to consider using the in room phone  The charge was    dirams per minute  Now  why would anyone do that  So I resorted to using skype  but alas  they were ready to stuff me there also with their WiFi Internet at a cost of    dirams for one hour  So what I do when I get charged so much for essential services is simply not to spend any more money with them  so I can make no comment about the food except that it is of course outrageously expensive  Thre are though plenty of alternatives across the road  There s also a supermarket across the road  then go upstairs  be prepared for a climb  to  The Walk   That is if you need milk for your coffee  the hotel shop has stuffed camels  but no fresh milk for your coffee   The beach is nice enough  but the white sands face the ubiquitous huge cranes in the foreground  there is really no escape in Dubai  and don t walk any more than     meters to the left as a guard asks you  politely  not to go any further  I didn t try to the right  Rooms are very nice  everything all very new  The Swimming Pool is also very good  In general  the area the hotel sits on is excellent if you like that upmarketty  but characterless feel of Dubai  Personally  after having a peek at the world s tallest building  is that including the sticky out bit at the top    the biggest ski slopes in a desert this side of the Sahara  and including the Sahara   the world s most expensive dinner  I missed that actually  but it surely must be there   the world s only ten star hotel  or was it seven   and similar Dubai superlatives  I couldn t wait to leave  
P =>   Perfect resort We stayed  nights in e on the way to Maldives  We were fortunate that our room was ready on arrival early morning as we were exhausted after wedding and over night flight  Room was beautiful  comfortable and they delivered the champane and beautiful cake for our honeymoon cereblation  Breakfast was fantastic and enjoyed so many choice  Pool is in good condition and pool bar was nice  Beach towel were provided on the way to beach and so relaxing and never struggle to find beach chair parasol  Concierge service was superb and lots of restaurant   cafe nearby  Could stay more longer  Top floor lounge was quiet and relaxing  You will never be disappointed by this hotel  
P =>   exellent place me my husband and my    year old daughter stayed here from   th july to   st july      it is one of the best hotel i have ever stayed in the staff are very friendly and we got an exective room facing the sea the breakfast was very good and it was our first trip to dubai but after staying at this hotel it will not be our last and the place where it is all the resturants are there 
P =>   Great Service Hotel property is very nice and good location next to the new ina complex and beachfront  Very typical of Hilton properties around the world in terms of the amenitites  I just wanted to comment on the service  It really is fantastic  Lobby personnel will occasionally greet you by name  Had several things arranged by Concierge and they were great  as well as  the staff in the Executive Lounge  Would defintely come back  
P =>  Great Dubai Hospitality This resort hotel was by far the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in  In Dubai  there is typically excellent service everywhere  and the Hilton is no exception  Location  The down sides are that it is quite far from Dubai Creek and the airport  and right next to a construction site  On the up side  taxis are very cheap  and the beach location is great  Behind the hotel is the pool area  then the garden area  then the private beach Service  Fantastic  You never have to wait for anything  All of the staff are always friendly and more than willing to help Rooms  The rooms are not amazing but do have everything you would expect The building  The building is rather small on a Dubai scale  only    floors  It is dwarved by its high rise neigbours  But that is charmingly refreshing  in a forrest of sky scrapers  We stayed for   days in the middle of summer  when it was too hot to do anything except go to air conditioned shopping malls or lounge around the pool  The Hilton was therefore a good place to stay  The pool area was well serviced by a good bar and restaurant  Shuttles ran reasonably frequently to a number of malls around Dubai  Other restaurants were only a short stroll away  
P =>  Wonderful stay but thin walled and sometimes overcrowded We stayed at this hotel in the first   weeks of e  Since we are HH Gold we expected an upgrade  Unfortunatly the hotel was overbooked so we took the free internet       value for   weeks   Upon identifying ourselves as HH Gold there was a noticable attitude change in the staff  to the possitive The hotel is nice  clean although somewhat outdated  The staff is wonderful and will assist you where ever they can  We had them make some reservations for us for excursions which were done flawlessly  As we have been to Dubai before we knew this is usually the case in this country Food drinks in the hotel are very expensive  we went to the walk most of the time and ate for approx        for    where this is approx the same price of   entree in the hotel This being said  Bice is a great restaurant and was by far the best in our trip  so that was worth the money  The pool is great as are the beach and garden  Plenty of seats  Sat Wed  see below  and not very many people playing the towel game  We brought a couple of bottles of whiskey and bought cans of coke at the supermarket which is a     yard walk from the hotel We only had   problems with the hotel which would make us not return   The rooms are very thin walled  As Arab people tend to be more noisy than others this was quite a problem  This started at approx   PM  at least  it was going on when we returned to the room  and fortunatly they stopped at approx        but before that it was not possible to have a conversation in your own room without yelling  As we value our privacy and quite this is the main reason we would not return to this hotel  We have stayed at other Hiltons and they are much better at sound proofing rooms  In the weekend  Thurday Friday  the hotel sells pool tickets to the locals enableing them to use the Hilton pool  garden and beach  This means that at those   days everything is very very crowded and all chairs with shade are gone by   AM  Since the facilities are not large enough to accomodate all these people everything gets to crowded  We actually saw hotel guests leaving because there were not seat  in our opinion this should NEVER happen and hotel guest should always have prefference  Also the hotel was fully booked so there was no need to sell extra tickets  It should not have been done All in all we had a wonderful stay although we would take one of the other hotels at Jumeirah beach next time  
P =>  absolutely wonderful holiday my best friend and I stayed at the Hilton on Jumeirah beach at the end of e  We wanted to get away and relax in a beautiful location  This hotel was fabulous and well worth the money  We didn t go for an all inclusive deal   we just got the breakfast  more than enough choice at breakfast   inc pancakes  waffles  omlettes  This was the best thing  since the hotel is located on a promenade with restaurant after restaurant after restaurant  these were italian places  mexican  african  thai  indian etc  A meal for both of us usually cost around        Dirhams  There was a small mall bout   mins walk away where u could buy bottled water from for  Dirhams  the hotel is charge much more  The hotel itself is great   the staff are ever so friendy and always there to help you and give you a smile  Our room was kept lovely and clean all the time and towels were changed every day so there wasn t ever any sand from the beach on our floor The pool is lovely  its quite big and there are more than enough sunbeds for everyone  The beach is even better  not crowded in the slightest and we were served ice cold watermelon on the beach mid afternoon  The sea is beautifully clear  They provided all the beachtowels so there was no need to take There are free buses that go to the malls every day   just pick up a timetable from concierge   its easy and drops you right outside the mall  We used this bus to get the the souks as well otherwise out taxi fare would have been hefty my bestfriend and I had the best time ever and came back totally refreshed   
P =>  Fabulous hotel Hotel was lovely and the staff outstanding  Buffet breakfast was very good  Very conveniently situated with lots of restaurants on  The Walk  outside the hotel  Room keptvery clean  Overall a very good choice  
P =>   Great Hotel and wonderful service From the outside it isnt the biggest or most impressive hotel in Dubai  but the rooms were comfortable and the service warm freindly and efficient  The hotel greeted us with free cocktails and allowed us to check in before lunchtime  Conscierge were very helpful in advising us on attractions to visit and overall  the hotel comes strongly recomended We will be back for sure  
P =>   The staff make the place We had a three night stay and the single thread running through our experience was the excellence of the staff at all levels and in all departments  They were all welcoming  friendly and wanting to go out of their way to be helpful  This applied to reception  the doormen  the dining room staff  how many dining room managers remember one s name from one day to the next    the room cleaners  and the garden and pool attendants  The service here speaks volumes for the training the Hilton must give and the high standards expected and faultlessly achieved  Our esperience endoresed all that we had researched beforehand on Tripadvisor  
P =>   Second Time here won t be the last  This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel  and if anything it improved the second time round  The staff are a credit to the business  the whole hotel is spotless and it really did make our holiday  We stayed in the executive lounge  which was brilliant  The rooms on our floor     had been refitted very recently  and to a very high standard  The beach is private and very clean with a good range of watersports if you like that kind of thing I would recommend this hotel to anyone who just wants to kick back and relax One tip I would give though  drinks in the hotel are very expensive  as in all hotels in Dubai but there is a duty free shop just outside arrivals in the airport  Buy a bottle  then when you go to one of the malls  or the Jumeriah Beach residences there are supermarkets  Cans of tonic in the hotel are Dhs     You get six cans for Dhs   in carrefour  Also the water     ltr is Dhs    in hotel  Buy a six pack from the supermarket of less than Dhs   a bottle  That way when you splurge on the shopping malls  you will know you have a least saved a fair bit on the drinks   
P =>   Excellent hotel great location on beach and near shops and restaurants Stayed here for   nights at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach in early e Overall would say this was an excellent choice of hotel  The facilities are good  service is exceptional  and location is great Rooms  These are of a good standard  clean and large  We had a double room  with   large double beds  a balcony with a lovely sea view  Large widescreen tv with several English language channels  Nice large bathroom with shower  Regulalry cleaned to a high standard Food  Breakfast buffet was included in our booking  Had a very large selection of food  from fruits and salads  to breads and croissants  and fried cooked items  including fresh pancakes and eggs  There are a few restaurants and bars at thh hotel  including a pool bar  The room service is reasonable  food tasty and arrived quick  Lovely   th floor balcony bar Facilities  Numerous restaurants  bars  gym which is free to use  A large pool with small childrens  pool  and privat beach with free towels  shower  changing room and sun lounges Service  Exceptional and faultless all the way Location  Excellent  right on the beach and nearby is  quot The Walk quot  which has numerous restaurants to cater for most tastes  supermarket  coffee shops and general shops Others  Free shuttles to various shopping malls around Dubai  Free internet at the business centre  
P =>   excellent staff and hotel   credit card annoyance though just come back from dubai and th hilton was amazing  the staff are amazing and do anything and everything for you  almost making you feel guilty  the breakfast was amazing  best ive had in all my travels  every day something new to try and so much variety amazing  the hotel was clean  spacious  pool was small though  who needs a pool when you have the beach though right on the doorstep  the walk where all the restaurants are i thought was over hyped  its nice place with good food but only busy on friday and saturday night as thats dubais weekend  apart from that its pretty dead  the gym and steam room weere excellent indulgance  again great staff working on that floor  paid    dirhams to use the net for half hour  offered tea cofee for free whilst surfing net so ok  NOW heres my one and only gripe and its a big one and i see from previous reviewer im not only one  as soon aqs i checked in i was asked for CREDIT card  i asked why and they said they needed it in case i spent something whilst in hotel or mini bar and i could use this as credit  i told them i would pay cash as i use this if i used anything but they said i had to pay this amount on a card  now i wasnt told this when i booked the holiday and it may not be an issue to most but as a working    yr old i have a budget and wasnt happy to use my card for no reason as i had paid for my stay anyway  I didnt have my credit card so used my switch card but was told i would get the money back at end in cash in dirhams  i knew when i returned to the UK i would lose money when i convert it and they said i still hd to do this  anyway this meant i lost out on     for which would of bought something nice in dubai  that is my only issue  i think they want ppl to use the mini bar  drinks in bars etc and keep putting it on this tab and then making ppl spend money which is wrong  i should have the choice to spend cash or not and this did put me in a bad mood and is now when i think i got robbed of        which may not seem much but principles matter to me  apart from that dubai is amazing  still work in progress but great stay  the workers have to be nicest peple i have ever met  worth it just to meet great people  
P =>   Great stay highly recommended  Location is excellent  staff first rate  room fantastic  beach  amp  pool area amazing  This was a perfect spot to wind down for a few days after working in Abu Dhabi and heading home  I really can t wait to bring my family back to this resort  The guys who are working out on the beach greeting and seating you deserve an extra pat on the back for working as hard as they do in the heat  always running to take care of requests  
P =>   As good as the Burj Al Arab  Having stayed at the Burj Al Arab hotel   times I didn t have very high expectations of the Hilton Jumeirah  how wrong I was  the hotel is lovely  simple and unpretentious  we had an executive suite which I must say the pictures on their website dont do it justice  OK it wasn t any where near as opulent as the Burj but speaking from someone who has very high standards when it comes to hotel rooms thought it was very nice indeed  We had a slight misunderstanding at check  in but the assistant front desk manager Mr Ali Nader kindly agreed to my request and it was sorted promptly  The exec rooms are a must just for the access to the exec lounge alone  free breakfast  afternoon tea and snacks in the evening as well as free alcoholic drinks between   and     pm and believe me I can can eat for England but I can honestly say if you were on a tight budget you could easily live on the food in there for the whole holiday As I said previously the hotel is really nice  the grounds are lovely  better than the Burj   the hotel is spotlessly clean  the staff are all wonderful right down to the cleaning boy who greeted me by name every day  All in all we had a great time at the Hilton Jumeirah  my husband and I both agreed it was one of the best holidays we ve had and we ve stayed at some very nice hotels including the Conrad Hilton in the maldives  superb  and the Banyan tree in the Seychelles  beautiful  along with   times at the Burj Al Arab  amazing   I tell you this not to brag but to explain how I feel  you can pay all the top prices for all the top hotels but sometimes its the simple things in life that are the best   totally unpretentious and a quarter of the price  We will definately go back  
P =>   Excellent hotel for young families We ve stayed here many times over the last few years  and keep going back  Its a well managed  very friendly hotel  where the staff are courteous and cannot help you enough  We have   very young children   who loved the pool area  the beach can get a bit hot in the early part of the day   A kids  club and a pretty decent gym are an added bonus  There are plenty of restaurants in the area  and a few supermarkets  If you want some R  amp  R   a great place to chill    
P =>   Great hotel right at the beach and The Walk at Dubai ina This Hilton is great  Not to get me wrong it is not very luxurious  but it is a good solid Hilton quality  But the service quality is outstanding  Every member of the staff trys the best to make your stay unique and memorable  The pool and the beach is very nice and you always find a place to lay down  The hotel is also right at The Walk  what is a nice district with a lot of local and international restaurants  
P =>   Estacy I stayed with my wife in Executive suite  The Executive lounge and the employees in the lounge have paid extreamly great hospitality  Enjoyed the Sauna  Swimming pool  Beach restarunt  Lobby  Outside wake way  Envirinment  I can name anything in this hotel is of superb quality  Enjoyed my   nights at apex  
P =>   Loved this Hotel  We stayed for a week  amp  found the hotel to be excellent  Spotlessly clean  with very helpful staff  Great Beach too It s in a great location on the beach  amp  on  quot The Walk quot  which meant there were restaurants  amp  shops on the doorstep  Alcohol is expensive in hotels but not really anymore than any other city  BICE bar has amazing rooftop views of the area  the Studio bar will keep any sports fans amused  although the TV is largely US UK channels anyway   Most of the restaurants in the area only serve soft drinks  By your alcohol in the Duty free at the Airport once you ve cleared Customs  Yes there is building work nearby but then Dubai is a huge building site  however don t let that put you off you can t stay in big fancy hotels until they ve been built  The work did not affect our stay at all  maybe twice we heard something from the building site but we had no complaints Internet access is chargeable in the hotel so nip over the room to one of the   Starbucks nearby as it s free WIFI  
P =>  Oasis amongst the cranes Dubai is one large building site  One single road stretching as far as the eye can see with new buildings on either side  a competition between them to build a higher  funkier  more exotic quirky shape  In the midst of all of this there is an oasis of calm that is the Hilton Jumeriah  It is a small low lying hotel in a fantastic beach front location  It is being renovated at the moment  Service is good  breakfast was included in our eBookers rate  We had a room on the  nd floor  we could just see the sea and the lights of the Palm and the Atlantis resort in the distance  The main benefit of the Hilton is that it is actually at the only location in Dubai that seems to have a bit of character  albeit brand new  and where you can actually walk outside  The  Walk  is a pedestrian area  full of restaraunts and shops  for people spotting and Ferrari driving poseurs  There is an excellant Lebanese restaurant to the left as you leave the hotel  on the corner of the first junction   called Sirai  sp    and   Starbucks with easy distance The hotel has a large pool  and a great beach side bar for bbqs and watching football Dubai is horribly expensive now  You can only drink alcohol in hotels  The rooftop biceBar is worth a visit  you go up the hidden elevators the exit to the pool  unfortunately they allow smoking inside but the view is good  I would happily recommend the Hilton J and would return 
P =>  Exotic The place is exotic and worth spending the time 
P =>  Great Hotel  Service was out of this world  Stayed here for   nights during the last week of   with my wife and our   year old daughter  We got a great rate for flights and hotel and as soon as we walked in  we were treated so nicely  They gave our daughter lots of little puzzles  crayons etc etc and she was happy  and all throughout our stay  the service was incredible The sea facing room on the sheraton side  made sure we didn t get a view of the demolition of the hotel next door  and the view was very nice Breakfast was plentiful and the location of the hotel was ideal for us  with the beach and pool being used everyday  and the  walk  being useful for  emergency  food  had a nice gym  overlooking the beach  room service was fairly priced for those times we didn t want to go out for lunch  The restaurants were overpriced i felt  but the food may ve been worth it for all i know  And they had a great kids club where my daughter wanted to go everyday The staff were all  so friendly and helpful  that it made our holiday even nicer I have nothing bad to say about this hotel  we all wish we were still there  
P =>  Would Recommend    A short   day break for us  we live in Saudi  and it s a refreshing change to be able to drink alcohol and be able to eat pork and for ladies not to wear an abaya  We booked through dubairesorts and this included a pick up at the airport  very efficient   We booked two executive rooms and as my husband has a Hilton loyalty card we were allocated rooms with fantastic sea views  The positives   housekeeping is wonderful and the staff are so pleasant  There s a great choice of restaurants  yes  at a price   location good too  especially now that The Walk has opened across the way   although you don t want to be walking too far when it s    deg C and humidity is in the high     range  The negatives   the pool is barely large enough for the number of residents   we stayed at Le Royal Meridien last year  even pricier  and they have a choice of   pools which spreads the bodies about so to speak  Whilst we were staying at The Hilton there seemed to be a few people with the  quot bag a sunlounger quot  mentality  They would grab the lounger at the crack of dawn  plonk their towel and one or two personal items and then disappear for most of the day   very selfish  That s nothing to do with the hotel  just the mentality of the guests  It meant that few sunloungers were available anywhere near the pool  in the garden area  by about      am  By mid afternoon don t expect to be able to swim   most people are just wallowing in the coolness of the pool because the sea is too hot The hotel says it has a dress code   fair enough   but we never saw this enforced  One evening a young girl came into the restaurant  Oceana  dressed in very skimpy shorts which left nothing to the imagination  Whilst having afternoon tea in the exec lounge a  quot lady quot  arrived wearing a black bikini which you could see underneath a white cheesecloth cover all  barely covered her backside   If you are going to have  quot dress codes quot  then at least enforce them or don t bother at all  Mind you  Dubai says it doesn t like ladies wearing strappy tops and shorts in public  but you see plenty of them in the malls  Some day soon there s going to be a clamp down or backlash against this  quot western quot  style as it is offensive to muslims   eg  unmarried couples having sex on the beach and being drunk in public   totally unacceptable  It s their country we should respect their culture  Too many Brits think they can go away and continue to behave as if they were in Blackpool I used the hairdresser whilst I was there   wouldn t necessarily recommend him   he didn t listen to what I asked him to do and it cost    Dhiram for the cut and a further    Dhiram for the blow dry   only so I could go back to my room and do it all again  
P =>   Nice but you pay for for it We recently spent   nights at The Hilton Jumeriah  We were lucky as we booked it as part of an Expedia promotion and only paid      each for flights and five nights B n B  The Hilton is truly a very nice hotel  with great service and its right opposite a parade of shops and restaurants  no bars   sore point this amongst ex pats in Dubai     known as The Walk  The restaurants on The Walk were crucial to our stay because our only criticism of The Hilton would be that as far as eating and drinking goes The Hilton prices are just extortionate     Dirham s for a pint of Heineken  that s    a pint        and    for a can of coke  A bar snack at lunchtime will cost you at least     and evening meal prices start at about     each without drinks  Now we have been to Dubai before and so were not expecting budget Costa prices but neither were we expecting to pay more than one might in Monaco  Many other guests also thought the prices were an insult and made their feelings known by going across the road to the Al Mahar supermarket and buying food there and quite openly eating it within the grounds of the hotel in front of the management  We suspected that many of the Hilton guests were business travellers and some one else is picking up the bill  If they halved the prices more people would eat and drink there and they would probably make more money  We ate at both the new Atlantis Palm and the always great Jumeriah Beach Hotel and both were cheaper than the Hilton  Beer is a mere    a pint at The Jumeriah Beach hotel but you have to get a cab there but cabs are refreshingly cheap and plentiful in Dubai  The only problem with the restaurants at The Walk is that nowhere serves alcohol but you can get a good meal for two for around           including soft drinks or much less      if you go to KFC which is useful for lunchtime Dubai is changing all the time and it is now a great city but the afternoon heat can get a bit much and this was only   It got to   C one afternoon and it will get hotter in e  y and ust  The new shopping malls are a great place to escape the afternoon heat  Locals say the best time to be in Dubai is between ember and ch when it tops out at around a more bearable   C  The cab fare from the airport to the Hilton hotel is currently about     which is not bad for a    minute ride    mile ride  
P =>   Excellent Hotel We stayed at the Hilton for   nights in  and had a wonderful stay  The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly  the hotel was always clean  the housekeeping service was of great standard and we just really couldn t find a bad word to say about the hotel We upgraded to an executive room which I would definitely recommend    well worth the extra money for all the food and drink you get   particularly as alcohol is very expensive in Dubai  we had a few free drinks in the executive lounge first and then went out to eat afterwards  Brian and his team in the executive lounge went out of their way to make sure everything was ok  it was a lovely friendly atmosphere As for the hotel location  it was perfect right on the beach for a bit of relaxation and a great location for the evening   make sure you go out and explore  The Walk  in the evening just outside the hotel  it s full of shops and lovely restaurants and the restaurants are much cheaper than those in the hotels  A lot of hotels are right on the main roads in Dubai and it is not possible to walk out in the evenings but this location is perfect for a wander out  which we really liked  The hotel is a little way from the main centre of Dubai but only a short taxi ride and taxi s are so cheap out there  it is really easy to get around  Plus there is a free shuttle bus service to the main malls from the hotel All in all  we had a wonderful time in Dubai and could not fault the Hilton   would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>   Ok hotel well away from the action The Hotel is located at the end of jumeirah beach and is away from the main attractions of dubai  I will choose a hotel that is closer to the city next time  
P =>   Outstanding Hotel I was here on vocation and really enjoyed this hotel  The staff was excellent and the service was great  It is a little far but it was still good  I would stay here again  
P =>   Fantastic hotel with great beach facilities Stayed at the Hilton for   nights with a friend  We were pleasently surprised  The room was airy and spacious with a view of the beach  just ignore the hotel which is half way thru being knocked down  Cannot fault the staff at all  they couldn t have done more for us  We enjoyed using both the beach and pool areas    even managed to get a great table for the big Champions League semi finals which were shown on huge screen in the pool bar  I opted for an amazing spa treatment which included a chocolate scrub and fully body massage   highly recommended   The shisha was excellent too  I will definately being staying here again when i visit Dubai later this year  Def good value for money  
P =>   Nice hotel great resort just not as good as others Nice hotel and the pool  beach is wonderful  however the service is not quite what you would expect from a hilton in Dubai  however the beach bar is perfect for a quick meal  beer or watching the game   would stay here again but not as good as others  Also a lot of building work going on next door but not a major issue  
P =>   Baeutiful hotel Lovely hotel  on the beach with really good swimming pool and great breakfast  
P =>   Fantastic Location My husband and I stayed at the Hilton  Jumeirah Beach as part of my   th birthday celebrations  We had been to Dubai about   or   years previously and stayed at LeRoyal Meridain Beach Resort and Spa just a few hotels along  Firstly  we couldn t get over the changes in Dubai since our last visit  what a place  Jumeirah Beach area had developed into a really busy place with loads of shops and restaurants  definitely the place to stay in Dubai  The Hilton hotel was great  not as luxurious as Le Royal Meridian but I think that came down to the Hilton being older  We had a corner executive room with two walls of glass over looking the beach   amazing views  Unfortunately the hotel next door  Oasis Beach Hotel  was being demolished whilst we were there so there was a bit of noise from that if you were outside but they were making pretty quick progress on that  The food and staff were fantastic  My husband had an ear infection whilst we were there  The staff had him up seeing the staff doctor within minutes and she arranged for us to visit the local hospital   phone call in advance meant that we had very little time to wait and he was seen by an ENT specialist  you d have to wait weeks for the NHS to do that  My parents were in Dubai at the same time  They stayed at the Hilton in the city and although it was cracking  its really no patch on the location of being at Jumeirah Beach Only disappointing this was due to the poor exchange rate of the pound  Dubai was quite expensive this time round  especially alcohol  
P =>  Super Service with a smile    at the Hilton Jumeirah  Just got back from a lovely week at the Hilton Jumeirah  Hotel is beautifully located directly on the beach and on the other side of the hotel you have what they call  quot the Walk quot  a promenade with lots of restaurants and expensive shops boutiques  Tip  climb those stairs  yes its hot  and find a great supermarket that sells everything you need and avoid paying the ridiculous hight prices for drinks at the hotel  Ok so that is one negative and probably the only one I have to mention about this hotel  prices of drinks in particular are too high  If it would be slightly cheaper  people would spend much more on drinks in the lobby or at the beach  A lobby by the way that I really liked because of the beautiful flowers and colourful chairs and a huge colourful carpet We booked a King Corner Alcove room at a discount rate on the Hilton website because we booked three months in advance and also paid     in advance  I would strongly recommend that you do that as the discount is huge  I have never seen a room this big with such a great view before  Oceanview everywhere you look through the huge ceiling to floor windows  The balcony was twice as big as well compared to the other balconies There were bathrobes and beachslippers in the room when we arrived  We didnt even need our own beachslippers  Bathroom is sufficient but a bit small and tv is not flatscreen and DVD player yet    The Expedia website will tell you that there is a DVD player in the room but that is not true  only the suites have one  You can however pay for a DVD player having set up in your room at a   or   euro fee  Compared to the Hilton Creek  stayed there over New Year in a big corner room  room furniture is a bit dated but the size and the view make up for it And then there is the superfriendly staff that seems to smile all the time and they ll just try to do anything to make you re stay even better Another tip  book a room with executive lounge access  It will give you a great breakfast  super afternoon tea and     hours of happy hour at night with snacks and wine or beer Considered how expensive soft drinks  are at the hotel  this is a good investment If I d came back in the future  I would definately stay at this hotel again  but it would have to be in a King Corner Alcove room again as the other rooms are nice but nothing special  
P =>  great beach hotel  Stayed here on a stopover for  nights Location is on the beach in the furthest part of Jumeirah if coming from the airport   be aware of traffic for timing trips to from airport Staff very welcoming arrived at  am early check in wasn t a problem   as was organizing late checkout    Hotel is  quot old in Dubai terms quot  but very well maintained  Pool area was relaxing and bar staff very attentive and friendly  Beach area every clean and service again prompt  The restaurants at the hotel were very good but pricey  Great little sports bar also  Room decent sized and well appointed  Nice little balcony  enjoyed sitting out at dusk overlooking the sea drinking a beer   which I had picked up some beer on arrival in the airport  as the same Heineken cans from the minibar were way overpriced    All in all couldn t complain and very good value for money  As long as you are not expecting a brand new glitzy    tower bock then you won t be disappointed  There is a new complex with restaurants and shops at your doorstep which is handy  Free bus to mall of the emirates souks but cheap cabs were readily available outside the hotel Will definitely come back here as the atmosphere wasn t hectic and other quests were very pleasant and undemanding  
P =>   Exxcellent hotel We stayed at the Hilton as part of our honeymoon in il       We found the hotel clean  tidy with very friendly staff  The rooms were clean and very comfy  we had a side view of the beach  The breakfast buffet had lots of choice with fresh honey straight off the honeycomb  If you use the restaurant in the afteroon or evening the hotel do expect you to wear long trousers and a collar  The hotel is idea if you wish to visit the areas around the beach and the local water sports but if you wish to visit the Dubai Gold Souk s  The Creek and the local shopping malls use the free hotel courtesy bus which run on a regular basis to and from these locations  An excellent hotel in an excellent location  
P =>   Great hotel with a great location Stayed here for   nights   excellent service and immaculate hotel the staff couldn t do enough to help   Breakfast was fantastic buffet with everything you need and eggs to order from the hot plate  Room service as well complimentary fruit and wine which we thought was a nice touch to our stay   we received an e mail to say they were demolishing a hotel next door which wasn  t too noisy Jumeirah beach is a great location walk out the hotel and have about a     mile walk with restaraunts and shops and watch the exotic cars pose along the road  Only    min from downtown Dubai maybe      DRMs         in a taxi ideal  
P =>   Fantastic for honeymoon  After a week in Komandoo in the Maldivea  amazing  we arrived in Dubai for one week  We stayed   nights in hilton Dubai Creek which was great but lacked that holiday feelilng   we transered with ease to the Hilton Jumeriah for   nights  Amazing hotel   star service  We had booked an executive room but were upgraded to a suite when we told them we were on honeymoon  An amazing room with views of the sea  the palm and the burj al arab  Staff are certainly amazing  great resturaunts  and breakfast buffet  A super location also as you can just go wander down the Jumeriah walk at night and its just buzzing with holiday atmosphere  Our room was arranged with honeymoon ddecorations on the bed one night  and another night we arrived back to the room to find a lovely cake and bottle of bubbly waiting for us also   Great hotel  also has lovely gardens with sun loungers  lovely pool outdoors with swim up to pool bar  and private stretch of beach    would highly recommend it  
P =>   Excellent Hotel     star service Excellent hotel in prime location on Jumeriah Beach  with many restaurants and shops on the door step    not to forget the great beach Certainly worth upgrading to an executive room for the free airport shuttle as well as happy hour between  pm       pm The staff were extremely friendly and made the stay extra special Some contruction  demolition works nearby however this didn t affect our stay in any way  
P =>  Brillant  again  Second visit to this hotel and decided to upgrade to the executive option  this is very worthwhile as previous travellers suggested Excellent staff  and facilities  One tip     If you are going to buy any gold  etc from the gold souk then go to a shop in Gold Land  a few hundred metres along from the souk  On the second floor you will find Ausie Mikes    he s not an ozzy Long story   ask for raymond or Micheal  this shop was recomended by our son who is in the forces  and is very popular with visiting navies from around the globe becuase of the turnover he keeps his prices very marginal and so excellent value  for eg  i bought the mrs a diamond ring for        i got it valued in the u k at        earings       valued at       plus others  The gold souks can be a bit daunting if you go in blind  but these chaps are first class  mention the retired uk police officer and they will look after you  Back to the Hilton  like it so much we are going back on the executive package in       she aint getting no more from ozzy mikes tho   
P =>  Excellent Hotel My wife and I have just returned from a   day stay at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach resort  The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff very friendly and helpful  It was our first trip to Dubai and we had heard standards were very high and the Hilton did not disappoint in any way  Our room on the  th floor was large and very clean  The hotel is situated next to the newly opended Jumeirah Beach Walk which contains lots of shops and restaurants  The hotels facilities are very good the gardens well kept and it has easy access to the beach which again is spotless  There are plenty of sunbeds and the service around the pool and gardens is good  
P =>  The hotel staff were ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT         Our holiday in dubai was fabulous  but our service at the hotel was even better     Which made the holiday unforgetable  Because we experienced such exceptional customer service at the hotel we have decided to book there again  when we return  There is a hotel being demolished next door but we didn t even notice it  All the staff were very polite and very pleasant and helpful  The location is right in the heart of Jumeirah and there are lots of restaurants within walking distance  A big thankyou to all the staff at the Hilton well done    
P =>   wonderful escape My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Jumeriah for   nights in ch  It was a wonderful hotel  The staff were very pleasent  making sure that we were happy with everything  We had a very early check in  but they ensured that we were only waiting    minutes and provided us with tea and biscuts in the meantime  Room service was excellent  breakfast was excellent  and the Cuban   Brazilian restuarant there was our favourite The hotel has a private beach area  nice swimming pool  wonderful garden area in between the pool and beach for people to sunbathe or just relax  If I go back to Dubai  which hopefully I will someday    I would definetly stay at the Hilton again  The only drawback is that it was a quite pricey       USD per night for a room with seaview  
P =>   Very Good Hotel Very good hotel Very impressive all round service  friendliness  helpfulness and we needed medical assistance from the nurse   both resident nurses excellent care  Very good taxi availability and accessibility  Great advice within hotel on touring local sights Traveller s tip on diningFood pricey but plenty and variety of nearby eating places to choose from  
P =>   Great choice we weren t disappointed Dubai wasn t somewhere we d usually choose as a holiday destination  but I was   months pregnant and we wanted somewhere easily accessible from the UK  with a bit of luxury and good weather  We weren t disappointed  Having researched many hotels in Dubai  we chose the Hilton based on great reviews and a recommendation from a friend We arrived from the airport early in the morning   am  and although our room wasn t ready we checked in and headed to the beach while we waited for the room to become available  We were given a room a couple of hours later  The first room we were given unfortunately had a view of the hotel next door which is being knocked down  not the prettiest of sites so we quickly asked to move and the hotel courteously obliged  All very quick and efficient  Our next room was on the other side of the hotel looking out onto The Walk  the newly completed strip of shops and restaurants  and also the beach  it got the evening sun which was great when having a drink out on the balcony  We had booked through lastminute com on a room only basis  not wanting to pay what we felt to be high prices for the hotel breakfast or executive option   Room only suited us perfectly as it meant we could eat in the many cafes and patisseries along The Walk or buy a few bits from the local supermarket which was always stocked with fresh fruit  yoghurts  cakes and breads etc  My husband also brought beer at Dubai airport and kept it in the room fridge   a much cheaper option than buying from the hotel We ate at the hotel a couple of times  once at the pool restaurant which was quite disappointing and then again at BICE which was excellent The Hilton Jumeirah is a great hotel set in one of the few areas of Dubai which seems to have completed its building works so it was relatively peaceful  It had a nice pool area  although it doesn t get much sun due to it being sheltered by all the tall buildings synonymous with Dubai   but the beach has ample sun loungers  although be warned   it got noticeably busier at the weekend   you ll need to get to your sun lounger early    There are pretty landscaped gardens with loungers and seating areas  The gym was great and had state of the art equipment  Staff were all attentive and courteous  Our room was spotless with nice Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries A great hotel which I d definitely recommend  
P =>   good hotel but few problems checked in at      but the room wasnt ready so i had to wait almost an hour to get my room  i travel     times a year but this is first time that i had to wait  especially checking in after  pm  and the hotel is very busy  i mean very very busy  every where you go theres people around you  and it do gets annoying after while  i went to the beach but i can t hardly find empty sunbeds  staff and breakfast is very good but if you want a place to relax and enjoy the beach this is not the right hotel for you  
P =>   Great Beach Location with plenty of Restrauants close by We decided to book this hotel  after reading many other good reviews from trip advisor  and wasn t dissappointed  We upgraded to the Executive package  well worth it   as it included Airport transfers  breakfast and access to the executive lounge on the  th floor where you can enjoy light refreshments all day  afternoon tea with cakes between             and alcoholic drinks between             with a light finger buffet Staff were very accomadating  as we arrived on a very early morning flight  and usually rooms aren t available until      hrs  however  they offered us breakfast  and just after that our rooms were ready  about  hrs early        Fantastic after a long flight from Bangkok Breakfast was good  with plenty of choice  and staff very helpful The pool and beach area gets very busy  but there s always lots happening from a choice of watersports  to beach volleyball or just people watching on the grassed shady areas  The beach bar has live premeirship football  but don t over indulge in drinking beer  in can be very expensive  about       per pint and a bucket of   corona beers were     There appears to be a good choice of food available in the evening from Italian to South american cuisine  but we chose to venture outside the hotel  and explore  THE WALK  which is a combination of snack bars  restaurants and good shops with plenty of choice   just remember they all serve soft drinks only  When we plan to head east again  we will definitely be booking this hotel again Previous reviews mentioned building work close by  yes there is  but after    minutes you get use to it  but Dubai in general is a major building project  
P =>   Exceeded expectations with impeccable service and standards The HDJ was the perfect place to stay and we will be staying there again because of it s excellent level of service and high standards  not to mention the superb location  with The Walk on your doorstep  and prime spot on the beach  The breakfast was tasty and had choices galore and staff were very polite and professional  especially MM   Upgrading booking an executive floor room is highly recommended not only for happy hour but for tea and scones too Our room was spotless and had spectacular sea views  The HDJ offers it s guests FREE use of the internet to check e mails in their business centre and the BiCE Skybar on the top floor is well worth checking out for it s stunning views of The Palm We visited Atlantis on The Palm and spent the day at Aquaventure  but it s very out of the way  as is the Burj Al Arab  and really expensive for non guests at the hotel   for two adults it cost over      for the day s waterpark entrance  The water slides themselves are exceptional but it is overpriced and The Palm beach sand quality is definitely not as nice as Jumeirah beach sand where the HDJ is located The desert safari is also a must do activity in Dubai and there are several tour reps around the hotel who can organise the day s trip for you effortlessly  Sand dune driving was fun and exciting and the BBQ dinner is of the highest quality The malls are plentiful  Dubai Mall in particular was great because of the huge aquarium  but be warned   they are very expensive to shop in and some shops are even more expensive than those in the UK The Madinat souk was the most chic and up market souk around and remember not to seem over eager in the new gold souk because the vendors latch on very quickly and it s hard to get out of the shop and even more difficult just to browse The HDJ has regular FREE shuttles to and from most malls and souks so it s worth taking advantage of them and getting a taxi back as they are very cheap Finally  dining out was not too expensive although alcohol is pricey   we recommend trying the indian restaurants there  The HDJ restaurant food is worth experiencing because of it s high quality and wonderful presentation   go on  treat yourselves  We rate the HDJ   stars plus  
P =>   Simply superb  As     of the reviews are positive  our expectations were high and yet we were amazed at the top class service and facility  friendly and helpful staff  spotless private beach with ample sun loungers  you don t need to fight over them  Lifegurads get them and spread the towel on them for you    clean and bright rooms  you do hear traffic noise if you open the patio door    well  equipped gym  reasonably priced spa and the executive lounge  Oh  what can I say about the excutive lounge  Charming and very helpful Iman and the team made sure that me and my daughter enjoy the fabulous breakfast  afternoon tea with freshly baked scones and snack  happy hour drink with cold and hot canapes in the evening to the full literally  We didn t need to eat out at all  It is such a good value for money  highly recommended  Executive plan also includes return airport transfers  excective check in  even  am we had our first breakfast within   minues of our arrival to the hotel   help with your travel arrangement    the list goes on and on  I can t wait to go back there when the Walk  the first outdoor shopping mall in Dubai  is completed  I was so pleased to have chosen Hilton Jumeirah and not the ones on the other side of the Walk as it is much noisier and dustier  The demolition next door was nothing compared to downtown  At Hilton Jumeirah  you get this relaxing beach holiday feeling  I was so refreshed even though our stay was just for the long weekend that I went back to work on Monday straight from Heathrow with a beaming smile like the Hilton staff  
P =>   Nice Hotel   great location good service BUT VERY EXPENSIVE   nights booked through lastminute comFriendly staff  good service  always cleaning and it s spotless  good choice of restaurants beach bar is great as is the steak restaurant with excellent food BUT prices are crazy   drinks are more expensive than Atlantis on the Palm where we went one evening Hilton prices  water on the beach    per bottle  BBQ dish        Watersports and boat trip booked through the hotel are VERY expensive     mins water skiing is     compared plus you have to wade out to the boat with your skis and haul yourself onto the boat with no help offered Breakfast is excellent with a huge choice to suit everyone a great start to the day Excellent well equiped gym We all enjoyed our   days here  Dubai has become very expensive  For example on departure from heathrow I looked at a pair of Chanel sunglasses cost       in Harvey Nichols in Mall of the Emirates they cost           Even the sales assistant in Gucci said when we compared rpces   quot It is more expensive than London quot  I appricaiate that the exchange rate has changed but gone are the days of having a great shopping experiance in Dubai I dread to think how much a week here would cost with a family  I know a lot of other people have complained about the construction   the building being demolised next door  There is hardly any noise  yes it is ugly but that is part of staying in Dubai 
P =>   Very pleasant and full fill all your expectations I m completely satisfied with the Hilton Jumeirah  Its both a business hotel and a leisure hotel in the way you get the high business service along with the cosy resort  You will find everything you are looking for and the service is briliant  The hotel itself is perhaps a little bit outdated  but the people and the service carry great weight  We had a King Corner room with was fantastic with a direct view of the beach and acess to the executive lounge  The breakfast buffet in the lounge comes with serveral options  compared to the executive lounge breakfast at Hilton Dubai Creek  and I m happy we didn t paid extra for included the Hilton breakfast buffet in the rate  Location is perfect with the own beach and life security guard wich really took good care about the Hilton guests   no others was allowed to be or pass the beach  wich had their own camels   Just around the corner you have several shops and coffee places  The Spa was nice and the staff friendly  however   it was not fancy and had boring surroundings  The restaurant BiCE was very disappointing  Lack of service and over priced  A real shame  We had room service once wich was much better and good valued  The buffet restaurant is also good  standard Hilton   
P =>   Relax in luxury and be spoilt with service This was a  quot treat yourself to luxury quot  holiday for my wife and myself  having both taken early retirement in       We wanted   star and got it We normally like to stay at places where there aren t many people  so this was a change for us as Dubai is a very heavily developed city with far more than its fair share of skyscrapers  plus the current world s tallest building  However the hotel and its own private beach made up for it  The service was first class and nothing was too much trouble for the large number of excellently trained staff  The ratio to guests was more than adequate  We had travelled on a  quot red eye quot  overnight from Heathrow and our room was not ready when we arrived  so we waited    minutes with free drinks coffee laid on  The HIlton is only    floors high  unlike the surrounding blocks which go up to    storeys or more  TIP    Even numbered rooms tend to be facing the car park and beach  preferable  Odd numbered ones also tend to be facing the beach but take in the demolition of the hotel adjacent Food was very expensive  Even if you were only utilising the hotel buffet it was abolut     each  There is a  Ruby Tuesday  restaurant on the Walk   food good and reasonably priced  There s also a KFC if you re desperate  and the prices there are about the same as in UK The pool is adequate  but invariably in the shade  Sounds good in theory for a hot country but there was a strong wind generally coming off the sea which made it pretty cool when you came out of the pool  Sun loungers all over the place  we tended to favour the beautifully manicured grass terracing but there must be over     loungers on the private beach  which is swept every evening There were plenty of touristy things to do for the week that we were there  but we limited ourselves to the helicopter flight over the city The Palm The World  Not cheap   about      each for half an hour but an unforgetable experience  We passed on dolphin watching and safari   been there  done that Cosmina on customer services was great But then   the hotel was great too   
P =>   Astounding East meets West Holiday We spent   nights at The Hilton Jumeriah  It was a wonderful hotel  exceptionally clean and comfortable  the pool areas and gardens to the private beach were superb  Booking the Executive level is a must as Dubai is extremely expensive  The Happy Hour  which is actually two  amp  a half hours long  saves you quite a lot of money if you enjoy a couple of beers or wines  The Staff were so attentive and knew your name from the first time you entered the Exec Lounge  Nothing was too much trouble for them  The Pachanga Resaurant was also good value for money  We were there to celebrate our Ruby Anniversary and they made quite a fuss of us  The Location is also extremely good  Can t wait to go back 
P =>  Excellent hotel in a brilliant location We returned to the Hilton Jumeriah having visited last ch       We couldn t fault the service this time and the latest development in the surrounding area  The Walk  made the location even better than last time  as there were lots of restaurants to choose from right on the doorstep  This made the trip more affordable   the hotel is quite pricey for food and drinks  but the local restaurants are UK prices  We were also able to get breakfast from local cafes or one of the many Starbucks nearby  Would definitely recomment this hotel to others They are knocking down the hotel next door  but it really didn t affect the holiday as you can t really hear the demolition and if you choose to sit in the gardens or on the beach  you wouldn t even know it was happening  
P =>   Fantastic Have just spent six great nights at the Hilton Jumeirah and would definitely return  The hotel is in a great location with easy access to a variety of restaurants  the rooms were spotlessly clean and the service impeccable  The breakfast buffet had everything you could wish for and there were plenty of staff on hand to bring hot drinks literally within twenty seconds of asking  The demolition of a nearby hotel meant that I chose not to use the poolside area but thankfully the beach area wasn t too badly affected by the noise  The hotel runs a free shuttle service to the other end of town which was useful  although taxis are very cheap  Apart from the demolition work  which I assume is outside of the hotel s control and a warning has been placed on their website  I found the hotel to be quite noisy at night with the bed vibrating when the doors of the neighbouring rooms were shut The staff seem to take a personal pride in ensuring that you are being well looked after  I was put off by the extortionate prices of the drinks  even at the beach bar  but instead chose to dine at the local restaurants which offer comparable prices to London  It s definitely worth buying some wine at the duty free to drink on your balcony  
P =>   Couldn t ask for better     Just returned from a five night stay at the HDJ and there s just not a bad word to be said about the place  We booked an Executive room  walked into the hotel at       hrs and were checked in and in bed within fifteen minutes The Executive Lounge is fantastic for breakfast and in particular for the  quot Happy Hour quot  between        amp        hrs  Service from each and every member of staff in the hotel is above and beyond  We were asked one more than one occasion  quot Is there anything we can do to make your stay better quot      The simple answer to that was no  everything was spot on from the laundry to the beach bar and the executive lounge staff too The hotel is in a fantastic position too  just stroll out the front and you re on  quot The Walk quot  which always has an atmosphere and will only get better as more shops  amp  restaurants open Will definitely use the HDJ again  
P =>   Fab Hotel Best Staff We booked the Executive Room package which we found to be excellent value as soon as we arrived early morning after an overnight flight  Our room wasn t ready   it was      a m    so our bags were secured and we were guided to the Executive Lounge for breakfast straightaway  The staff are so friendly and hospitable at this hotel  it really is a case of they cannot do enough for you  and this was our experience for the   days we were there  The grounds and facilities are excellent   lots of options for lounging around in the sun  either in the pretty and well maintained grounds  by the pool or the beach  The Executive Room package provides afternoon tea and happy  hour  drinks and canapes  The staff make an effort to remember your name and provide friendly  efficient and generous service at all times Our room was very comfortable  bright and clean and there is a well stocked mini bar  although complimentary bottled water is provided every day  We would certainly stay here again   the staff take a pride in looking after you  
P =>   Fab stay at the Hilton Hotel Jumeirah Dubai Just returned from a week at the Hilton Hotel Jumeirah Beach  having lived in Dubai for a period and also holidayed there on serveral occasion the Hilton Hotel Jumeirah was excellent  The room was good  the breakfast buffet gave plenty of variety and everything was freshly made  Some noise by the poolside from the Oasis Beach Hotel next door which is being demolished  This was the only negative point in stay  But this was minimal  and never disrupted or spoiled our fab stay  The highlight of the holiday at the Hilton was the Staff  they were absolutely superb  giving      at all times  Well done Hilton Jumeirah     
P =>   A good choice We choose the Hilton Jumeirah for a   night break having read the previous reviews on Tripadvisor and were pleased that the hotel fully met our expectations  We chose an Executive Towers room and the service was excellent  Whilst the hotel reataurants are very expensive  sadly typical of modern Dubai  the hotel location gave plenty of opportunities for other eating options   The Walk  development around the hotel is almost complete and there are Mexican  Italian  Indian and Arabic restaurants offering good quality and reasonable prices  There are many more restaurants due to open over the coming months The hotel ground are well laid out with a large pool area and plenty of sunbeds in the garden areas  Although lacking the glamour of some of the newer hotels in Dubai  we would throroughly recommend the Hilton Jumeirah for a relaxing break  
P =>  Excellent room and service We stayed here one night before boarding a cruiseship and wehad the most pleasant stay  Staff is very helpfull  we arrived at am and our Suite was ready   We booked executive floor andthe airport transfer was free  Dinner at the Argentine Restaurantwas excellent  We ll come back  
P =>  Really Nice Hotel I have been to Dubai quite a few times now and stayed all over but this was the best value for money hotel I have stayed in  Weather was         degrees which made it even better  The hotel was friendly very welcoming would do anything for you even give you a welcome drink on arrival  Let me check in at  am after a long flightt which was excellent  The hotel has its own perfect beach  It really gives you everything you need  Clean  tidy huge room  All the little luxuries that make it a five star  The location is also perfect for shopping and restaurants  literally just outside the door  they also have shuttle to major malls  Only   downsides   is the building work as people have said but in Dubai your lucky to get away with that anywhere  The   is that drinks  food in the hotel are not just expensive but bordering on obscene especially alcohol  I worked it out and its nearly    a pint of beer lager even a pint of coke cost     I had a chicken burger and chips and a pint at the beach bar and it cost me      Still outside the hotel you have loads of restaurants  Burger King KFC etc  I had breakfast included and that was excellent huge choice to choose from well worth including in the rate  In short I will be going back  
P =>   Just Superb            Booked this trip away for myself and my girlfriend as a Christmas present  and in one word BRILLIENT  The staff were superb and so so attentive to you and your every request  Landed early morning and when got to the hotel at about  am the check in staff were more than happy to check me in straight away  normal time is  pm  so we could freshen up and get in straight away  The only downside for this was that it was a  tower  view that was at the back o the hotel and looked up and down  the walk  area behind where restaurants  cafes and shops were that was bustling day and night  I am not going to lie to you there was demolition of the hotel next but one  but it was fairly quiet and not happening all day  I booked knowing this and was not off put with it in the slightest  with the speed that it is coming down by end   it will be gone I booked the executive package that is a MUST you get a room on the  th or  th floor and access to the executive lounge that is open all day and serves breakfast  afternoon tea and  evening drinks and canap s all included in the price  the staff in the lounge were lovely always willing to help with anything and just there to keep you happy The one thing you have to do is the desert safari that I booked at guest relations  at a cost of    dhs each  For your money you get  hrs  dune bashing  when you driver and guide points the  x  at impossible sand dunes and then goes for it     At the end of the drive you get to watch an amazing sunset over the desert before taken to a camp where camel riding  belly dancer and a bbq buffet is served up for you  All this was superb and we did it on our last night and was an amazing end to a superb holiday In conclusion the hotel is perfect for any type business  beach  that it has it own private with butler service  or just a getaway as it is in the heart of a growing area Please note that on our first day we tried to walk for a bit but sadly with the building work in the marina area it is virtually impossible  Take taxis they are dirt cheap and everywhere Thank you to all the staff of the Hilton this was my first stay in Dubai and first at a Hilton and I will defiantly say it will not be my last at ether would go back in a second  in fact as I write this I am looking at a cold Yorkshire morning wishing I was back in the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah 
P =>   My fav hotel in Dubai The Hilton Jumeirah is located in the Jumeirah Beach Resort  JBR  on the Walk  The Walk is a lovely cobble stoned street with plenty of restaurants  affordable  with good service AND food  and shops  It is roughly    minutes from the airport    DH from the airport    DH to the airport in taxi  The hotel has a very good service  from the reception to the room service and offers all commodities  pool  beach  gym  several restaurants  etc  The rooms are clean  all with a  rather  small balcony  Rooms with a view on the beach enjoy a huge panoramic window to make you feel like you re relaxing on the sand already  
P =>   Never again Me  my   year old daughter and my parents stayed there in january       We arrived at the hotel after a    hours journey and great was our surprise when the girl at the reception told us we have to pay a     USD deposit for each room  otherwise we cannot be checked in  that even if we had payed for the trip since october      and the TUI catalogue and our travel agent never mentioned something about deposits  Above that I got no discount at all for the child This was very unpleasant because you plan your holiday budget and all of a sudden you are     USD short Also  my parents traveled to Dubai   times and stayed only in   or   star hotels but never encountered this problem and that rude front office personnel  which almost threatened us as we refused to comply  Their solution was in the end to remove the drinks from the minibar I had a deluxe double tower view room and my parents had a sea view room  Instead they got a room with the main view of a building being demolished and a little sea  with all the noise and dust that comes with it  but with a difference in price of almost     Eur per stay My room had a communicating door with the room next to us  which was very noisy as you can hear everything from the other room  TV  toilet being flushed  talking and also nocturnal activities  Noise came from the above room also and from outside  as the tower view rooms are next to a very busy promenade where all night until     o clock ferarries  porsches and motorcycles pass  Also do not try to go out on the balcony as you will smell like burned fuel allot of pollution The room was nothing special and the bathroom a little small  clean  The breakfast buffet was also Ok  with all the usual food for breakfast in every hotel It was my first time in Dubai but will never return  skyscrapers  lots of concrete and glass  lots of traffic are not really my thing My opinion is that Dubai is too expensive for what it offers  
P =>   Lovely Hotel We had a short four night break at this Hilton  having stayed there before we knew what to expect  The staff are extremely attentive  polite and helpful  The hotel is now not surrounded by building works as most of the adjoining buildings are now complete  apart from the demolition of the hotel next door  The room was very good and the bed comfortable  We had access to the executive level which was very good and again the staff could not do enough for you The pool area is very nice and the beach good and you can see the new hotel  quot Atlantis quot  from the beach Outside the hotel  quot The Walk quot  is a good promenade of shops  cafes and restaurants saving the journey into the other parts of the city  We dined at Cocos   very reasonable  Duo was very good where you can dine from a good italian menu  The steak was very good  We also had an exceptional chinese meal at The Peacock inside the Sheraton Hotel prices are similar to that in the UK but things in general have got more expensive We took a trip to the new Dubai Mall   which still not fully open  lots of the shops say coming soon  was very surreal  It was empty  it has a huge waterfall  huge aquarium and an ice rink inside  The gold souk is also a good place to be amazed by the jewels on offer  All in all we had a very pleasant stay the weather was good and the hospitality good  We are planning our next visit next year  
P =>   Perfect for our stay We loved this hotel We stayed on the Executive Level so a fabulous buffett breakfast and evening drinks and apps were included The workout facility is fantastic Pool area is nice as is the beach  Spa treatment was reasonably priced and awesome Jumeriah Beach Residences are directly across the street  the bottom   levels feature shops  restaurants etc You will need a cab to get around  but they are very cheap and easy to come by  Room service was very good also  and all the staff were extrememly courteous  Would return here in a second  
P =>   Christmas at the Hilton Jumeirah As a frequent traveller to different Hiltons worldwide we chose yet again to return to the Hilton Jumeirah Beach for our first Christmas in Dubai                        Whilst the decision was made with some trepidation  Would it be festive for our    year old daughter and concerns re the construction  it turned out to be a decision without regrets  Having seen many stages of the areas development from the hotel s opening   years ago to the intensive development of the last   years    quot The Walk quot  is now nearing completion with the many shops and restaurants giving a feeling of a new location which will appeal to many  It is convenient to have a pharmacy  small supermarket  Costa Coffee and Subway close by especially as Dubai is now an expensive location  We would highly recommend this hotel for a Christmas vacation given the efforts of the hotel and staff to provide a festive atmosphere and fun for all the family   Best of all the hotel provides high quality whilst retaining a relaxed atmosphere together with some original staff  the greatest asset of all to this hotel   Whilst there is the demolition of the Oasis Beach taking place creating some noise pollution which may irritate some visitors this had little impact on our enjoyment  The refurbished Executive Lounge is far superior and at no time did we find it as overcrowded as in the past  definately a luxury worth adding to your stay  A special thank you to Imran and Fe who were always smiling and helpful   No doubt we will return again   quot Can t Wait   quot  
P =>   Another Wonderful Christmas I last wrote a review on this hotel two years ago and this was my  h visit to the Hilton over the Christmas period  Six of us stayed from   th ember for    nights  There was me  husband  son and mate  daughter and boyfriend   a spread across the age range  The Hilton has on every occasion been exemplary  not to be faulted and it was no different this time   Yes  as I wrote before it is dated in architecture and room decoration  but what it lacks there  it makes up for in service  The hotel is small compared to the other  quot bling quot  hotels in Dubai but is more personal  The executive room give access to the executive lounge   a good place to relax with pre  dinner drinks and canapes  quot on the house quot  as well as breakfast and nibbles throughout the day  The prices in Dubai have shot up and to have alcohol provided is a bonus  especially with four youngsters  The attitude of the staff is wonderful  They remember your names and even remember you from previous visits  The beach and bar is perfect and unlike the larger hotels the distance from room to beach is not far The surrounding area of the Hilton is now developed  Five years ago it was cranes and dust  It is now FINISHED and the  quot Walk quot  as it is now known  right outside the hotel is buzzing with locals  expats etc  There is a large  quot cafe culture quot  and the restaurants and cafes are thriving with some excellent places to eat  Of course no alcohol is served outside the hotels  In the evening the lighting and vegetation  balmy air and high grade shops make for a lovely setting  A lot of the other huge hotels are isolated in as much as they are on main roads with nowhere to walk Just beware  Nowhere in Dubai is cheap  
P =>  Very good service  I stayed on the Hilton Jumeirah Beach between the   th and   th of december      Before giving any futher details  it is a very very very good hotel  Yes  it seems outdated  It seems like an old dwarf among everything else in Dubai  but they make up for it I booked two executive rooms  The complimentary airport transfer was very efficient and the driver very pleasant  I had spent the day before in Paris and did not sleep in the airplane  When I arrived the hotel  at  am  I was expecting to do the check in and have to wait until  pm  First surprise  Unexpectdly I was told that the rooms were not ready but they could provide me a  quot temporary quot  room to take a shower and sleep  This was very nice  Second surprise  I was also told to go have breakfast with no extra charge The third surprise is that one of my rooms would be upgraded for a huge corner suite  Ok  there was no balcony  but the room was bigger than my flat in Brussels The following days were very nice with absolutely no flaws  Even when there was a minor problem  everyone would be so nice and sympathic that you would not feel it  The beach of the Hilton is very nice  I was told that is one of the few places in Dubai where you can still get real waves on the sea  I find waves funny     The service on the beach was also perfect As I had an executive room  I had access to the lounge for Tea and snacks in the evening  The arabian sweets were very good  The snacks in the evening could replace dinner easily The only thing that was not that good  was BiCE restaurante  A little bit overpriced and not specially good  Anyway  again  service was perfect In summary    the hotel was great  It is ugly  but flawless  I had never stayed on a Hilton before  but after this experience I will try always to find one nearby  And if I ever go to Dubai again  I will  even if I try another hotel  spend some days at the Hilton  
P =>   Lovely hotel shame about Dubai  We stayed at the Hilton for   nights  we had access to the executive lounge but couldnt get a room on the executive floor so we were given a choice of free stuff or free lunches to compensate  The staff are lovely but over anxious to please   I had   different housekeeping staff come to the room in    minutes checking different things  Next door to the Hilton a hotel is being demolished so there was some construction noise   we were told this before travelling  The hotel is located in the marina which is itself under construction   I have never seen so many tower blocks in my life and doubt will do again  I suppose as they say it will be lovely when its finished    
P =>   Excellent Hotel We booked a last minute trip to this hotel based on the good reviews on Trip Advisor  They were right  We stayed for   nigthts at the beginning of ember and opted for the Excecutive option The hotel was clean and tidy  right on the beach with a lovely pool area  garden and private beach front  What makes this hotel though is the staff  they are excellent  I am pretty well travelled and have stayed in some excellent and expensive hotels but this hotel beats the lot as far as service is concerned  Unlike many other hotels though  the service is not designed to make you tip  there is a genuine desire to make your stay as pleasurable as possible The staff in the  quot executive quot  lounge in particular are outstanding  nothing was too much trouble  hi to Imran  Yvette  Neil  Brian and all the ladies   I would highly recommend the executive option  Although it will add to the cost of your stay it will probably save you money overall and make your stay more enjoyable  The breakfasts are excellent  afternoon tea is great and the evening drinks with canapes lovely  The lounge itself is a very comfortable and relaxed environment  Eating in the hotel restaurants is expensive  about     for a pizza   so the lounge can help you cut down on expensive means elsewhere  Drinks are also expensive so with the pound being so bad at the moment I think the lounge is well worth the money  If you go executive don t forget you can also ask for a pick up to and from the airport for no extra charge  a nice big beemer  The hotel is located on  quot The Walk quot  which has new restaurants and shops opening all the time  Its a nice location to go out for a stroll along the walk in an evening  The private beach is excellent  nice poolside and beachside bars and lovely landscaped gardens Overall I would highly recommend this hotel  When I am next in Dubai I am sure to stay here again  
P =>   Good hotel but very very busy I stayed here for two nights at the end of a holiday in Dubai Oman  Had stayed for the first few nights in Bur Dubai and wanted to see another part of the city  The Hilton was a really nice hotel  But absolutely manically busy  the lobby was a bit like a train station  The staff are really nice but you get the feeling that they are running on empty as they have so many people to run about after you  We were upgraded to a sea view room  which was lovely  The breakfast in the hotel was great  really good selection of everything  There is direct access from the hotel to the beach which is really busy  reminded me of Rimini in the   s    lots of beautiful  young people  and it s fairly hectic  There s a good atmosphere around here with several bars and restaurants close by  The hotel is at the very fringe of the  quot new dubai quot  area so if you want to go to other areas of the city it s a bit of a trek  I imagine this would be good if you wanted a beach holiday and weren t really interested in exploring Dubai but it might be better to stay slightly closer to Jumeirah if you wanted to go to other areas  All in all it was pretty nice and a good holiday atmosphere  The only thing I would say is that there were lots of old couples  Germans and Russians mainly  hanging about in string vests etc which wasn t so nice   it seemed to be a slightly cranky older crowd that were staying here but I think you get that in a lot of places in Dubai  
P =>   Highly recommended Just returned from the Hilton and thought that the hotel and staff were fantastic  We booked an executive room  which wasn t huge but the additional attention to detail throughout the stay was worth it  We were met at the airport by a driver offering us complimentary water and face towels  The queue for taxis was massive despite being midnight  so it was nice to be able to go straight to the car  The transfers to and from the airport are included when you book an executive room We didn t book breakfast because we noticed that the executive rooms allowed access to the executive lounge and we thought that we would be able to get pastries and coffee from there  We hadn t realised that a full breakfast was served each morning in the lounge   then afternoon tea and then evening drinks and snacks  All food and drink in the executive lounge is complimentary  including alcoholic drinks between  pm       pm   You could probably eat in the executive lounge all week and never buy any food  But the restaurants in and around the hotel are also varied and generally reasonably priced  All of the staff were incredibly helpful  efficient and friendly  From start to finish  the stay at the Hilton was great  It is  only     floors high and now surrounded by high rise buildings but this is really a criticism of Dubai   not the Hilton  I think that the hotel  private beach area and pool were lovely and if we were to return to Dubai  the Hilton would be our first choice  
P =>   Loved this Hotel Stayed here for   nights  Hotel spotlessley clean  staff fantastic and in a great location who can beat it  Plenty of places to walk to around the hotel  great pool and beach Would definately stay here and recommend to friends and family  Good location and easy access to all main attractions  BiCE sky bar a must for evening cocktails  Dubai still in deveopment so lots of building works but this didn t spoil our break   what a place            will be back  
P =>   First class Having had to move from another hotel as a result of poor conditions what a joy it was to arrive at the Hilton  The front desk manager  Damir Kartal  set the tone for our stay  We had a room on the executive floor and it was pleasure all the way  Breakfast in the executive suite  all day light refreshments  afternoon tea and scones  and free alchoholic drinks between   and   pm   Most rooms have a sea view  the pool area is well laid out there are ample beach beds and first class service is on offer everywhere  Eating is a joy  you can stay a few days and never visit the same restaurant and the food quality is very good  the view across the Jumeirah Palm is wonderful and on the landside the new shopping Mall is almost fully open  The very busy Abu Dhabi Dubai road is very near yet the hotel location is on the beach and it is impossible to hear any traffic noise  Certainly a hotel that provides stunning levels of service and must be on the  quot we will return list quot  for many  
P =>   Great View  We had a wonderful room with expansive views over both the pool and beach  The Hilton gave good service and the room was both spacious and cool  The pool area and outside eating area are great  We did think the restaurant meals were quite expensive for what you got  
P =>   Amazing Experience We had booked a Suite and a car to collect us from the Airport  We were met by a very courteous driver in an immaculate BMW   Series  Once in the Hotel we were escorted for private check in on the executive floor  as part of our room cost   However  we were told that we had been upgraded to the largest room the hotel   The Royal Suite  It was amazing with   balconies and incredible views and a jacuzzi   We also access to the complimentary food and drink on the executive floor which was off an excellent standard  Additionally we made full use of the Bice Sky bar and private hotel beach  I would certainly recommend the hotel  as we also saw other standards room that were of a high quality  Furthermore  the Hilton staff were always on hand and very polite and smiley at all times We had a wonderful experience purely because of the care and attention from the employees of the hotel  
P =>  Not that good     Booked the Hilton Jumeriah on trip advisor reviews and also due to being a Hilton Honors member  we thought we would get the best of both worlds Have stayed in Dubai before so expect high quality in both standards and service and expected the normal Hilton standards too  It was OK   Traveled with   children aged   and    months Flew with Royal Brunei who were absolutey fine  All on time and well looked after which is all that is required The inside of the hotel was clean and tidy  the outside around the pool area was very dissappointing  Very dirty  very dusty and not kept to the normal impeccable high standards of Dubai hotels The hotel is very expensive  especially for drinks    About     for one beer and one glass wine      As is all of DubaiThe food in the hotel is very good excellent selection for breakfast  Peranga s restaurant is excellent too  however very expensive  Made to feel very welcome especially with the children  The barbeque on the beach front serves wonderful food and has the most friendly staff We had use of the executive lounge which offers afternoon tea and free canapes and bar  between   and     pm  which was great  This is particularly useful if you have children  as   of the bars in the hotel will not allow children in  This had not been the case in other Dubai hotels we have stayed in You cannot purchase alcohol in any of the restaurants outside of the hotel on the Walkway   except Wagamamas   neither do they sell alcohol in the supermarket  You might want to take some with you from duty free     The kids club was excellent  very friendly staff and my little girl loved going there for a few hours each day  An array of all sorts of toys and games  all of high quality and extremely clean and tidy  You do have to stay with children under   s The pool itself was great for the kids  with a small kidies pool as well  By about    ish the pool was completely shaded so no worries of kiddies beng out in the sun all day The beach are was clean and well looked after and the sea beautiful I will point out though that they have started to knock down the hotel   Oasis Beach   directly next door to the Hilton Jumeriah  Talking to the Manager the area is to be replaced with a Hilton Beach club  apartments etc  This is obviuosly gong to involve a tremendous amount of building work and distruption and is literally behind the wall next to the pool area  You may want to check how much distruption this is going to cause Although we had a great time and LOVE Dubai itself  I would think twice about going back to this hotel  There are so many other fantastic hotels in Dubai that are definitely rated higher than this one  
P => not up to Hilton Standards We stayed for   nights a this hotel  stopover from Bhutan  and we would never go there again  The staff were very friendly  No remarks there but the room  First of all the drapings around the boxspring of the bed were dirty and torn  Second there were the curtains  in urgent need of replacing  stained and torn in some spots  Also the lamphoods of the readinglights near the bed needed some cleaning  This is definitely not worthy of a five star residence  Then there was also the beach area  The cusions of the lounge chairs could do with replacement or upholstery  It is not the first time we stayed at a Hilton Hotel Resort but this one was definitely not up to Hilton standards or  star standards  
P =>   Great beach location   shame about the building works For the past   years my husband and I have always chosen this hotel to stay in when visiting Dubai and probably always will  Its great to visit if you are a couple or a family  they never put one before the other We have stayed both using the executive services and just B amp B and have never felt let down by either  If you have kids and can afford to pay a little extra then I would recommend the executive rooms as they can snack and drink all day long The location is super as they have their own section of beach that isn t allowed to be used by anyone other than hotel guests and visitors  so no construction workers invaiding your privacy  you can look out from the beach across to the Palm and its just far enough out that you don t get bothered by tourists The only let down is the huge amount of building works being carried out around the whole of the area  but that isn t the hotels fault  You ll get construcation everywhere you go around Dubai currently This place is laid back enought to let you be what you want on holiday but at the same time they are there to cater to your every need  
P =>   Still a great stay Stayed here   years ago and had a wonderful time hence the return  Rooms and general decor as good as before  it never seems to show any sign of wear and tear Booked executive floor as before as well but stayed longer this time and made the most of it  It really is worth the extra money especially for the drinks in the evening   pm to     pm    free beer  wine  some spirits and a number of hot and cold canapes   considering that a pint of beer in the bar is nearly     this is a welcome  freebie   The staff in the lounge were fantastic The whole area around Jumeirah has changed radically  and for the better  There are a number of good food places  Wagamama which is the only restaurant outside of the hotel that serves alcohol  Pizza Express opening soon  a number of sushi bars  Starbucks  not to mention a couple of supermarkets   It will be interesting to see how the hotel positions itself against these new places   you are no longer beholden to hotel prices for water etc  You are unable to eat and drink your own stuff by the pool but at the moment this is not a rule for the beach  A number of times we nipped to Subway for a    sandwich when beach prices would have put it nearer to     Ate in Pachanga and had a good meal but didnt rate BiCE as highly as previous visits  I think because prices in Dubai seem to have really risen but the level of food has remained high but not high enough for the cost  Also ate at Verre  Gordon Ramsay  at the Hilton Dubai Creek  fantastic  just dont have the duck  tough  apparently due to Halal preparation  Gym was great  especially the Powerplate   massage was pretty good as well Only downside to the hotel would be the concierge   none of them really seemed that interested in being helpful or doing it with a smile which is in stark contrast to the rest of the hotel staff All in all a very enjoyable    days lying on the beach and thoroughly enjoying the executive lounge  
P =>  fantastic hotel we stayed in this hotel in august we stayed on the executive floor so had the cocktail hour  high tea and breakfast the hotel is beautiful the rooms are spacious the staff very attentive  the restaurents first claas the salsa restaurent beautiful food and great atmosphere we went   times in a   day stay my only gripe would be the childrens club we have stayed all over dubai we live in riyad the week before we had stayed at the oasis beach hotel before it closed and the childrens club was first class  in the hilton the staff in the kids club are not interested my children wanted to leave after    mins  so that could be better also the children were not very welcome in the executive lounge which is different then other hotels on jumeriah beach we did love it and would go again  
P =>   Fantastic Place GREAT hotel very very clean  organised and relaxing  Book the executive room  you get unlimited buffet breakfast  afternoon tea and cake and also unlimited alcohol drinks from  pm till  pm along with nibbles  It is worth every penny and great value for money  There is a special floor just for executive club members and it is a little peace of heaven Restaurants at hotel are excellent  recommend you try BICE Italian restaurant very good value for money and home cooked food by top chefs The rooms are a good size very clean  we stayed on the  th floor and had a good view  Your bedding is changed daily and there is a turn down service on the evening including chocs You also get   free bottles of water in your room daily  which is a welcome gift after a day at the beach or pool The beach is private and a security guard stops any non hotel guests getting in  Beach is clean  man made  and water sports available as well as camel rides Disappointed in pool area  its quite small and never any beds available although there was a certain type of person around the pool so it was actually quite nice to be able to get away from that atmosphere and use the beach Shopping is good  although please do not go out without respecting the local customs  Dubai is quite relaxed for a Muslim country however it is respectful to cover your shoulders and legs down to the knee when leaving the hotel  You see very ignorant people showing no respect and thinking they were on a holiday to Ibiza Don t be one of those  brits  that get tutted at and badged as typical  
P =>   Another Great location to stay What can I say about this hotel except what a great time I had here  I looked at lot of the reviews before I went and did worry adout what some said aboud the surroungings to hotel but to be honest I shouldn t have been  Most of the surrounding construction has by on large been finished  This was now a great walking area  And from either room pool or very very nice private beach no work can be heard  The staff as as frendly as you expect to find in and good hotel  I had no problem with the room  It was very clean  well maintained and everthing I needed from a hotel room was there  Yes you can se some work going on on one of the Palms but only in the distance and far away  And it is good to see the lights at night  The hotel has two very very good restaurants  The Bice and the Latin inspired Pachanga restaurant  However being some one who likes a good steak I strongly reccommend the latter  WOW what a good meal  It searved one of the best steaks I have had and the whole meal was a joy 
P =>  Flexible and Friendly Was in Dubai for just a day for a meeting  and got in on a red eye flight arriving at  am  The front desk was very helpful and check in was quick and efficient  and I was given a room immediately on reaching the hotel at about  am No fuss  no trying to find out which tier membership i have  nothing   On reaching my room  I discovered that I had left my mobile phone in the cab  again    When I got in touch with the bell desk  they were very helpful  called my India phone repeatedly  till the cabbie answered and dropped it back a short while later Breakfast was decent  They swapped my breakfast to the day i checked in as I was leaving early next morning Rooms are generally good  funclional  and very clean  Slightly small though  The balcony is another plus which could certainly be a very very big plus during times when it is not a sweltering   C outside BiCe the italian restaurant  is very good  Great ambience  great food  and impecable service The only hitch i found  maybe it was specific to my room  was that the shower water was either very hot or very cold  and the mixer could somehow never settle at an in between  comfortable temperature  The service guy who tried to fix it seemed to suggest that this is a problem he knew happened often Other than this  everything was fantastic  Taxi s are easily available  The beach is at your doorstep  Mall of the Emirates is    min by cab  Downtown about    mins Will certainly stay there again  as well as recommend to others Please make sure you book on the net directly with the hotel  as the rates are much better than what agents offer  as I discovered   
P =>   Hilton Dubai Jumeirah i booked via hilton co uk and stayed i king suite its located at the bottom of jumeirah beach near dubai marina hotel has excellent facilities for kids our   year old loved the baby pool and kids club hotel is very clean rooms are excellent service was fantastic walk out of the hotel straight to the beach close to emirates shopping mall to try the ski dubai overall excellent stay cant fault the hotel would definetly stay there again 
P =>   Perfect Stay Not up to the looks of the Burj or the Kempinski  but a what a perfect little gem the HJ is Located on its own stretch of private beach everything from checkin to checkout was perfect The pool is not that huge  and people get their towels down early   However  they are missing the point The beach is   minutes down the hill  and there are ample sunbeds and the most beautiful waters  the beach is spotless  no litter   whatsoever   minor point   but worth mentioning  There is also a games room on the  th floor with PS  S and table tennis and a selection of gamesThe gym is huge and there is a steam room and sauna on siteWe went in ust and in the hot months the sand is very hot  as is the water  so be warned those who cant stand the heat  literally Practicalities There are numerous restaurants in the locality   Chilis  Starbucks  Le Pain Quotidien  to name a few   KFC opening soon   look a little harder and there is a supermarket across the road  So get fruits water here to ease your bill The complimentary shuttle runs twice in the morning to Mall of Emirates   into Diera and onto Dubai Creek Hilton  In the afternoon every hour to MotE A taxi to the airport will cost AED        and there is a rank outside the hotel  to MotE about AED     
P =>   Superb Location This is a fabulous hotel  We booked this for our first trip to Dubai as a family and were advised to stay here by friends and family Great service from arrival through to departure  Great place on the beach and kids loved the kids club which is provided free Breakfast is a brilliant selection of everything you could want and overall staff were excellent I stayed with wife and two young kids and was given a double room with two queen sized beds with balcony  Rooms kept clean and tidy and balcony allows you to quickly dry the clothes from the beach and pool  
P =>   Nice hotel surrounded by a building site We stayed at the Hilton for three days at the end of our tour to China  The Hilton was quite a way out of the city  near to the new marina being built  All around the hotel was only what I can describe as a building site  There was dust and building works everywhere  However once inside the hotel you would not have know this at all  The hotel was clean  there was no noise from outside what so ever  The hotel was very pleasant  the staff were very friendly  the restaurant had a good choice of food and the swimming pool was adequate  The prices in the mini bar in the room were very pricey as were the drinks in the bar  The hotel is situated right on the beach which is beautifl  There were camels on the beach and plenty of sunbeds  There is a bar at the beach  The water sports were extremely expensive  A boat ride for half an hour cost     each  Dubai itself is fantastic with so much to do and see   Wild Wadi water park is a must  The entrance fee is a little high but is well worth a day there  My son loved it  Shopping in the City and at the Mall of the Emirates is never ending  If you get to go to Dubai early in the year when the shopping festival is on  a visit to the global village is the most amazing experience  There is a fair  street entertainers  loads of shopping and many many restaurants  We took a trip  which i booked in the UK on a   x   desert adventure  We were picked up at     pm and returned about      in the evening  We spent a couple of hours on the sand dunes in the   x   s then went to a camel farm and onto a village in the dessert where we could do sand boarding  camel rides  watch the birds of prey   or belly dancer  We had a b b q and then returned to the hotel  A great day out  I would stay at the hotel again but i would prefer to stay somewhere a little nearer to the city  Having said that whilst the building work is going on there are some fantastic deals to be had at the hilton and other hotels in that area  Could not fault the hotel  
P =>   Still very good This is the second time we have stayed at the Hilton in    months and would still highly recommend it  The hotel has undoubtedly got the best spot on the beach as     yards either way it is a bit messier and the water is cloudier and is now smack in the middle of all the restaurants on The walk  There have been substantial changes in Dubai in the last    months  some for the good and some for the bad The bad Cost  Cost  Cost  CostI would say the Dubai is at least     more expensive than it was last year which was a shame but inevitable i suppose therefore budgeting is essential The goodThe walk is almost completed at the jumeirah beach residence and this is a huge plus staying at the Hilton  You now have an array of good quality restaurants and shops just across the road which makes life so much easier  You have the following restaurants at the walk available DUO  Italian  opening this week Chillis   American grill  good basic food Mexican  very good Ruby Tuesdays   American grill  Excellent Sukh Sagar   vegetarian  Excellent Chowking   Chinese  Very poor Wagamamas   Asian  Very good Deli next to Starbucks    Very good Noodle Room   Chinese    Very good The Fish and Chip shop   The air con was broken when we went and the place was full of flies which no one working their seemed to mind which put us off Plus a few more that are opening soon  All will cost around          for two adults and a child with non alcoholic drinks  A word of warning though  none of the above have any concept of portion control therefore order half of what you would like as we binned far too much food as there was always far too much to eat  Wagamamas are the only ones that serve alcohol There are two supermarkets  one in the Oasis beach tower building and one up stairs at the JBR  Both are really cheap and were used daily for soft drinks and snacks as paying up to       for a can of coke in the hotel was painful  The supermarkets were also handy for lotions and toys for the kids to play with in the pool We revisited a couple of all haunts such as Souk Madinat which still has undoubtedly the best restaurants available in the area  We revisited  quot USHNA quot  which was still very good but did not justify     for the three of us bearing in mind we had a vegetarian Indian meal at Sukh Sagar equally as good if not better for a third of the price The Meat Co    Excellent    Still pricey at around     for the   of us but well worth it as the steaks were fantastic The Mall of the Emirates   I still highly rate the food court their as you can eat for     for three and still have a reasonable meal  A special mention goes to Beirut for their mixed kebabs  Fantastic All in all shopping is still cheaper in Dubai than in the UK so don t kill your self here to buy everything at home as you can save a few   out there My Top tips for the Hilton and Dubai are as follows When you arrive at DXB buy all of you booze their  It is cheaper than in the uk and a lot less hassle  Buy a couple of slabs of cans of beer as    a pint is expensive  The hotel did not seems to mind this at all as long as you confine it to your room When checking in at the Hilton ask for a room with an odd number or pool view as all even numbers with a sea view look out over a small building site and a very large car park for JBR  Save the cost of a sea view as it is far to hot to sit out anyway Stock up on cold drinks and snacks from the supermarket and use the fridge to cool them  We used the mini bar and replaced them from their each night Go during Ramadan as it is much quieter and cheaper  
P =>  Hilton   WOW     Wow is all I can say  this is not the most modern looking hotel in the area but location wise it is perfection  The actuall hotel inside is beutiful  cool and spotless  the rooms are all beautiful and maintained daily with fresh towels and bedding  the staff are second to none and honestly would do anything for you  everything is  quot yes mam quot    quot thank you mam quot  The pool is of good size but do try and get up early to catch a sunbed as they go quickly  The beach area is beautifully maintained but the sand is boiling hot to run accross I would stay at this hotel again without a doubt and was completely delighted with our stay there and this is great value for money  there is building works all over Dubai and near the hotel  On the street outside the hotel  which i add gets jetwashed every night and all the lamp posts cleaned    There are several new restaurants just open and are all spotless and so nice Make sure you visit the Rib room in emirates towers and also the chinese restaurant in the Sheraton hotel next door called  quot Peackock quot  the best meal iv had in    years  Also visit Waxys and rock bottom cafe for Friday brinch     dirhams gets you lunch  amp  diner along with   pints     
P =>  Wonderful Introduction to Dubai  Stayed at the Hilton in Dubai last ober for   nights  My boyfriend booked the holiday only a couple of weeks before we went and this was really the only hotel available at the time  Well werent we lucky  couldnt have asked for more  Stayed on executive floor which was great  worth it for the extra touches The beach for me was the best part of the hotel  was amazing  as soon as you stepped onto the sand  you where shown a bed and your towel laid out for you  Golf buggies take drinks around and melon etc is given out throughout the day  Also loved the little chairs to sit on in the sea  very refreshing Overall the Hilton provided a wonderful introduction to Dubai and all the amazing places that come with it  I am now in love with the place   Would definately recommend staying in this lovely hotel  
P =>  SUPERB IN EVERY WAY We spent a week at this hotel  at the beginning of y  From check in to departure we enjoyed every minute of our stay  All the staff were so frendly and willing to be of assistance when ever needed  nothing seemed to be too much trouble  It was extremely hot    degrees most days but it was suprising how quickly you got use to it  The hotel has a superb location directly on the beach  which we really enjoyed  they even supply you with beach towels   The watersports on offer on the beach were a big hit with our    year old son  Those extra special touches like ice cold flannels on arrival on the beach and the lovely fresh pineapple drink on arrival were a really lovely touch The room was spacious  even with   beds in it  and well stocked with toilettries in the bathroom  The room was kept clean  to an incredibly high standard  every day We booked half board in the Oceana restaurant and the choice of food each night was amazing  with a different theme every night  there was so much choice and we ate foods from around the world Most of the building work around the hotel has been finished  although alot of the shops in the complex opposite the hotel  are still unoccupied Taxi s were extremely cheap to use and the hotel shuttle bus very handy for trips out A trip to the Gold Souk is intersting  as is a trip on an Abra across the Creek  You feel completely safe wherever you go and the locals are so friendly Dubai is certainly an interesting holiday destination and we hope to go back sometime  
P =>  agree completely with beeloxII agree with all that beelox II says but have t o say that you should ask for the sea view  we got the tower view and didn t see much of the sea for the whole time we were there  very  conicrete   Also agree with an earlier coment re sun beds    the pool area is small for the size of hotel and altho they say they monitor the sun beds they don t and there really aren t enough to go around if you don t get down there and reserve your spot with a towel   we had executive floor access and the staff couldn t have been more helpful   they made it their buiness to know my name and room nuber wherever we were in the hotel  I spent three dyas here catching up with a friend for an  older  girls pamper relax and it was absolutely perfect for the purpose  
P =>  Excellent hotel   Friendly efficient and perfect all round My wife and I have just spent a brilliant week in this excellent hotel  There is nothing I can say bad about the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah as everything was perfect  We arrived late on a Wednesday night  just after      pm   We had transfers arranged with the hotel and they were waiting with a card in arrivals with our name on it   we were led straight to the waiting car   A white Audi A   our driver introduced himself and loaded our luggage before we took off into the night   we were given two bottles of ice cold water   gladly received after even a few minutes in the heat of the car park  the temperature in Dubai at      pm was still    Degrees C  Approximately    minutes later we were arriving at the hotel  we met like celebrities and were not allowed to carry any of our own bags  everything was taken through to us  We were greeted by a man with ice cold towels and fresh fruit juice for us  a nice touch  As we had booked executive rooms we had the choice of going straight to the  th floor and the executive lounge check in but as there was no queue in the main reception we chose to continue our check in here  The receptionist was brilliant  full of information about the hotel  locations  etc  We were asked if we would like to leave a deposit on our credit card to enable us to book things to the room throughout our stay   which we did  they just take a pre authorisation swipe which reserves a small amount on your card in our case it was about            dhms  following this we were shown to our room on the  th floor        a Hilton King Executive Plus room  the room was a delight just two doors away from the executive lounge  more about that later    icy cold silent air conditioning greeted us  a massive king size bed    ft x  ft a nice comfy arm chair and stool  massive bathroom with a bath shower and bidet and a huge selection of Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries   everything is included  shaving kit  tooth brush and toothpaste  shampoo conditioner  body lotion  nail kits  shower cap  shower gell  moisturising soaps  You don t need to bring anything in this line as everything is provided  There is a mini bar in the room that contains a whole range of spirits  cans of lager  soft drinks etc  the prices are steep compared to the shops but I didn t think they were too bad  soft drinks were were    dhms  a beer was    dhms as was the spirits  The mini bar also included chocolate and crisps as well as golf balls sun tan lotion and mossie repellent  though there is no need for this as we never saw or heard any Our room had a fantastic view looking out over the pool and the Arabian sea with views of the Jumeirah Palm islands and the new Atlantis Palm Hotel in the distance  The balcony is a nice place to sit at night and take a nice drink though beware its extremely hot during the end of y beginning of ust  The hotel has a number of bars and restaurants  we never tried them all but the ones we did we had no real complaints about   the Axis bar which is in the lobby is open    hours a day and you can get limited food here  the same items that are on the room service night menu I believe  a pint of fosters was    dhms and a   pint was    dirhams so about       and       respectively  Cocktails were    dhms or around      these prices applied to all the bars we used  including the swim up bar  The best bar for relaxing with a great view over the area was the BICE skybar   on the   th floor   open till       in the morning  As I said we had an executive room that gave us access to the executive lounge  this is quite a large and newly refurbished area  that has a small library and daily newspapers as well as a ouple of internet terminals  charges still apply here   The executive lounge opens for breakfast and is a mix of self service and waiter service   when you enter you find yourself a table and then the waitress will take your drinks order  fresh coffee  tea  any fruit juices  and she will take your toast order  At this stage you can order any eggs you want too as the only self service egs on the hot plates were scrambled  The room is laid out in sections  you have one section that contained a whole range of breads  pastries  cakes jams honey etc etc  then another that contained all the fruits and salads and cheeses along with cereals  then you had the general hot items  grilled veal bacon  veal sausage  hash browns  tomatoes mushrooms etc  then on the end was the  pork station  this is where the pork bacon and pork sausages along with hams and salamis were  You helped yourself to all these items   as much as you liked   and constantly through the breakfast staff will be asking to top up your coffee tea and juices etc The lounge is open all day for you to help yourself to soft drinks just take from the fridge and if there staff are aware of your presence they will fetch you a glass with ice lemon etc  there is alos a coffee machine for freshly made espresso cappuccino chocolate etc  At  pm they bring out a high tea  lots of strawberries  cream chocolate sauce along with freshly baked scones  and other cakes  There is also a selection of small sandwiches  This lasts till about        At       they provide you with small snacks of nuts  crackers cheese and normally three or   hot items like samosas or chicken nuggets etc  Your free alcohol drinks are served during this time        pm   these consist of bottled beers  red and white wine  decent stuff  and a limited amount of international brand spirits  vodka  whisky  gin  white rum  baileys   they never had any bourbon  He loung is a nice setting with a number of balconies if you can stand the heat  The executive lounge is a must  such good value when you realise what you get included  By taking an executive room we got the breakfast thrown in and the transfers to the airport and back a well as the general exec lounge access for drinks   If you are going out and about the bell boys will summons a taxi for you   they queue up outside the hotel in a special rank and were always available apart from Friday lunchtime when the muslim drivers go to prayers   we had about    minute wait for a taxi on Friday lunchtime  Taxis in dubai are very cheap from the hotel to mall of emirates was only    dhms less than      the hotel puts on a courtesy bus but its hardly worth the saving when the taxis are so cheap   no where in the Jumeirah area was more than      even when we went to the Deira area the fare was only     This is an excellent hotel and very good value  You will not be disappointed with your choice of hotel when you get here  I would go back without hesitation  
P =>   Lovely hotel My boyfriend and I have just returned from a   night stay at this hilton and would certainly recommend it  The staff are friendly and and will go out of their way to help you  The rooms and pool area is spotless  however there did tend to be a lack of sunbeds   As it was so hot  av   oC   we did not use the beach area much  but this too was a brilliant setting and maintained well  The room service we ordered on a number of occasions was at a good value and of good quality however the food and drinks around the poolside are more on the expensive side Overall we had a really lovely stay at this hotel and would definitely return at some point in the future  
P =>   Superb  My brother and I decided to spend a few days in Dubai and this hotel looked great   and it was  The staff are super  the facilities are great  the pool is large and kept at a good temperature and the private beach is an absolute treat Just something about Dubai in general  you should be aware that Dubai is not the kind of place where it is easy to get around  If you are going to go for this kind of hotel  then you are opting for a  quot beach holiday quot   Traffic is extremely heavy and making your way from the beach resorts to the city can take up to     hours  That being said  if it is a beach holiday you want  a hotel like this Hilton is ideal  
P =>   excellent hotel Have just returned from holiday at Hilton Jumeirah and just had to leave a review of this hotel which is excellent  We stayed here   yrs ago and had same opinion then although at that time the surrounding area was a building site with a lot of noise and we didnt know whether to choose this hotel again  Im so glad we did all the building works finished and theres no noise  also across the road theres now lots of shops  restaurants  cafes  banks an excellent supermarket and a pharmacy We ate at hotel last time but this time we went across the road to ChowKing a really good value chinese  chillis  if you like a lot of food on your plate go there   we also hired a car this time which I recommend it was quite cheap and great for exploring you do have to be aware they drive differently from home ie overtaking on any side but you soon get used to it also most places its free parking we even ventured into karama at night for some  real fakes  as they call it got some great bags  Finally I would recommend this hotel as the twice weve been its been great cant do enough for you and very polite and friendly staff 
P =>  Fantastic Stayed end  with my    year old son  Treated like royalty from the time we were met at Dubai Airport  until we were dropped off for the flight home six days later  Rooms are very comfortable and kept immaculate  Restaurants  we tried them all   were very good  including the buffet  particularly breakfast  The service at this hotel is second to none  the staff cannot do enough to make for you  Only grumble  the reserving of sunbeds around the pool area  mainly by the Brits I am sorry to say   The hotel should take action to stop this  Plenty of beds on the beach  As with other areas of the hotel  service around pool and beach areas outstanding We had afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab which is an absolute must  and stretches out over a couple of hours  Highly recommend the Hilton  we will definitely be going back  
P =>   Outstanding This hotel is brilliant  everything about it is excellent  The most notable part of my stay was the outstanding staff  there were plenty of staff who treated you like royality  Check in is fast and efficient  you even get a welcome drink upon arrival  which after a long flight is perfect at   in the morning  The rooms were nice  spacious with a balcony overlooking the amazing jumeirah beach  the pool is small for the hotel  but this is made up for by the private beach that is pciture perfect  once again  there is a beach bar where the staff are excellent  Would highly recommend and hoping to go back later in the year  
P =>   amazing hotel  except for Fridays  An amazing hotel  The rooms are amazing  the pool area is fab and the food is very good too   but quite expensive   A few minor points thoughthose in the executive floor are treated much better than those in other floors and there is no consistency as to who receives an upgrade to the  th floor the pool area is fab but there is limited sunbeds around the actual pool area  Also on fridays  the first day of the weekend in Dubai  the place was overrun by locals who were extremely unfriendly to other guests but very friendly with the management   From the pool I even saw an English couple being asked to give up their sunbeds for   local guys  I would not have minded if they were guests but they were obviously not  The management need to address this  A minor worry for an otherwise amazing hotel  
P =>  Smashing hotel top class hotewl that is run like clockwork  bedrooms are beautiful and kept perfect by the mountains of staff  food is gorgeous and the beach  pool and outdoor amenities are second to none 
P =>   excellent hotel love dubai Excellent hotel love dubai  We are booking to go back again in october   The only fault is the airconditioning everywhere is so cold  I stayed at the sheraton   years ago with my husband which he prefered as there was more going on at night but i found the hilton a good location and great restaurants only fault is if you want something to do at night the hilton is very quiet  The meridien hotel about   mins away has an excellent large outside bar that you must visit  
P =>   Excellent Short Break I spent   excellent days early this month at the Hilton J Beach and loved it  Was picked up at the airport and driven to the hotel  given a cold towel and water in the car   The airport pick up was complimentary of the hotel as I had booked an executive room  Check in was swift via the executive lounge and even though I arrived at     am I was in my room    minutes later and had been upgraded to an executive suite  The staff are just wonderful  Nothing is too much trouble  It s worth booking an executive room as the perks are great  Breakfast  snacks and soft drinks all day           pm happy hour and evening nibbles   lovely The pool area gets busy as from  am in the morning but beware many send husbands boyfriends to secure a lounger at the crack of dawn by placing towels   Hilton please sort this out  Had dinner on Sunday night at the Oceana very nice and not too pricey  Beach was good  quiet and no onlookers  Hotel provides bus services to Mall of Emirates and the Gold Souk which is quite handy  I was on my own on this trip as it was business but if I had gone with my family would have found eating lunch and dinner at the hotel too expensive for a family of four  Better off having an early swim  breakfast  lunch at the Mall and visit the executive lounge for drinks  nibbles etc that is if you are on a budget  If not have a nice time and one more thing  the suites are quite spacious  Shopping wise don t forget to haggle in the markets   cut the price in half and move up from there  Have a great holiday  
P =>   Good Stay   Hilton Stay         for   nights  Easy check in although english not great of the check in man at  am after a long flight over from Gatwick  Rooms clean and tidy  Average view  had to put neck out of window to see pool and sea view  Pool area not recommeded for young kids babies    x very small childrens pool and parents fighting to get beds near pool to be close to kids  Lots of beds for adults  beach etc etc  Staff friendly and helpful  Food good  We were only B amp B and it kept us going until later afternoon  All staff really friendly and couldnt do enough for you  We had no issues with hotel at all and would stay again but will probably save up for Jumeriah Beach  Only negative is childrens pool   and they will need one as its so hot  
P =>  The Wiltshire Review We wanted a short break somewhere hot  amp  sunny and decided on Dubai as other family members had been to Dubai and said it was a great place for a break  We flew with Qatar ailrlines which were excellent  On arrival we were met and transfered to the hotel free of charge in a BMW as we had booked an  Executive suite    this made the start to our break just great On arrival at the hotel we were given drinks and checked in promptly   another swift and organised service  The following morning we decided to try the Executive Lounge for breakfast as we had booked an  Executive suite   It was lovely and quiet and the staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs The hotel has its own private beach  amp  pool that were excellent and very staffed  I was very impressed how quickly the staff dealt with another holidaymaker who was sufferring with the intense heat  I saw a staff  amp  a hotel medic arrive very quickly to attend to the holidaymaker We ate in the hotel on the first day which was excellent with a very good selection of vegetarian food  The only thing I would say is that it was very pricey We decided to try other places like Emirates Mall  amp  Ruby Tuesday   again very good service and nice non alcoholic cocktails  Room service was excellent and they paid attention to detail  little sea shells left on the bed    nice touch Would we go again   Yes   we weren t bothered about shopping etc and just wanted to relax  so it was ideal for us I look forward to going again and staying in this great hotel  
P =>  Hot Hot Hot This is an above average hotel  especially if you upgrade to Executive level  Transfer is included and makes such a great start to the holiday  As usual to get to Dubai we had to travel overnight and arrived somewhat exhausted at      the next day  We did hope to be able to check in early  normal check in is        but this wasn t possible  Tip  Carry a change of clothing suitable for the sun lounger and also a small bottle of sun tan cream in hand luggage or get a bottle on arrival   Had we done that things would have started a lot better Got a room a       but with no balcony  very few rooms at this hotel have no balcony  this was changed straight away  but we had another hour wait for the room  When we arrived in the room though we had flowers  fruit a bottle of wine and a lovely presentation box of dates by way of an apology   a lovely large room with balcony Food and drinks seem quite expensive here so the happy two and a half hours was very welcome  in the executive lounge all included in the price  The lounge wasn t so much a lounge as a bistro or Cafe area where you could have snacks and drinks  only one settee and two comfortable chairs in the lounge  which was a bit of a pity  However its was very clean and a welcome break from the    degree temperature outside  Its worth a visit to a very new shopping mall over the road as they sell drinks a lot lot cheaper The beach is OK but the sea is lovely  Like stepping into your bath   No seaweed and very few stones underfoot  Would we come back   definately  
P => One Year On  Returned to this hotel virtually a year to the day for another weeks stay to see if they could match the excellent service we received last time we visited  We were not disappointed and if anything the level of service was bettered by the fact we were upgraded onto the executive floor  As far as the facilities and restaurants etc  they have all been mentioned below in previous posts and I have found them all to be of a high standard  There are hotels that are newer and offer more bling for your bucks but this hotel is in a great location  with a great beach and virtually all the major work around the hotel is now complete and your stay will not be affected by any noise etc   The attitude of the staff at this hotel is second to none  whether at management level or housekeeping  waiter level they are constantly smiling and cheerful and nothing is genuinely too much trouble to ensure your stay is a memorable one I initially doubted my decision to return to this hotel again as there is such a choice of hotels in Dubai but after this experience I will no doubt return again next year  
P =>  Excellent Hotel Having read the many positive reviews on here for the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah  we were not to be disappointed On arrival we were greeted with a cold drink before a very efficient check in  The room was spacious and extremely clean  absolutely no complaints on the standard of the room  perhaps only being allocated to room number         The general standard of the hotel was high with public areas being very well maintained  The only criticism I have is the needless  reservation  of sun beds at the pool area by fellow guests  All beds had towels on them from early in the morning when most appeared to be not in use  This is surely something the Hilton could address in some way  This problem did not exist on the beach area however where there were beds aplenty to choose from  The beach was idyllic and was kept superbly clean by the Hilton staff  The drinks service offered around the beach area was also excellent We ate in Bice  amp  Studio One  Bice certainly had the ambience and d cor however I felt is was perhaps a little overpriced for the end product  Studio One was also pricey however the food was plentiful and perfectly edible As for Dubai itself  it did not live up to all the hype and expectation that preceded our trip  It has a very much unfinished feel to it and I will only return in a number of years to see what it has to offer then  For example  opposite the hotel  they are building an area called  The Walk   This looks as though it will be a selection of shops and restaurants  which to me is what the vicinity of the Hilton desperately needs  All that was open was  Chilis  which opened during our stay  and very nice indeed   There was also a Chinese called  Chowking  that looked to be almost ready to open  As mentioned in a previous review  co Pierre White and Frankie Dettori s restaurant is also just across the road  The day we ventured over it had a  Closed for Lunch  sign on the door   yes that s true    A word of caution about Dubai Airport  We flew with Royal Brunei airlines and when checking in to come home we were shepherded to a different check in location than the Emirates flights  It was shambolic  like a cattle market and a complete free for all as people jostled trolleys trying to push their way to the front  If Dubai is serious with the level of growth in tourism they are predicting  this is a problem they need to get rectified and fast  In summary  if you choose the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah as your hotel you will not be disappointed  top marks from me  if not for Dubai itself as a holiday destination  
P =>   The perfect location for honeymooners in Dubai Dubai seemed the ideal location for our honeymoon  As well as the chance to veg and relax by the beach  we wanted to mix it with sight seeing and a bit of activity and be able to do things at night like go to the cinema or go to a few bars The Hilton was absolutely ideal with its facilities  amp  location on Jumeirah beach  With it s private beach guarded by the hotel s security and its pool  you can be as lazy as you want or try your hand at the water sports available or use the    hour gym It s also a more chilled out hotel that although it s got a complete mix of couples  families and groups  it never feels as though it s been invaded by the       rowdy element The rooms are in very good condition and the sheets are turned and replaced everyday as is the complementary water  which is essential   You ve got to be careful of what type of room you get though as you can either be looking at to the sea or the Walk complex or at a building site I would recommend going B amp B as the buffet breakfast is huge and caters for every nationality  Staying Full board is a bit of a waste as there are so many restaurants in Dubai and the general area to suit all tastes The staff are very attentive  professional and incredibly friendly  We were given free drinks and cakes when the staff realised it was our honeymoon Bars and restaurants in Dubai are mostly placed in hotels  so you ll find yourself jumping a taxi and hopping between hotels to try them out  The     at The Jumeirah Beach Hotel  the Wave  and Buddha Lounge at Grosvenor Place are just   good bars nearby while Frankie s  Frankie Detorri and co Pierre White s restaurant  is just   mins walk away  The Hilton itself has some really good restaurant and bars with the BICE italian  Pachango and the Sky View bar for amazing views of the beach and sea For shopping  there are malls within    minutes by taxi including the Mall of the Emirates with the indoor ski slope  the water park Wild Wadi is close by and next door to the   star Burj  A   mins taxi ride takes you into Dubai city centre where all the famous souks  markets  are I recommend the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah to anyone who wants to visit Dubai and after going to a few of the hotels in the area for a quick drink during our stay it s certainly the best one on Jumeirah Beach in all aspects  
P =>  Well worth a visit We stayed  a family of five  in an executive suite  the hotel was excellent in all respects The executive lounge is good and the complimentary food and drinks well worth the upgrade costs  Also included is a free transfer from the airport if you book a executive room The whole experience was good and we felt very good value for money except for one thing only and that was the food which was very very overpriced in our view  What was included eg executive lounge and breakfasrt was superb but f you wanted to buy lunch or dinner or drinks it was very expensive for a family budget  We went to the Malls and local areas to eat and it was the same costs for five as it was for two in the hotel  Incidentally we flew with Qatar Airwas and they were superb 
P =>   It s not luxury but it is very good My wife and I stayed here for two nights  the others were at the Hilton Dubai Creek  and were rather impressed We checked in very late  almost  am  and as HHonors Gold members were upgraded from a Deluxe Plus room  one above lowest  to full Lagoon suite  and also given access to the Executive Lounge  this was in addition to getting the       HHonors points through MyWay   Usually lounge access doesn t mean very much but at this property it is well worth paying for  A decent full breakfast  free alcoholic drinks between  pm and  pm and food served throughout the day  Puts a number of Hilton lounges in the US to shame  The service was really rather good and one of the staff members remembered our names  asked us how our day went etc etc  Top notch The room itself was pretty sizeable  about the size of two normal rooms plus the hallway between the two  One of the rooms was a living room and overlooked the beach area  The bedroom itself was facing more inland  but was at the end of the building so it didn t face any construction The area immediately around the Hilton is full of what appears to be finished but yet to be occupied buildings  Within walking distance there is significant construction  which affected the roads getting to and from the hotel  taking place but we didn t hear any noise whatsoever Overall was rather impressed with the hotel  As I put in the title don t consider it luxury but it is a decent place to stay  and good value too  For any Hilton HHonors members out there the recognition is excellent  
P =>   Treat yourself to an executive room or suite I stay in hotels for too much of my life  During the week I spent at the Hilton Dubai Jumeriah  I experienced some of the best and most consistent hospitality I have enjoyed at any hotel around the world We booked an executive room as the extras you receive from Hiltons are normally worth the premium cost   we were not disappointed Transfers to and from the airport are complimentary  in the   series mentioned by other reviewers The executive lounge is large with friendly hosts and provides an excellent breakfast  afternoon tea  evening canapes and refreshments  with alcoholic drinks between        amp          Rooms are the size and quality you would expect from a hilton  Service around the pool and beach is good and includes the provision of ice cold flannels and water melon during the day The only minor annoyance during the week was the insistence of some hotel guests to rise at the crack of dawn to reserve sun beds and then not put in an apperance till the afternoon  While this did not inconvience us  a few guests that arrived mid morning were denied beds by the neatly folded towels and token personal possession  We eat at a few of the hotel restaurants BiCE is not cheap but you get food of a quality that matches the pricePachanga has a great atomsphere with professional dancers performing a couple of times during the night The bbq food at Wavebreaker is excellent Overall i would recommed this hotel to anyone that values quality and service in a hotel If your looking for bling though  this may not be the hotel for you  
P =>   Good hotel Hilton Jumeirah is a nice hotel  service is excellent  facilities are good  pool is a bit on the small side  Bice restaurant is overpriced and very average  i had a vege lasagna that was about  inch by  inch       i was appalled at the size of the portions  its a good hotel  but dont eat onsite  go into medinat jumeirah  
P =>   Great Hotel Just returned from a stay at this hotel that is located on the beach around    mins from the airport  I can support the positive feedback from other members  The hotel is clean throughout  the staff are first class  nothing is too much bother  There is a good choice of restaurants use on the site  The hotel provide towels for use on the beach  amp  around the pool  the private beach area is clean and tidy and is serviced by a number of staff so you do not have to get up to get a drink   The price of alcohol is expensive    Dirham for a pint of Fosters         Outside the hotel all the building work has been completed only the final touches being added along the  Walk  A number of food outlets are currently being finished or are already trading  these include Chilli s  Ruby Tuesdays  a Mexican  Starbucks  Pizza place  There is also a bank opened opposite with an ATM in the foyer All in all a fine place to stay with the developments outside adding to the experience  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to other members  
P =>   excellent staff at this beach hotel Stay at this hotel as part of a two centre holiday in Hong Kong and Dubai  Enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much  I had already stayed at the Oasis Beach  which is next door  previously so knew what the area was like  There are very high buildings behind the hotel and there is still a lot of building work going on but this really not a problem so don t let this put you off  The bedrooms are large and immaculately maintained  We had breakfast and dinner included in our rate and enjoyed the food in the buffet restaurant  The main positive feature of this hotel is the staff  They are excellent  always pleasant and deliver a first rate service  The beach area is lovely and loungers and sun umbrellas are plentiful  As mentioned in a previous review red flags are placed on all the beach pool tables and you just put the flag up for someone to come and take your order for drinks or food  You can also sign for everything so there is no need to take cash down to the pool or beach  I would definitely recommend stayingin the Jumeirah Beach area if staying in Dubai as it worth paying extra to stay at the beach  There are also plenty of watersports available  
P =>  Standard Hotel with a heart Although I tend to go for modern design hotels I must say I quite liked the Hilton Jumeirah  You can tell it s a child of the   s with some recent renovations  but they have kept it up with much devotion making it a very pleasant beach resort away from the city  Having said that  there is quite a bit of highrise bulding going on  throwing their shade on the beach at certain times  Service was excellent  If you have the choice  go for limousine pick up from the airport  You get a brand new BMW   series for peanuts  
P =>   Brillaint     I have just returned from a week in Dubai  staying at Hilton Dubai Jumeriah with my family Hotel is fantastic  Real   star  Its in a great location  right on the beach  With a great pool and gardens There is a lot of building work going on in the area  but we were not bothered by it at all  They thought it added to the overall excitement of Dubai Staff are brilliant  very friendly  they cant do enough for you  On arrival our credit card was swiped so that they could charge everything to our room which was great and meant we didn t need to worry about carrying money around with us The hotel room was large and very comfortable  With massive beds  mini bar  satellite TV  Iron  hair dryer and tea and coffee making facilities  Good size bathroom with bath  shower and toilet  We also had connecting rooms which was good The hotel  rooms  grounds and beach were all immaculate  and facilities were all spotlessly clean We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis  but ate in the hotel   out of the   nights  We ate in the  Oceania Restaurant  which was a buffet  their was plenty to choose from and the food was gorgeous We also ate in the  BICE  restaurant  this restaurant serves Italian food and has been voted one of the best restaurants in Dubai  The food was fabulous  though is expencive  but you do get what you pay for Breakfast is buffet style  They have everything to choose from including bacon which I didn t expect to see in a Muslim country  Snacks are available all day at the pool bar and beach bar  Drinks were great  you could get everything including Guinness and Fosters  Also they do brilliant cocktails  All alcohol is imported so it is a bit expensive  If you are thirsty on the beach all you have to do is put a red flag up and the man on the beach buggy will be over to take your order The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to malls and gold souk The gold was an experience and the gold was expensive  but worth having a look      By far the best bargains are to be had at the fake market at the  Al Karama Centre   You just need to tell the man in the shops that your looking for fake designer bags  shoes  sunglasses and you will be taken to a secret room  probably in a different building  and you will enter designer fake heaven  We loved it We visited  Mall of the Emirates  on several occasions  it is fantastic  and has shops there for everyone on every budget  Also so in this mall  is  Ski Dubai    it a definite must whilst in Dubai  you don t have to Ski  you can just go into the Snow Park  which was brilliant  My sister tried skiing  discovery lesson  she said was fun but her muscles ached for a few days after     We went on a Dow cruise  on the creek  We cooked it through the tour rep  it was great  the food on board was good and to see Dubai creek all lit up was brilliant We also had afternoon tea at the  Burj Al Arab   It cost about     each  but worth every single penny  The afternoon tea is actually   course  Champagne  Tea   coffee   chocolate  selection available   Sandwiches  Beef Wellington  Sorbet  Scones  Berry Basket  Cakes and Sweets  The hotel is breath taking and the afternoon was defiantly a time I will remember for the rest of my life We booked and flew to Dubai with Virgin Holidays  We flew economy class  which was fine  The entertainment on board was great  and the seats were comfortable The weather was great  always in the high    s  low    s  We come back with a brilliant tan  but I really did think it was to hot some days to sit on the beach  but the malls are always cool ha haAll in all we had a brilliant time and would go back tomorrow  
P =>   wonderful wonderful hotel stayed here from  th apr to   th apr the service at this hotel is second to none nothing was too much trouble with all staff members rooms very clean breakfast buffet was well presented and plentiful cherry on the cake are the two restaurants  quot la pachanga quot  and  quot bice quot  service excellent food to die for 
P =>   Great hotel This was our first time to dubai and we arrived at the hotel at      in the morning  although stated on the website the rooms arnt ready till  pm we were told that we could go for breakfast first and then they would make sure our room was available and it was at     am  We booked an executive room    nights  which entitles you to use the lounge in the evening for free drinks and snacks  cant remember exact times   The rooms were comfortable and we had a view of the beach  The staff were exceptional at all times and nothing was to much trouble  The pool area is not as large as I expected but there is a pool bar and in the dubai sun the cool water of the pool was a godsend also while round the pool they have staff coming round with iced towels which was a nice touch  We did use the restaurant on the beach which was ok but we found that the room service was excellent  The hotel is situated on the beach but when we were there the weather was so hot that we didnt venture down there  After our   nights at the hilton we stayed at the burj al arab for a treat that hotel is bonkers and although fabulous I would say that the staff at the hilton were even better than the burj al arab  and the hotel was much more relaxing  I would highly reccommend this hotel and I would stay at the hilton again fabulous   nights    
P =>   Good Hotel   Enjoyable Stay We stayed at the Hilton at the end of uary      and enjoyed the stay  I think it is important to remember that this hotel is one of the cheaper beach front options on the Jumeriah Beach  If you base your expectations with that in mind   then you will not be dissapointed It is a modern clean hotel   with a good beach  Dining options are good  rooms are a good size  clean and modern  Either side of the hotel is a bit of building site   but its Dubai   so expected  The good news is the buildings behind are all complete   but on either side its pretty messy   so try to get a room which looks out onto the pool Overall it is a good quality hotel and would reccomend the hotel if you can get a good deal    or if your budget cannot stretch to the LRM We enjoyed the stay but would probably try another hotel on the jumeriah beach next time  
P =>   Excellent choice  Although I am sure there are other hotels in the city that are just as nice  this hotel proivded an EXCELLENT beach view  awesome staff  and plenty of relaxing time  They have a great fitness room and the Skyview bar was excellent  We have no regrets staying here for the two nights that we did  Would go again  
P =>   Good Hotel           lacking that something special My partner and i recently stayed at the Hilton for five nights in one of the executive rooms enjoying access to the executive lounge This hotel looks like a typical      s Hilton building but they make a huge effort to disregard the first impressions  Dubai houses some amazing hotels in terms of design and service so the Hilton feels more practical than  fantastic hotel   We could not fault the service  all staff were friendly and the excellent beach service etc was pretty much as good as we have experienced in other first class hotels   resorts  Things such as fresh fruit being brought to the room made a good impression and we had a good room which did not overlook the construction work The hotel lacks a good ambience and when you visit some of the other hotels in Dubai the Hilton s faults are immediately apparent  The hotel is at the edge of Jumeirah Beach but is close enough by taxi to the main locations  Dubai is a great location for foodies and we had some excellent meals including Gordon Ramsay s Verre I would not say don t stay here but be aware of what you are getting  it is not a resort hotel and it could be placed anywhere in the world  it lacks character and ambience  However  as i mentioned previously the service is great and it is a great base to explore Dubai  
P =>   totally fab experience Me  my husband and   year old stopped at this hotel in        The hotel was excellent  the staff really went out of there way for you  we arrived at      in the morning and was in our room by       which was excellent as we had a   hour flight Beers are   pound a pint  champagne        with free strawberries and cream Food was excellant at the oceanic they have theme nights the only fault would be that one night it was fish only which me and my husband didnt like  so therefor had to eat out You are well look after by the hotel staff alike Even the cleaning staff are very courtious  when you are on the private beach there are beach butlers who care for your every needs There is lots for children to do a play area on the beach and a large play room in the hotel  I would recommend this hotel   taxis are cheap and there is a free shuttle bus to shopping mall  Town centre is    mins away no where to walk is the only downside 
P =>   Just superb I stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah for   nights and have to say that this is probably the best hotel I ve ever stayed in  On arrival  though it was morning and check in time isn t until the afternoon  we were offered refreshments and our room was soon ready   before   am in fact The staff in the hotel are extremely friendly and can t do enough to help  are extremely polite and friendly  and this service never waivered once throughout the stay   I really can t praise them highly enough There is a breakfast buffet in the morning with an excellent selection of fruit  breads  cakes  yoghurts and cooked items with chefs on hand to prepare eggs or pancakes as you order   nothing pre cooked and sitting under lights as in so many other places Just outside the back of the hotel is the pool and this leads into gardens which run onto the beach   plenty of sun longers were available and there are bars serving drink and food in all   areas   there s also a life guard and security guard on the Hilton s private beach but the latters should never be needed as Dubai is just so safe  Theer are also different restauranst and bars within the hotel for alternative day or night eating and drinking The city should be about a       minute cab ride but given the traffic in Dubai  give yourself at least   times that long depending on the time of day   still  the cabs are extemely cheap as they only charge for mileage covered and not waiting time  shame London cabbies can t do the same There is in general a huge amount of building work going on in Dubai but we wasn t affected by any noise at all in the hotel and we had a sideways beach facing room  If you can look beyond the cranes and building sites  seeing what s actually going on and being built is quite futuristic   and there s still original areas around the creek that offset the modenity of everything else I found Dubai to be an enjoyable place to visit for some winter sun  summer is unbearably hot  with extremely friendly people and very safe too   as said  the Hilton Jumeirah was just superb and I d have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and am already looking froward to returning next year   I just hope they can maintain such lovely and high standards  Without doubt    stars from me 
P =>   Best Holiday ever Hotel  Hilton  Dubai  Jumeirah BeachDate of Visit             for   DaysVisitor  Surrey  EnglandOur visit the Dubai was the best holiday we ever had  there is so much to see and do in Dubai  that   days was not nearly enough  a good excuse to visit again very soon The hotel was fabulous  the restaurants were as good as a top London eatery  book early if you want to go to the more expensive restaurants  as locals use them as well as hotel guests The beach was beautiful and very clean  The staff couldn t do enough for you  We staying on the new executive floor    which has its own private dining area  with drinks  breakfast  and unlimited food on offer all day and night  I suggest spending a little more and using this floor  but if the budget cannot quite reach   floors  the other rooms are just as nice  with pleasant staff Overall a fab place to stay  even the tall appartment behind the hotel don t phase guests  by       lots of shops will be opened in the area  making it a small piece of Canary Wharf in the sun  Valentines Day is a very special night for all  book for their beach tent experience the evening of valentines  it s beautiful Can t wait to go again and we will be staying at the Hilton  
P =>  Loved the Hilton  The Hilton Dubai Jumeirah whilst surrounded by construction was able to maintain its high quality service  cleanliness and staff with a smile Being greeted with a refreshing fruit cocktail after an overnight flight  and a hot face cloth is exceeding expectations and was a wonderful start to our stay Room service is on point with great food   delivered hot as was their laundry and pressing service where they are returned to the closet in the time stated The beach service  restaurants and bars gave almost limitless options but the cat s cream was their wonderful Spa facility located on the mezzanine floor  Wonderfully tranquil good value and delivering exactly what it advertises  What more can I say   Definitely try it for yourself  
P =>   Winter in Dubai My husband and I stayed at the Hilton  Jumeirah for a week at the end of uary  There was a very friendly welcome  the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous throughout the whole hotel   they couldn t do enough for you  The room was very spacious  including a    bed  amp  balcony overlooking pool and views of the beach and Gulf  the view also included other very tall buildings and a plot of land  not yet built on   I appreciated the fresh orchids in our bathroom  the decoration of the bed with shells every day and fresh fruit left in our room  The private beach was lovely  as well as the landscaped gardens where we relaxed in the double hammock  As mentioned in previous reviews  the pool is generally in the shade but most afternoons we swam in the sunshine   pmish   We ate at Pachanga s  Latino   and Bice  Italian  which we would recommend  Bice Sky Bar had lovely views across the Gulf  lovely for an evening drink  I had a fantastic massage  reasonably priced  and was treated like a princess  once again the small touches made the difference  ie the massage was followed by some time relaxing in lounge overlooking gardens with a tray bearing glasses of sorbet and chilled fresh pineapple juice   Courtesy buses were provided by the hotel which went to the Mall of the Emirates  amp  the Gold Souk  The cabs were very cheap and were the best way to get around town  walking wasn t very easy as there was so much building work being undertaken across the City   In conclusion  we would definitely recommend this hotel for a winter break  
P =>   Always a pleasure to stay here The Hilton Jumeirah is always a great hotel  We have stayed here   times and it always delivers a great experience The staff are fantastic  facilities are great  location is perfect We stayed in a suite and although it is quite pricey you do get what you pay for The Hilton always makes us feel right at home Also a big thank you to Roy in reservations for assisting with a very short notice visa application  
P =>  Great HOtel   Pity its in Dubai  Lovely hotel   very clean  excellent staff   very helpful and friendly   just hated the fact it was in Dubai   This city os not for us  nothing could prepare us for just how much construction is taking place   its awful feels like the place has no soul Still dinner at the Burj Al Arab was magnificent and worth the visit just for that one experience  
P =>   Nice Hotel Nice Hotel service good  Shame about all the building work going on in Dubai  Was there for one week   th     th  we picked the one week that it rained for   days  Still warm though but wet and cloudy  Rooms clean and tidy the staff could not do enough for you  As this was my first trip to Dubai did not realise how expensive the city is  Shopping fantastic  I took my daughter  food and meals out great  I would suggest a visit to the cocktail bar Jumerah beech Hotel  The best way to get around Dubai is taxi s the bell boys will signal for one as soon as you step outside the hotel  
P =>   this place is not exceptional but it s ok  We spent   nights here in mid ember on the way back from the Maldives  This hotel is ok if you need to be on the beach and you want a good   star standard  In fact it s probably the best value for money beach option in Dubai at the moment if you don t mind being in an unexciting part of Dubai  Whilst everything you d expect from a    beach hotel is there  the Hilton lacks that something special  Whilst architecturally appealing  it now looks somewhat  undersized  against the backdrop of a veritable  wall  of drab looking new apartment blocks which will be ready for occupation later this year  The plot on which the L shaped hotel sits is rather narrow and it s flanked by empty plots on either side  The higher your floor  the better your view of the Palm Island which is still taking shape  At weekends the adjacent sandy plots are where builders labourers come to gawk at us semi naked tourists as well as the families of expats who park their  WDs as close to the beach as they can I ll start with the positives     The F amp B manager was great  giving us special attention  at least    minutes a day   almost as if he suspected we were habitual tripadvisor critics  he conjured up porridge and houmous pittabread at breakfast specially for us every day      They have one of those excellent DIY fresh orange slicers juicers    The terraced gardens that lead to the beach are pleasant     The beach is well serviced with no shortage of loungers  and it s definitely safe  Unlike hotels closer to the bridge to Palm Island  there are decent waves here and the water is surprisingly clean considering all the Palm Island construction work that has been going on for the past     years      The hotel is clean  as are the rooms  all hallways had just been newly carpeted for example      Our king bed was very comfortable    We arrived around   am and got a room after just    minutes waiting time     Bice  restaurant comes recommended as one of the best in Dubai  looked very good  we didn t try it however      Most guests seemed to be adult couples   not many kids at allHere s where I see room for improvement at a hotel that charges     pounds a night or more  a  Breakfast buffet can get crowded in the mornings  Some plates were old stained scratched  The F amp B manager assured me they were due to be changed during       I suggested sooner  b  There is nothing in the vicinity of the hotel to walk to   apart from other  more expensive  mostly nicer   hotels along the beach  in due course the ina area will offer restaurants and nightlife  but strolling there through today s construction site would be far from romantic  c  Free shuttle bus to shopping malls is a great  and necessary  service  On one occasion we called from the room to book   seats  We were told it would be there in     minutes so we needed to hurry  We were downstairs within   minutes but they had let the shuttle depart without us  We can live with this  but the attitude of the doormen could have been more sympathetic  d  The guests in the adjacent room had     friends with them from   pm to midnight and we were not able to drown out their raised voices by turning up the music in our room   sound proofing could be better  e  The hotel checks guests as they enter the pool area   a common procedure to keep non guests from using the beach facilities  but there s got to be a better way of recognising resident guests f  we d recommend requesting pool view rooms and preferably a high floor as the view towards the other  front entrance  side is of empty  sandy plots of land  g  the well shaded  by the L shape of the hotel  pool area is uninspiring  all tiles and not much vegetation  and it is too distant from the beach where most guests choose to be during the day  So there s no atmosphere  Hilton Group  ship in some potted palm trees and liven up the place with pool activities  or a decent happy hour  In summary   this hotel is ok  but I ll be spending a little more next time to stay somewhere that has more of a resort feel  I d recommend the Habtoor Grand five properties along the beach to the right for example  their gardens are     times bigger and their pool has a resort ambience  plus   championship standard tennis courts   Or of you want significantly better value for money and the beach is all you re after  then try comparable properties in one of the neighbouring emirates such as Ras al Khaimah  
P =>   a little oasis in a big building site After booking our room I mailed the hotel to see if they have airport transfers and found out we could have free transfers   BONUSOur flight landed on time but then it took about a hour and a half to clear customes and get our bags I was sure our lift would have gone but NO the guy was still waiting for us  From the outside your heart sort of drops as there is still major building work going on around the hotel  plus the exterior of the hotel looks drab  Once you enter the hotel lobby it is completely uplifting and inviting We arrived at the hotel at about     am we knew that we d not have a room but that was ok  As we were on the executive floor we were told to help ourselves to breakfast in the executive lounge  There was a good choice of hot and cold plus you could ask for any sort of eggs you required Our room was available at about         not bad at all  The room is called a two balcony suite so I kind of assummed if you had two balconies you d be looking out over two different vistas  how silly  The room actually has two balconies as it used to be two rooms which they knocked into one  Don t get me wrong it has been done very well and doesn t look like two rooms  You have an entrance lobby with large wardrobe  iron and board  safe  bar area with coffee machine  kettle  fridge e t c a good sized lounge area with a chai and sofa bed which was ready made for our   year and balcony   Then in the bedroom is a good sized king bed  arm chair and wardrobe and balcony    The bathroom is a good size but needed a little maintenance  Some grout has come out  is comming out of some tiles the shower door doesn t fit properly it is just starting too look a little tired   nothing major yet though  The bathroom can be entered either from the main bedroom or the bar area  The view from our balcony was over a building plot that hasn t been started yet I would like to think that it will be made into gardens for the big new residential block which has been built behind the Hilton BUT I don t know  if more buildings go up there it will effect all the rooms along the one side   maybe ask for a pool view to avoid this  BUT you would be able to see and hear it from the beach This hotel is really only suitable for beach sun lovers as the swimming pool does not get much sun at any point through out the day  Although in y and ust when it s    odd degrees I m sure this is a welcome cool area On the  rd floor is an indoors kids club from  am till       where you can leave your kids that are      years old  On the beach there is also a bouncy castle and two play areas  On the beach by the life guards hut is a big bucket with buckets  spades and other beach toys We mainly ate in the executive lounge as after breakfast they serve soft drinks and hot drinks all day  Then afternoon tea is served with sandwiches and scones  pluse a few other bits  Then         pm beer  wine and some spirits are served with hot and cold canapes We did eat at the beach cafe the food was good  averagely price for a hotel On the whole a very good hotel the staff were all very pleasent and helpful  The internal decore was very good  Personally I don t think I would return again in the next few years until I knew what was happening to the plot next door  Saying that many of the hotels along Jumeirah beach are in the same situation  
P =>  excellent choice stayed here for   nights  then went on to phuket and satyed at holiday inn  see seperate review for that if interested  from the time we checked in  until the time we left  it was like being a king   my self and my wife thoroughly loved our stay at this hotel  the staff can not do more for you and are always smiling  the bell boy who bought our bags up was great  told us about the room facilities and then had a really good chet with us about the local attractions and advised of things to do as i wanted to get things done withing the small amount of time we had    if you want to go to the gold souk  you can either catch the free bus which leaves at     am or      am  or catch a taxi  taxi s are metered and really reliable  if you decide to take the free bus  make sure you register this with the concierge as many people had not decided to do this and were told they could not travel as others had booked their space    this is clearly communicated on the form we were given     it is approx    dhirams to get to the gold souk and well worth a visit  just to see what is around    food is great there too  if you fancy traditional indian food  meena bazar  is the place to go  which is a boat ride from the gold souk for   dhiram each     we had room service the  st night we were there and the food was beautiful  could not fault it    the workers are so helpful and they are wlays wanting to help you with any questions you have we visited dubai marina one evening and ate at an indian restaurant called rupee room  if you are stuck for a place to eat and fancy a good indian restaurant  try it out  its amazing   its also nice around the marina as there are a few things to do and the sights are wonderful  if you would like any other info about the hotel  feel free to mail me at sants   msn com and put hilton dubai in the subject field  We are looking forward to going Dubai again and staying at the Hilton again  EXCELLENT      
P => Well worth a visit Hilton Jumeirah Stayed   nights from   th      upgraded to executive sea view room which was well worth the extra money  this gave us access to the ex lounge for breakfast  afternoon tea  free alcoholic drinks and snacks from        every night and free soft drinks in this lounge throughout the day The staff were extremely helpful  the rooms were spacious and spotless The skyview bar is well worth a visit  the views are fantastic and the surroundings are plush It has a swimming pool and own private beach  you wouldn t have to leave the hotel for anything if you didn t want too There is building work going on all around Dubai  however it didn t interfere with our trip at all Dubai and the Hilton Jumeirah are well worth a visit  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel and Staff Stayed at the Hilton Hotel on Jumeirah Beach last week with my husband in an Executive Room on the  th floor and booked on a B amp B basis  The hotel itself is wonderful with lovely rooms  fantastic beach facilities  great restaurants and the staff are the best we have ever experienced  We ate in a couple of the restaurants  but our favourite was the BiCE Restaurant where the food is out of this world  The staff cannot do enough for you and this made our holiday and we will definitely stay at the Hilton when we return to Dubai  Lots to do and see and taxis are plentiful and cheap so don t worry about getting about  The hotel also has a complimentary shuttle service to and from the Mall of Emirates and also into the Gold Souk etc  The beach facilities are great with plenty of sun beds and again the service from the staff at the beach bar etc was marvelous  Can t wait to return   
P =>   Fantastic hotel but a big building place around it Stayed   nights for a reward stay  Everything about the hotel was fantastic  The pool and beach area also  There is not much more to say about that However the surroundings are a mess due to the building scene  This did not bother us at all  but it did take some of the glimmer from the hotel  But afterall  it is just temporary  
P =>   best hotel     we stayed here for   nights and i have to say its the best hotel i ve stayed in so far  the staff are wonderful and are always there when ever you need them for anything  The beach is fabulous we ate at the bice restaurant and food was great  we also went to the bice bar which has great views and the service was great to  anyone who goes to this hotel will not be dissapointed  i m already thinking about when to go back next year    what i do know for sure i ll be staying here again     
P =>   Excellent We stayed at the hotel for three nights on our return from Thailand  The service and food were excellent  We ate in Bices  the Italian restaurant and it was brilliant  The food was some of the best I have eaten and we travel the world  The last evening of our stay we ate in the South American restaurant and again the food and service were outstanding  I do agree the toilets are easy to block  The Bices cocktail bar on the tenth floor has a lovely ambiance and the bar staff are very attentive and good at their jobs  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel  
P =>   Wow  We stayed at this hotel for the  nd part of our honeymoon  it was bril  The staff were amazing and two small disagreements were dealt with straight away  I was sick for a day and   members of staff   including the manager rang to ask my husband how I was doing thoughout the day and brought something up from the pharmacy  We had fruit and champagne as we were honeymooners and the staff were excellent  Room service was good also  They always rang afterwards to see if we were happy with our food  Swimming pool  the sea  the activities   all very good  restrurants of a great standard also  Only gripe was that the toilet was easy to block  Would recommend the venue to honeymooners  singles  couples and children  free shuttle to the shopping malls   amazing   what service      
P =>   Worst in Dubai I have traveled throughout the world for many years and this hotel which is classified by Hilton as one of their top level hotels throughout the world might be showing that Hilton is losing their touch  The food that I ate at the hotel amde me sick to the point of me not being able to leave my room for two days and their only response was it was not their fault and here is your bill  The only calls I received from the hotel was the chef so he could say that Hilton accepts no responsibility for my sickness  This only goes to show not only the bad food  but a lack of service or concern for their patrons  Stay somewhere else while you are there and it makes you wonder in what direction Hilton chains are headed  
P =>    Wonderful hotel with super friendly staff and service  This was our second visit to the Hilton Jumeirah Beach hotel and we were delighted to return  The staff are extremely friendly and efficient  The room was always sparkling with endless fruit delivered to the room daily  We had three kids with us whom thoroughly enjoyed themselves especially the breakfast which started them off on a high note every morning  The beach is beautiful and with the all the water sports available it is just impossible to get bored  We have booked our third visit for next year already  
P =>  Fantastic Location We stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach for   nights  following   nights at the Hilton Abu Dhabi  It is an ideal combination and so easy to travel between the two  a taxi cost only     This hotel is amazing  the location right on the beach means no worry of crossing roads or using under passes  We had a deluxe sea view room which was spotlessly clean  The king size bed was Huge  Also had a relaxing easy chair with footstool  coffee table  complimentary fruit on arrival  mini bar tea coffee making facilities replenished every day  Bottled water replaced every day  Safety deposit boxes are free of charge and you set them with your own combination Complimentary Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries replenished as they are used  The restaurants are superb and I especially recommend the buffet style as the themes have something to suit everyone and the choice is vast  At     per person it is also very reasonable  The restaurant by the beach and pool is also excellent serving lovely barbecues at lunchtime  You can also have your meal served to you on the beach by the waiters in their little beach buggies The rooftop bar is fantastic for the views and do go in the evening with all the lights it is magical  The business centre is open    hours a day for ayone travelling on business this is a bonus  Internet use is expensive however at    dirhams per    minutes  approx        you also have internet access in all the rooms The hotel is approx    minutes from the mall of the Emirates by taxi or shuttle     minutes from the souks The new ina which is being built will be within easy walking distance although at the moment it is like walking through a building site If your customers are looking for a relaxing holiday where they can stroll of an evening day then recommend Abu Dhabi and they can visit Dubai for the shopping  
P =>  Great Hotel   Bad Food We spent   nights at the Hilton Jumeirah with our   year old son  We had a nice sized room that was kept wonderfully clean and stocked with bottles of water and fresh fruit  The breakfast each morning was exactly the same but was very good with good service  we were on the Hilton Honours Floor so it was included  The staff were fantastic   very helpful and friendly but they kept wanting to get us a fixed rate taxi instead of a metered one which was quite a bit more expensive so be aware of that and just say no  There are plenty of metered taxis that are very cheap While the hotel is a Hilton  it is above average compared to your normal Hilton   the decor is nicer  the rooms feel newer and better decorated etc etc The beach is nice and the water is clear and warm but there is nothing much to do  The kids club is inside upstairs so we gave that a miss  There are a few water activities you can pay for but nothing of great interest   no snorkeling  jet skis The biggest complaint we had was the food selection  There are two restuarants outside which is where you want to sit since inside is freezing cold  The food selection at these two restaurants is awful   a couple of salads  fried food  burgers and the usual chicken nuggets and fries for kids  After a week  you lose the will to eat  They will order you anything of the room service menu but then it takes an additional    minutes to be served The pool is also very dissapointing  The way the hotel is built  it shades the pool for most of the day so even in the warm climate  the pool is colder than the ocean and its just plain boring  Big kidney shaped pool  So if you are looking for a fun poolside area with slides for the kids and fountains and the other goodies you get at  quot resort quot  hotels  you are not going to find it here Would I come back again   probably not but then I wouldn t come back to Dubai  It was a great place to visit  but don t need to see it again  
P =>   Much quieter now  We have just returned from our third stay at the Hilton Jumeirah Dubai The extensive building work on the Jumeirah Beach Residence has all but finished directly behind the hotel  and is now concentrated towards the Sheraton to the West and Le Meridien Mina Seyhato the East  When you sit on the beach  you are not aware of any building nise at all  although the pool area did seem noisier Being a Hilton Honours Diamond VVIP we had use of the Executive lounge on the  th floor   this has finally been extended and is now double its previous size  This is a vast improvement Our reason for choosing the Hilton Jumeirah  apart from being a HHonours member  is that it has one of the best Jumeirah beaches withan unobstructed view over the ocean   we used to stay at the Le Meridien Mina Seyha  but found the view to be obstructed by the continious building work on the Palm Jumeirah The only downfall of the Hilton Jumeirah is the lack of taxi s that are available from the hotel to other points in Dubai   next time we will definately be hiring a car In previous years the hotel has been very busy  especially at UK Half Term time   although this year it was much quieter and more peaceful   looking forward to go back next year     
P =>   Good Average Hilton Stayed here during Ramadan  One of the bars was kept open discretely  Overall the hotel is quite small by Dubai s modern standards and and it is dwarfed by more modern properties around it  However  the hotel is right on the beach and the rooms and public areas were very pleasant indeed  I found the staff to be polite and helpful  The food is excellent and there is an excellent gym  The important thing is that this hotel can be booked for a reasonable price directly from Hiton s web site  and this is a big bonus in a shockingly expensive city  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel Stayed for   nights with family in march       Well run  good facilities  great beach and pool  Although expensive the restaurants were very different and food fantastic  particularly the South American grill   We were upgraded to the executive floor and had   junior suites which were very large rooms indeed  There were balconies with views of both the sea and probably the busiest   hr construction site in the world  We moved here from another inadequate hotel in Dubai  it was a great relief and salvaged an otherwise miserable waste of   K  
P =>   ten out of ten Went to Dubai for Xmas      and decided to return for birthday treat  Picked this hotel because we spotted it on Big Bus Tour  All round this place gets    out    from us  Staff are all up for the  quot can do quot  attitude  Perfect pool and beach environment  Forget the building going on next door you mostly will not notice it  Definitely going back  
P =>   Good hotel pity about the city I traveled to Dubai on business last month and arrived at the Hilton Jumeirah after an overnight flight from Switzerland  The staff were most welcoming and the hotel was a pleasant respite from the hot and dreary drive from the airport  The room was a good size and appointed as you would expect from a global hotel chain like Hilton  so full marks there  The garden and beach facilities were Eden like after spending some time in the city proper  which was a major disappointment because of the incredible amount of construction  which resulted in noise and dust everywhere  and the insane volume of traffic  I could definitely recommend the Hilton Jumeirah for a first class beach vacation  but if you re looking for culture  tranquility  the chance to explore a charming city     it s probably best to head somewhere else  
P => Hilton Jumeirah Stayed in the Hilton Jumeirah                     Very nice clean hotel  Buffet breakfast was excellent and filled us up for the day  You can have as much as you can eat drink We were at the hotel during Ramadan but established we could still eat at one restaurant at lunch time and order endless drinks on the beach throughout the day anyway Excellent beach and warm waters of the Gulf  Beach staff very friendly bringing free ice cold flannels to cool us down  Free towel use The free shuttle bus to the city and malls were a great help and we used this nearly every evening to go to the shops restaurants    get your name on the list in the morning for the evening shuttle as places are limited to one mini bus full  The hotel restaurants are quite expensive but the Mall of the Emirates and Ibn Battuta mall  where the bus takes you and picks you up  are crammed with restaurants such as Pizza Express  KFC  lebanese  pizzas  veg and Chinese outlets Rooms cleaned thoughly each morning  Staff very pleasant  My only criticism is that the internet  quot guestlink quot  did not work in my room TV  Thus I had to pay   AED for half an hours internet use in the business room  I only wanted to use the internet for   minutes to check in for our return flight home online and having expected a guestlink internet service in my room  I had to pay what I thought was a lot of money for just   minutes use  minimum buy was    mins  Other than that  great hotel and would recommend to all  Taxi ride from the airport cost    AED     AED goes straight onto the taxi fare if you catch one from the airport    ride took about    mins Driver knew exactly where to go  Plenty of taxis from outside the hotel to take you where yuo want to go  Would recommend the Dubai Big bus tour which picked up outside the hotel  took us to then city  free river cruise and then back along the beach tour to the Hilton Pool very busy but always got a lounger on the beach  
P => lovely hotel stayed here in a normal luxury room for   days at the end of tember  what a fantastic stay it turned out to beAlthough the drive up to the hotel might be a bit off putting what with all the building work around  your soon in a fabulous hotel where the staff cant do enought to help you and are so polite and at your beck and call whenever you need them We were greeted with juices on arrival and given a room on the  th floor  not a great view  onto the restaurant and lobby roof  but you could still see the ocean Rooms themselves are spotlessy clean and attended to every day  fresh fruit is replaced daily and your bed is turned down every night Breakfast buffet was perfect and had most types of foods europeans would be used to eating  also ate in one other restaurant La cantana  which was a south amercian establishment  decent food but nothing to get too excited over pool area was lovely  if not a bit crowded  but go down the steps and your on a perfect beach with hot ocean water  This was our favourate place to chill during the day  There was also a bar down beside the pool for drinks  snacks etc Staff were very friendly at all times and you were always greeted with a smile   hotel itself is a little bit older than most in the area and it sticks out a bit compared to the massive towers surrounding it  we decided to walk back to the hotel from a nearby bar we visited but this is not to be reccomended as there are hardly any paths and you risk gettin run over by a taxi driver If you are coming to the dubai i highly reccomed you stay here  especially if you can get a decent room rate  we paid around      p n   I couldnt see myself paying      p n though as there is just too much choice in dubai when it comes to hotel  All in all if you do decdie to come here i promise youll have no complaints 
P =>   okish hotel but great beach This hotel is at the end of the Jumeirah beach stretch of hotels  the service or food isn t great  staff aren t very attentive and the hotel is quite old fashioned  The beach however is great and the pool side area is fab  the masseuses at the hotel are quite good as well Its not a wow hotel but would recommend it for someone whose looking to enjoy the beach  amp  the Jumeirah ina area at an affordable price and isn t too fussed about being in a fabulous hotel  The marina is nearby so food or entertainment should not be a problem  Emirates Mall and Ibni Batuta Mall are the closest malls  It will take about an hour to get to the hotel without traffic   
P =>  Truly a favorite haunt My year here in Afghanistan is quickly coming to a close and since I ve spent several short breaks at this hotel over the last year  I thought I d comment on my numerous stays at this property I just returned from a split week in which I stayed in an Executive Room at the Hilton Dubai Creek and then an Executive w Alcove Room at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach  I think I have a great perspecitve having so recently stayed in both First the great  Hilton Jumeirah Beach sits on one of the prettiest beaches in the world  especially when you think of its proximity to such a large thriving soon to be metropolis  The beach is super clean  great service  lots of chairs and the water in the outdoor showers is refreshingly cold  compared to the bath water temps of the ocean  Although pricey  the restaurants are incredible  Pachanga is the Latin Place on the Mez floor and has some of the most incredible creations I ve ever eaten  The Italian  quot Bice quot  on the ground floor is also very good as is the  quot Oceana quot  in the lobby  During Ramadan there is a special Iftar tent set up just off the Oceana and near the pool that served typical Arab  end of fast  meals nightly  Very good and reasonable in price compared to the others  The Sky Bar was closed for Ramadan which was a shame only in that  it is one of my favorite hang outs when in town  I stayed in Room     which was on the corner overlooking the pool from the large balcony and floor to ceiling glass windows looking out at the sea  The sunset from my room was stunning  The room was big and featured an easy chair  writing desk and massive bed The staff and cleanliness of the entire hotel are probably the two highest points as they seem to always go out of their way to please  The Executive Lounge has been expanded with very nice snacks in the evening and plenty of spirits Now the bad  which really isn t that bad compared to other places  but in Dubai you just expect more  First and foremost is the     AED charge per day for in room internet is rediculous when you ve upgraded to the Executive Room  The bathroom is very small in these rooms compared to others in the city that cost less  Agree that there is often noise from nearby flushing toilets and I could never adjust the water just right to suit my comfort  The provided flip flops only come in one size  huge  which is tough on feet of smaller visitors  not to mention dangerous  As you can see  I really don t have that much to complain about and will be back to the property in   days because it really is my favorite place to hang out when I ve got more than    hours in Dubai  There is a lot of construction going on around and except for the occassional worker trying to sneak across the beach  turned away by security   there s very little disturbance  The traffic pattern to the hotel is in constant flux which often confuses cab drivers but other than that   a great time  
P =>   Fantastic We had a fantastic holiday  We stayed for   weeks and its the best holiday i have ever had  The staff made us feel like royalty  They just couldnt do enough for us  The weather was HOT       everyday but endurable  Fantastic for sun worshipers  The desert safari is a must  but dont book with holiday package  you can get it much cheaper in the malls  
P =>   It s a Hilton I m staying here at the Hilton as I write this  I m HHonors diamond and stay at a load of their hotels around the world  but starting to think that I might branch out because it s getting rather boring  and must agree with the review below that said it feels really  quot Hiltonish quot   Don t get me wrong  it s just fine but really nothing to write home about  I even got upgraded to a suite which is fairly large and the bathroom is decent but it feels not unlike an Embassy Suites or something  I guess for here in Dubai I expected something a bit more luxurious  especially for the price  but I should have expected that being a Hilton it d be pretty standard  It s surprising that they couldn t build a hotel here that was at least as good as the one at the airport in Copenhagen       
P =>   Long Term Guest I m just finishing a one month stay at this property  I chose the Hilton because it was close to my work at Jebek Ali Port and I get HHonors points  As a business hotel it is excellent  The staff is attentive and friendly  They keep the place spotless  But as a long term resident  and one who will return  I feel I can point out some of the nit picky things about the hotel My main complaint is plumbing  As I was usually the first on my floor to start a shower in the morning  I had to wait for the water to get hot   They obviously don t have a circulating system   Then the temperature control drifted as other users came on line  They should install scald proof controls  Finally  every time the guy next to me flushed  I heard it like it was in my room  I m sure I was doing the same to the guest on the other side  They need more sound insulation in the walls around the plumbing chase  I also wish the mirror had those heaters to keep it from fogging up  Is that picky enough Onthe good side  they recently re did the executive lounge  There is now a larger selection of goodies but I wish they would bring premium brands of liquor up the lounge  Also  they put in two comoputer deaks but still want to charge for their use  the Crowne Plaza doesn t in their exec lounge   Make them free  That s why you pay extra for those rooms All this said  I m going back for another month because the staff is just so darn friendly and helpful  
P =>   Good but very Hiltonish We stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah for   nights at the beginning or ust  HOT HOT HOT   As with most Hiltons it was     Hiltonish  There wasn t anything special or different about this one  The staff were excellent and friendly offering great service but with so much to do in Dubai we were really only there to sleep and eat breakfast and it served it s function well  We did have a slight problem when we came to extend our stay by   night at the end of our holiday  we didn t want to come home   We confirmed our reservation for the additional night on the phone  then in person at the front desk but when it came to our last  extended  night we found the key cards had been deactivated  Luckily I found someone to let us in to our room and rang reception to explain but they insisted they had to see us in person and then accused us of not leaving when we should have  Upon checking their records they obviously found this was their error but we felt the situation could have been dealt with better  We stayed on the Hotels private Beach for a couple of hours one day which we found to be clean and well maintained    it was so hot while we were there     degrees one day   that we didn t spend a lot of time away from Air Con and going in the sea really is like swimming in bath water  We didn t manage to get close enough to the pool for a refreshing dip as it was ridiculously busy so if you re a pool sort of a person get there early to avoid disappointment  The loungers were comfortable with someone always ready to jump in to lay your towels down for you  The Beech bar served delicious  massive  fresh coconuts for about      bargain  But if that wasn t refreshing enough then a guy came round with Iced  Lemon Scented  towels for us which we thought was an excellent touch We didn t visit the hotel with a view to staying there very much as we wanted to pack as much in a possible during our stay and Dubai was great  It is  at the moment  pretty much a building site   everywhere you look  including out of our room window  there are massive sky scrapers going up and properties being built  Although they seem to work pretty much constantly there really isn t any noise or disruption but visually it isn t very pretty   fascinating but not pretty Be prepared to take Taxis everywhere  There are hundreds of them and they re all really cheap so it s not an issue at all but with the building work and the heat you d be lucky to complete a    minute walk in one piece The best places close to the hotel are approx    taxi ride away at the Grosvenor Hotel  Bar    there is great for sunset and cocktails  they ply you with olives and nuts too which I always love  It s supposed to have    types of Champagne too if you fancy a treat  Next door is the Buddha Bar which looked great for dinner  book a table  and the bar snacks sushi are great as is the atmosphere The Italian in the Hilton  Bise   is supposed to be excellent but we didn t have a chance to try it neither did we visit the Hiltons Sky Bar as it was undergoing some refurbishment maintenece  There are lots of restaurants bars in the Medinate Souk which has a very nice Arabic feel  unlike the other shopping centres which are massive designer stockists with chains of Starbucks Wagamama type eateries  Sadly we ran out of time to visit the Gold Souk which was a shame but maybe next time  While we were in Dubai we visited the Wild Wadi Water Park which was great fun and an excellent way to keep cool but not as big as you might think  or maybe waterparks just felt bigger when I was a kid  We got a snow park pass       for Ski Dubai which was also great fun  maybe more so if you actually ski which sadly we don t but we made full use of the  quot tubes quot  and sledges The Al Jumeirah Mosque was beautiful but unfortunately we got the wrong day for a tour inside so missed out   check with your hotel which days they do the tours  If you do take a trip out to the Mosque and need some substenance after  check out the Lime Tree Caf   as you leave the road the Mosque is on turn left at the juntion with the main road  They have an excellent brunch menu and serve big portions  I couldn t finish all the smoked salmon that arrived with my eggs  It s a great place to people watch as it seems to be the Jemeriah es  WAGs  favourite meeting place  a permanent coffee morning with gossip a plenty  On our last night we visited the Burj Al Arab which is the  self proclaimed     Hotel for Cocktails and Tapas  It s  quot Free quot  to get in but once there  there is a minimum cover charge of     Dirhams  so basically you have to spend approx     each when you re up there    we didn t work it out this way but we spent about     between us which got us Tapas to share    Cocktails  a Glass of wine and a Beer  It s worth the visit just to say you ve done it but I really couldn t see what the fuss was about    the coloured lights made it look a bit    s disco and although the service was wonderful we experienced the same excellent standard of service throughout Dubai  After looking at the Hotel website I can see why the Hotel itself is considered awesome  with the services they provide and the underwater themed restaurant  but if you re just going for a drink  a bar is a bar  We made sure we walked out rather than get a taxi at the door to fully appriate the architecture up close  it really is a masterpeice and well worth the very short stroll We broke up our journey home from the Maldives with this visit  see review for Olhuveli Beach  amp  Spa if interested  and were grateful for the split in the flights  I don t know whether it was the massive contrast between the beauty and tranquillity of the Maldives and the dusty  hustle and bustle of Dubai but I felt a little disapointed with the Hilton Jemeirah  If you can stretch to it the Jumeirah Beach Hotel next to the Bur Al Arab looks awesome  we went in for a coke after Wild Wadi  we did try to get a room there for our extra night but they were fully booked  I guess it all depends on what you want from the holiday  and if you re a spoilt cow like me   O    Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy ed  your holiday whatever you decide ed  to do  
P =>   Cant wait to go back    We came back from the jumeirah Hilton   weeks ago and had to write a review as we found all the others that people had written so helpful  We booked with virgin and upgraded to premium economy at the airport which was great as their was a special offer on and we got two upgrades for the price of one  As soon as we arrived which was about  am our room was ready we had an executive corner room which was on the fourth floor  floor to ceiling windows on both sides overlooking the sea  this was great as we were all tired and hadnt expected it to be ready til  pm  The room was great  fab dressing area and big bathroom  Loads of toiletries in the bathroom right down to shampoo conditioner body lotion toothpaste  amp  brush  razor etc  The staff are brillant so polite and helpful and nothing is too much trouble  There is a great games room for older children which our thirteen year old found which was perfect for when he got too hot outside which was quite often   It has playstations and table tennis etc and big leather couches in The food is great  no complaints and for anyone going who likes seafood try the oceana restaurant in the hotel on seafood night  lobsters and prawns everywhere The rooms were spotless  as was the hotel and pool and beach Only one little moan  halfway through our holiday they decided to put new sunloungers out at the pool  We watched them doing it one night from our balcony andnoticed that they only had half the amount of new sunloungers as the old ones  This caused mini chaos the following morning as not everyone got to sunbathe at tthe pool  I m afraid we resorted in the end to getting up early and putting the towels on the beds to save them  Not something I m proud of but needs must   We did the desert safari and I confess I was one of the few people that didnt like it and was nearly sick as were quite a few people so think twice about it   But my husband and son loved it  I loved this holiday and hotel and am just about to book again at the Hilton for ch  Dubai has got me hooked 
P =>   Superb Hotel Superb hotel  with excellent staff  clean  amp  spacious beach  The rooms are super  make sure you go for the executive rooms  gives you free high tea  two hours of canapes and drinks in the evening  Also the executive lounge recetion staff will advise help organise anything for you The building work behind the hotel in nearing completion  Our room looked west across the near Jumeirah Residency  and the work never interfered with our stay   all the work at this stage is being done inside   do not let it put you off staying here The BICE restaurant is top notch  and the Wave breaker restaurant has excellent specials on   the  quot shrimps quot  on offer during our stay wouls have costed three tiimes as much in UK and were massive The Concierge staff are excellent and will drive you to whatever destination  if you are waiting   min  for a taxi  in a hotel Lincoln Town Car  v  plush  for less than a normal taxi  Top guys If you stay here and are disappointed I will be very surprised  
P =>   Good beach great food A nicely situated hotel with a good beach and good food outlets Close to media city and not far from everywhere else  The staff are really very goodBook an executive floor and avoid the masses who bag beach and pool chairs before dawn  also avoid the sports bar on the ground floor  its yobby The bus tour of dubai departs from outside the hotel and is a good way to see the city  although the commentary is littered with how great the ruler is  
P =>   Loved it totally fab   Myself  my husband and our    year old daughter stayed in the hilton for a week in july       We loved it so much  The hotel was fab throughout and we will compare every hotel to it again  it was situated on a private beach but because the weather was so hot we didnt really use the beach until after dark and even then it was like going in to a warm bath  The outdoor swimming pool was chilled which was so lovely as the temperatures were over    degrees celcius every day  The service was excellent  they took care of your luggage  they got you your pool loungers  they took your drinks orders from your pool loungers  they gave you frozen flannels as you sun bathed  fab   Theres a swim up bar in the chilled pool with under water bar stools where you could have a cocktail and lunch and snacks  There Were a few bars and restaurants in the hotel also to suit all tastes  The hotel also had a childrens club which was situated indoors during the hot summer months in a lovely playroom  The breakfast was delicious and had everything you could ask for from fruits to pastries to hot foods and a special omlette station  We booked it with     hotels for     euros which we considered a bargain as the luxury hotel made it a holiday of a lifetime  
P =>   OK As this has been my  rd visit to the hotel within   years  There have been some major changes to Dubai with the construction and the amount of high rise building popping up every where The hotel itself is exactly how i remember it  with the inclusion of seating outside under tents  The hotel facilities are ok  including the dining we all ate at wave breaker and the BICE  and found the BICE to be lovely  We had the chicken absolutely superb  The beach was fantastic  but the pool got so busy around midday there wasn t anywhere to sit  If possible they should some how increase the size of the pool  The rooms are beginning to look a bit dated and worn  the cleaner do so much and the staff are very polite and prompt  Check in and check out was smooth and even tho our flight was a morning flight  we still had our   rooms deluxe sea view  interconnected as requested Would i stay there again probably not  only because i have already   times  its time for a change i think  
P =>   Fantastic  I stayed here   nights with a child Having spent    years travelling on business holiday and staying in hotels in Europe and the Middle East  the Hilton Dubai Jumeriah has to be one of the best  if not the best  hotel I have ever stayed in From the delicious breakfast buffets  to the friendly staff  the free internet connection  the well equipped gym  the cooled pool and the direct beach access  this hotel excels in all fields  Even the small things were appreciated like  complementary mineral water bottles everyday  the ironing board with iron  the super quick room service  the kids playroom and the complementary shuttle services to the malls The only issue was the check in  which was a bit confused as there were no separate queues for those cheking in and those checking out  However  this was a minor issue and I would definately stay here again  
P =>   Heaven on earth A month on and I still cant believe that such a fabulous place exists  We had stayed in the Hilton Dubai Creek for the first half of our holidays and then moved out to the beach resort  All I can say is FANTASTIC    It is the first hotel I have ever left and literally CRIED that we had to go home  It might also have something to do with my boyfriend proposing on the beach on the last night  But the fantastic service  range of restaurants and overall ambience was breathtaking  So much so that we are planning on going back for our honeymoon    A          
P =>   impressed The good reviews that this hotel gets from other guests are fully justified  I found staff exceptionally nice and friendly  but not in a too formal way  more the warm and welcoming kind  which I found especially interesting as I believe such friendlyness can not be trained  Hotel staff seems to be genuinly happy and kind  The hotel complex is nice although a bit dated  The beach is just spectacular and the ridiculous highrises that are now right behind the hotel actually ad to the cool and funcky vibe that Dubai is all about  I never swam in seawater this clear and this hot  what a trip  so much fun  But Dubai is way way too hot this time of year and the heat is just brutal between the hours of    and   pm I stayed in a fabulous large suite on the executive floor that was clean  cool and quiet  Beds are wonderful  Roomservice was quick and good quality and not too expensive Check in in the club floor lounge was a disaster and took ages  I really dont get the point of being sent to the top floor to be checked in  but having to wait for an hour because other quests are in an argument with the one person on duty there  What a lousy welcome  Checkout  on the evening before having to leave in the early morning  was also a mistake as the bill did not include the last night and I was stopped at the frontdoor to still go through a less than classy checkout at the frontdesk  But anything between check in and check out was perfect The free limo  for club floor only   to the airport was a fabulous touch  
P =>   Functional Hotel  Great If You Don t Like Glitz Another country  Another Hilton Hotel  We stayed at the Hilton on Jumeriah Beach for   nights on a half board basis  The hotel is one of the  older  less awe inspiring hotels  It could easily fit in with somewhere like Tenerife  It is at the far end of the beach  There are only a few properties between this and the Sheraton  Another fast and efficient check in and we were shown to our Executive Room overlooking the really nice pool area  beach and finally sea The room was large and had two double beds  a good size TV  easy chair and desk  The bathroom had two sinks  a bath and shower  Well stocked toiletries and everything worked perfectly  The hotel had a clean feel in all areas  this was especially true with the room  The air conditioning worked really well considering the soaring temperature outside  For those of you that go on holiday to watch TV there are channels which show American movies and dramas  The mini bar prices are not too high and this was one of the only Hilton Hotels that I have not sampled the room service  The menu was a simple affair with something for everyone The pool area is really well designed  All apart from the pool being in the shade for some of the day due to the L shaped design of the hotel  There was never any trouble finding a lounger and the tiered section added to privacy  The beach is really spectacular   not a hill for a million miles We ate in the buffet restaurant for breakfast  A typical international affair  Everything was in hot and nothing ever ran out  I am not a big breakfast eater  but everyone seemed to enjoy it  We also ate in the buffet for dinner on   nights  A different theme each night there was never any reason to go hungry  I found the waiter service restaurant  you can use your half board option for credit in here  was a much more clivilised affair  Beautiful bread  pasta and other italian dishes it s well worth a visit I think Dubai is the ultimate destination for self gratification and really does attempt to offer something for everyone  From skiing to shopping  We did it all  a personal favourite for me was the duning in the  x  tour  Be prepared for the village they take you to for dinner   it s not the    you are used to A functional hotel   it s beauty only eclipsed by the spectacle of all the other amazing hotels on the beach  Why not save a few pennies by staying here and then go to visit the others for dinner drinks  
P =>  Excellent    Fantastic  Having worked in one of the world s finest hotels  I know what top class service quality is and this hotel exceeded all my expectations  The staff were incredibly courteous  friendly and nothing was to much trouble  Our bedroom was extremely clean and of excellent size  Facilites were just perfect  The private beach is very clean  and despite the incredible    degree heat the beach butlers are always on hand to bring you what ever you want ed with a beaming smile  I would really recommend this hotel as one of Dubai s treaures  
P =>   WOW             Booked   nights at this hotel as a treat for my wife s birthday  particularly the Hilton having stayed at many others worldwide  haven t been disappointed yet   Quite simply the best five star hotel we ve stayed in so far  even outstripped Taj hotels  for those of you who are well travelled  Can t say more than that  Impeccibly clean and fresh  with attention to detail for maximum guest enjoyment  Really friendly staff management throughout  spontaneous service  permanent smiles and nothing too much trouble  You really get the feeling staff actually enjoy themselves too and will go to great lengths to provide whatever you need  Complimentary bottled water and fresh fruit were provided in our room daily  together with a turndown service early evening  We were even suprised with a birthday cake There is impressive  round the clock building work ongoing throughout the city  you can t escape it  However  the hotel hides it well and rooms are so well insulated  you don t hear a thing  All things considered  quite impressive how they keep it so clean  Sea view rooms are recommended  although the only rooms that have ONLY a sea view are the executive suites  Nevertheless  good luck to you if you can sit on the balcony for any length of time in that heat Didn t eat too much at the hotel  but then we never do as we prefer to enjoy the local culture  However  breakfasts were very enjoyable and other guests spoke highly of the various restaurants at the hotel  Otherwise eating out locally is mainly internation cuisine at other hotels   the famous Budda Bar is a must  and there is a complex of restaurants at the nearby ina including Persian  Lebanese  Indian  Italian  Japanese and Chinese Thai   a taxi to the marina will cost you about       and a meal approx       per head  although we found most non hotel restaurants don t serve alcohol  Private beach is lovley and clean  but a dip in the sea is like taking a hot bath  so we tended to relax around the pool area upto about     am   frankly you have to take frequent dips to cool off  even at     am in the morning  Pool is very well managed with lots of staff to provide frequent drinks to replace that lost fluid  Pool staff provide you with iced towels to freshen up and complimentary chilled melon from time to time  An excellent range of freshly made  healthy option fruit smooties are delicious from the poolside bars   a meal in themselves Mid afternoon was mid to high forties  so good luck if you can stand staying out in that  The alternative is an afternoon shopping trip to one of many state of the art Malls  or perhaps hire a limo for a trip out  don t worry about the cost  a limo   chauffeur booked through the hotel costs    DHRs an hour  approx       Alternatively  taxis are all climate controlled and rates geared to GPS navigation  so you pay for the distance  not so much the time   and really cheap  petrol is cheaper than water    Try to find time to experience a dessert safari in a  x    it has to be done   again  the hotel will arrange for you  All in all  an absolutely pleasurable stay at the Hilton and some fantastic memories  Highly recommended  
P =>   Brilliant stay  I am not a big fan of Hilton hotels  after New York Hilton i was not impressed  but this one was brilliant  the staff were friendly  always smiling bending over backwards to help all the time  It s in a private location  right on the beach  which is nearly always quiet  The stay was perfect  No complaints at all  The food at PICHANGAs  mexican restaurant  inside Hilton is amazing  For a woman that has very high standards for hotels i was impressed  I would DEFINATLEY come back here again  P S   there is construction around the hotel  but your ll find this all over Dubai at the minute  but that didn t bother us at all  
P =>  Could Not Be Better Just returned from the Hilton Jumeriah in Dubai  what can i say  it was fantastic Like many other people i had read the reviews concerning all the building work  this really is not a problem around the hotel now as much of the work is done  roadworks are still in place as the Dubai ina being built behind the hotel is still going on  It all just adds tot the appeal to see all the work that is happening throughout Dubai The Hilton is a fantastic place  it is not a massive hotel which gives it a very friendly atmosphere  if you read through all the other reviews one thing stands out and that is the customer service  The staff can not be rated highly enough  every one off them will do all they can to make your stay the best possible The rooms are excellent with everything you need  the food is outstanding  the Oceana is buffet style with different themed nights Pachanga has a mixture of tastes from Mexican  Cuban and Brazillian  BICE is a superb Italian  a bit pricey but well worth it If you venture away from the hotel to eat be prepared to travel as there is nothing on its door step  this is not a problem as taxis arecheap  the only drawback is unless it is a licensed place they will not sell alcohol e and y is vey hot  the sea is like a bath at a constant    degrees  so the pool is the only respite from the heat All in all a fantastic holiday and i could write pages of stuff on how good it was  if you are thinking of going you will not be disapointed  The Hilton is by no means the most expensive and oppulant hotel in Dubai  but i think you will have to go a long way to beat the customer service and atmospher here  
P =>  Excellent Hotel and Staff This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in  I was there for   nights on business  The rooms are way above average   though I would hesitate to call them luxurious  They were kept very clean by the excellent housekeeping staff  Any time I called housekeeping for something it arrived immediately  The gym is excellent and I did not try the spa  but it was tempting  The pool is very very nice  though I wish part of it was shaded for those of us who do not worship the sun  The beach area was also very nice  though I do not think highly of Dubai s beaches in general  I did not try any of the restaurants  but did enjoy the service at the bar next to the lobby  I don t have any complaints  Please note that Dubai is in a constant state of construction and  yes  you will probably be able to see hear construction from just about any hotel room in the city  There was construction outside my window  but other than some faint beeping of trucks backing up  I was not bothered by it  The  quot partial quot  sea view is very partial indeed  but you get to see a good stretch of beach and some water in addition to the monster buildings at Jumeirah Beach Residence if you stay on the side of the building I did  Taxis are easy to get  at least in e  and we had no problem with traffic  There is a great Lebanese restaurant nearby in the Dubai ina where you can also get sheesha  
P =>  Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In    Booked this hotel through a staff travel scheme as I work within the travel industry    got it at a good rate and thought I would try it out What an excellent hotel  As soon as you arrive  the staff are friendly and attentive and come straight to the car  help you with your bag  Something happened with our booking  but the reception guy   quot Roland quot   was EXTREMELY helpful and solved our mistake in the matter of   minutes Arrived in the room  excellent sea pool view   Rooms were clean  big  and had every amenity in there  The beds were very comfortable too  The porter arrived with our bags  and he knew it was our first time in Dubai  and he explained EVERYTHING to us within   minutes   What to do  Where to go  How do get there  Very helpful  Pool area clean and big  also has its own private beach  Food at hotel was excellent  room service was delivered within       minutes  Staff were VERY VERY friendly  every morning you got a  Good Morning  and all throughout the day you get a hello  The hotel staff also rang me once as a courtesy call to check everything was ok The whole experience was excellent   have been a little overpriced but you expect that for a HiltonWill definetely used this hotel again   Recommended to all    
P =>   Excellent beach hotel Excellent hotel with wonderful staff  Rooms are large and have stunning sea views  Sun loungers are quite close together but the beach area is beatuiful  A bonus is the shuttle bus to Mall of the Emirates shopping centre  
P =>   Top Class Having read the reviews I wasn t worried about staying at this hotel  I stayed here for a week I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anybody The staff were all so friendly and helpful   they are fantastic There are a number of restaurants in the hotel and I could not fault the food or service in anyway  Just down the road from the Hilton is a Hard Rock Cafe   the food   drink here is great and very reasonable too There is a bar in the Lobby of the hotel which has a happy hour from  pm     pm nightly and the drinks are half price  Again the staff here were great too  There is also a bar on the top floor of the hotel with an outdoor area which is worth a visit for a cocktail or two When sunbathing the staff will locate a sun lounger for you and will move one to a preferred location if you wish  Towels are provided for use by the pool beach to all guests and iced towels are also provided daily  Drinks and food can also be ordered from the beach or pool area  reasonably priced  SPA   The hotel also has a SPA  There is a very varied choice of treatments which are priced similar to home but the treatment you receive is excellent  I would recommend paying them a visit A shuttle bus runs from the Hotel a few times a day to different locations i e  The Mall of the Emirates this is free of charge  If a taxi is required the hotel will organise a car for you The construction work which is pictured a lot in the reviews is almost complete  Outside the hotel it does have a lot of work going on but the work will not interfere with your holiday Overall this Hotel is great and would choose it again if returning to Dubai  The staff are excellent the food  amp  facilities are also excellent  
P => top class Booked last minute and a bit worried about other reviews   particularly construction around the hotel  It is scary when you first arrive but once there you really don t notice it  Hotel is brilliant   staff superb  food excellent   BiCE is a must  Best Italian restaurant outside Italy we ve been to Kids loved it   laready plannig next visit  
P =>   Fab   Excellent Service We got a taxi from the airport and arrived at the hotel just before  am and even though check in was officially  pm  we were able to check into our room  during the check in we were given a lovely fruit cocktail Our room was facing some building work  i think nearly every hotel in dubai has some form of building work nearby  but also had a sea view  There was a little bit of noise during the day but it didn t affect us at all  however about   hours after checking in  a member of staff arrived with a bottle of wine and glasses with a little card apologising for any noise from the building work  A few hours later somebody else arrived with a vase of red roses for the bedroom and bathroom  A few hours later we got back to the room and there was a chocolate cake with plates and cake cutter in the room and then finally when we returned in the evening there was a bowl of fruit  this also came again the next day  and a leather hilton box containing luxury stuff dates   a delicacy over there   We also had our towels and sheets changed twice a day  We felt really spoilt getting all the little treats We had breakfast included in our room rate which was lovely with a great choice on offer  as we arrived early we were allowed breakfast on our arrival day as we were leaving early for our departure  We also ate at the beach bar in the evening which was great and had room service meals too  also great and great value Facilities were great  the hotel was very clean and well maintained Finally  I just wanted to say how the staff were just so welcoming  friendly and polite  I have travelled all over the world including Asia and the Caribbean and these were the best staff I have experienced  
P =>  Best Hilton in UAE This is the fifth time I have stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah Beach  As with every other time  it was an excellent experience Being a Hilton Diamond VIP  I have always been upgraded to a suite  and the suites are EXCELLENT  This is not a new hotel  but the executive rooms could be in any new built resort  Further  the interior of the hotel is well maintained and without the scuffs and flaking that you find in older properties that are trying to squeeze every penny out of the facility  This hotel is CLEAN  Everything in the rooms works like its supposed to  Our room had its own espresso maker  bless the heart of whoever thought of that   and not some wretched tea kettle and instant coffee  This is an extremely well managed hotel that gets the details right and has a very well trained staff  In   stays the only non positive experience was an overbearing fitness center receptionist who was less than polite in asking my wife if she was a hotel guest  I sent an email to the hotel from my room mentioning that  while I did not feel it was a serious problem  the management should be aware of it  The hotel general manager sought out my wife and apologized   certainly not necessary  but a sign of how serious the management takes guest relations The beach is clean and the water superb  The beach and pool staff  especialy Ly   are attentive and friendly Construction  Yes there is a huge amount of construction  and since the first visit this has been prominantly proclaimed on the hotels website  The construction does not continue at night  and during the day the noise was never enough to disturb in any room we stayed in  Most of the construction will be completed by the end of the year  I found it interesting to see a city full of skyscrapers being built  and it didn t detract from swimming or lounging around at all The only real negative I can point to is the price has risen substantially  but even so  it is still good value for money  especially if you have a hilton VIP card  and since Hiltons reward system is the best of all the hotel chains  you definitely should  Also  unlike many Dubai hotels  getting a visa is a breeze  The hotel handles this efficiently and for a reasonable price Lastly  this is a great family hotel  Our children LOVE Dubai and staying at the Hilton  They constatly want to go see Theresa at the  quot Kindergarten quot   kids play room   and the staff treats the kids great   when our   year old fell asleep at the table in Pachanga at dinner  the staff scooted two chairs together and got pillows and a blanket for him to sleep while we finished our meal  Thats typical of the treatment kids get at the Jumeirah Beach Hilton  
P =>  Great Hotel with a nice beach Initial impression is that your in the middle of a construction zone  However  once inside the hotel you forget about what s going outside  We stayed   nights here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay  The staff are friendly and attentive  Spent a lot of time on the lovely beach that the hotel has  Great selection of food at breakfast as well  Room sizes are a good size and we had one facing the beach so we couldn t hear any of the construction at any stage  Highly recommended  
P =>  Good Hotel but       Just returned from staying in this hotel  Stayed for   nights  First night we were given a room facing the building works with a partial view of the sea  The building work was so noisy and we could not relax on the balcony  We complained and were moved to a room facing the pool and again with a partial view of the sea  not full view as promised by our travel agent   The hotel was dwarfed by the surrounding towers  This did not put us off  as the facitlties within the hotel are excellent  The staff at this hotel are extermally helpful and polite  Buffet style breakfast is full of choice  fresh fruit  cereal  pancakes  etc  We did not have our evening meals in the various restaurants within the hotel complex  They were expensive and very formal  The hotel provided excellent shuttle service to and from various Malls  Malls in Dubai are not particularly cheap  In my view prices are about the same as in UK and majority of the stores can be found in UK  Traffic is a major problem as you head into the heart of City Center  Allow plenty of time if you travelling into Bur Dubai  Mina Bazaar and Gold Souk  Eating in Mina bazaar is very  very cheap  On average my wife and I paid               for a full meal  but the taxi to and from Mina bazaar would cost around     dms           Safari is a must  
P =>  a very nicew hotel we have just returned from a six night stay at the Hilton Jumeirah  this is a very nice hotel the service was excellent  the room was very nice the breakfast was an extra         aprox  this was above the normal standard with different coffee available and fresh pancakes etc  the only downside is the building work  we asked for a see view room this was fine  if your on the other side of the building its a terrilbe view  when your on the beach its easy to forget the building work  i would stay here again it was expensive at         per night but its one of the best hotels we have stayed in 
P =>  Above expectations Just back from   nights at the Hilton Dubai Jemeirah   and it really did exceed my expectations  When we first arrived we did ask to move room as ours was overlooking the building work which is on one side of the hotel  This was no problem for them  and our new room was very nice  Nice pool area  great beach bar with good menu and a very nice beach  Lying by the pool and beach you do not hear any of the building work noise  Great breakfast buffet and the staff are exceptionally helpful  very polite and helpful  All in all a very pleasant stay   people need to be careful not to confuse the building work mayhem and noise of Dubai in general with specifc hotels  Hilton Jumeiah offers pleasent surroundings with a reasonable price tag 
P => Great Holiday Have just returned from a weeks holiday staying at The Hilton Jumeriah beach and would agree with the last few reviews but would add if you can book a executive room sea view if you dont want to look out on a building site the little extras you get are really worth having such as a club lounge where you can have breakfast in peace as well as free soft drinks all day and alochol and nibbles from  pm till  pm  All the staff could not be more helpfull and always had a smileWe did   tours booked with Arabian Adventures A City Tour and A Jeep Safaris both very intresting in their own way the safari was great fun and well worth doingWe went to diiner at the Bateaux Dubai which was fine but do leave over an hour to get there as the traffic at that time of night is like the M   on a bad day    Also had a great meal at The Ribb Room at The Royal Merdien 
P => Very impressed We stayed here last weekend for a work conference but also got to spend some time sampling the facilities  Whilst generally speaking  the Jumeirah Beach part of Dubai is currently a huge building site  we were most impressed with this hotel   in particular the quality of the food and the excellent service  Ths staff throughout could not have been more friendly or helpful if they tried and the whole hotel was spotlessly clean  The pool area and private beach were both excellent  I found the food to be outstanding and thoroughly enjoyed their Italian restarant   fabulous ambience  service and cuisine I would love to return to Dubai in     years time when all the building work is done  Had this been a holiday only  the construction going on around the hotel could have been a small problem  a little noisy and not the best panoramic views but       for an excellent stay  Thank you  
P =>  Beach bliss Just arrived back on   rd having spent the week here Was in Dubai last in y    so saw a big change and many new buildings malls  Last time stayed in town at the Park Hyatt which was a great    experience  The Hilton staff were really helpful and knowing it was our wedding anniverary brought a complimentary cake to our room within   mins of our checking in  As loyalty members they gave us comp  breakfast daily  a free evening meal and a cocktail night in the lovely Bice sky bar as they couldn t upgrade us as totally booked up The building noise was heard when we were round the pool and in the garden but once on the beach or in the room we never heard it  Some music around the pool area may have made it feel more relaxing  The buildings are well under way so we quite enjoyed seeing the working progress and the organisation of workers being bused in and out every day The sauna and steam room are quite small but reasonably priced treatments are on offer  We loved the beach spot  safe swimming and life guards on hand  We missed cold flannels being offered and the variety of pools that were on offer at Hyatt The sports bar happy hour daily and the fact that they were happy to bring two plates for sharing a bar snack was good  The other restaurants didn t disappoint Must dos   Have drinks up in the Bice sky bar and take your camera Use the taxis as they are cheap  Book the hotel bus for mall trips Go to the souk medinat jumeirah and eat at the meat company  great steaks Go to Jumeirah beach hotels   th floor uptown bar on an evening for great views of the Burj and great cocktails beers  If you want no building noise at all stay nearer the Burj  We ve had a great holiday and knew what to expect  Main advise is do your homework but overall we were pleased with our stay  
P =>  Great hotel and a great holiday We stayed for five nights in ruary  and found the hotel was immaculate in every respect  The staff could not do enough for you  Try and have a meal at the Bice restaurant  It will cost a few quid  but if you like good Italian food  it is worth every penny  or Dirham should I say   With a choice of lounging in the pool area  the grassed gardens or the beach  there really is something for everyone  And don t worry about all the building work because the doors out onto the balcony were sound proofed  Anyway  the whole of Dubai is a building site  not just around this hotel As a place  Dubai is great for a short break  I would say that five nights is about right for a break which takes in some sightseeing and sunbathing Try and do a desert safari  These can be booked in the hotel  They pick you up from the hotel mid afternoon and drop you back there later in the evening  Great fun  from riding the sand dunes in a  x   to camel riding  dinner  and entertainment  
P =>   Perfect holiday We ve just come back from a week away in Dubai  staying at Hilton dubai jumeriah  The holiday was booked through destinolgy  who i must say handled the whole booking procedure so swiflty  i would highly reccommend them We booked in at the hilton despite being told there is alot of construction work going on around the area  This is very true  The difference in the landscape in the last     yrs is shocking  At The hilton we had a tower room  as all sea view rooms were booked  My initial thought on stepping out onto the balcony was oh my god so noisy  and not much of a view  but the minute you close the door you can barely hear the noise let alone see the view  So to be quite honest it did not bother us at all  We did used to sit out on the balcony despite the noise  and enjoyed it The hotel  and beach area were always so immaculate  The staff were always so friendly  we went with our   month old daughter  She would be greeted with smiles  all day  every day  overall i d say Dubai is a wonderful place for a hol  esp  at this time of the year as it s freezing cold here in the U k but perfect in Dubai  More so if you have little kids  who can t handle a long flight and hot  hot weather Bxx 
P =>  not bad  Just returned from Hilton jumeirah  stayed xmas and new year  Read several reviews and had mixed feelings about going here however it was ok  We usually stay up the coast at Jumeirah Beach Hotel or The Madinat  If you are used to staying at this class of hotel do not go to the Hilton you will be disappointed  however it is worthy of its   star rating  its the others that surpass this rating  Service was excellent  choice of restaurants were ok  Rooms were spacious  exec suites really ok for family of    any more and its a bit of a squeeze  but you dont spend that much time in the room anyway Building work is a problem  You can see it from all rooms even those with  ocean view   The workers start at      on the dot every single day and myself and my family could hear the work begin  the clanking of machines and tools  It didnt affect us too much as we were awake around that time anyway with two young children aged   and    however many residents were complaining The pool was cold as all the new building work completely shades the pool area  All in all our stay was ok  would I go back  the answer is no but I guess I have been spoilt by the previous properties I visited already in Dubai  If you are going to stay here  you will probably enjoy yourselves  it is not as bad as some make out and the service and staff are excellent  
P =>  Supebr Xmas and New Year My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah from ember   rd until uary  rd  We have nothing but praise for the hotel and staff  Much is made of the construction work going on in the area  but everything possible is done to make it a minor inconvenience We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel  
P =>   Absolutely fantastic  Loved it  every second  Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel  or returning  
P =>   Construction what construction Excellent hotel and well up to Hilton standards  The big question is  can you ignore the construction  You must be joking  It didn t bother me a bit  I was here on business anyway  It may well not bother you either  However  don t come under any illusion that it won t dominate your sights and sounds whilst you re here  The ina development is gargantuan  It now looms menacingly over the poor old Hilton  The roads are in a terrible state  hotel access is a bust up single lane assortment of potholes  Note that your balcony view will be of workmen mostly  and their living accommodations which are plonked on the beach in a forest of nissan huts  Access is also compromised  and in the morning you ll waste    minutes forced the wrong way down a u turn to get back onto Al Safouh Road As of last week  despite the rain  work was underway all night with my sleep punctuated by the sound of earth movers beeping as they backed up Again though  the hotel itself is splendid  Bice is genuinely superb  A  for staff throughout  The roof top bar was cute with very atmospheric views of the palm down the coast  Bar deserted even though the hotel was full  a shame  A shame also about the Arabian BBQ on the beach  The welcome letter invited me to this  But deserted when I got there  Staff clearly thought I was mad for wishing to go outside at all  That s the thing about Dubai  if the sun goes in  or the temperature drops to   c  they huddle inside with the heating on Like most hotels here the style is not going to win picky European tastes  The lobby is a bit too shiny  like a grand motorway service area  Loud and cheerful Christmas decorations throughout  The exec lounge is mediocre  on a par with an average airport lounge  Chunky over varnished chairs and tables  Don t come here for a stylish time  Rooms were very good  spacious  good ambience and pleasingly appointed  Pool area fantastic and private beach a couple of yards walk  You ll have a good time here  but be under no illusions about the construction  
P =>   Will return There is a lot of negative press regarding ongoing building opposite the Hilton  and the other hotels along the that stretch of Jumeirah Beach  eg Oasis  Sheraton  Ritz Carlton etc  Having stayed there for the third time in as many years we ignore what is going on opposite and concentrate on what is good about the hotel Excellent buffet breakfast to suit all tastes Will make small meals for infants   sometimes charged to room Friendly and accomodating staff  especially with our   year old boy Beautiful warm sea First class dining   BiCe is as good as ever Pro active manager  Christian  checking on guest s throughout the stay Highly recommend a suite if you can get a deal or can afford the extra Get upgraded to Exec Floor if you drink a lot   there is a payback Negatives cost of bottled water   almost    x supermarket price  when in Dubai  Be careful where you set up by the pool if you want all day sun as the shade moves throughout the day   alternatively go on the beach as you will get the sun all day Limited kid s play area  amp  bouncy castle can get too hot to go on We will return every year unless something changes for the worse  
P =>  Best hotel ever We stayed at the Hilton Jumeriah Beach for just three days during ober       Everything about this hotel was fantastic  The staff were so nice and could not do enough for you  The service was first class and the executive room overlooking Jumeirah beach was excellent  I reccomend upgrading to the executive floor as they had a happy hour well between      hrs and      hrs when all drinks were free and various assorted snacks again free were available  The executive breakfast room was never overcrowded and the choice was excellent  Being in Dubai for only three nights we ate at the Hiltons Bice restaurant on one of those nights they serve Italian food and it was superb  The hotel swimming pool area and grounds are really lovely and every so often a member of staff would come round and spray you with a cooling spray and bring lemon scented ice cold towels  They have a good choice of lunch menus and the portions are enormous  We could not fault the Hilton and really did not want to come home we would definately stay at least seven day next time  I would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone the bedding and the pillows were sumptious and of the highest quality and with full airconditioning we enjoyed a really good sleep each nigh  
P =>   ober      stay We have just come back from a weeks stay at the Hilton Jumeirah  This is the third year running that we have stayed at this resort hotel   the building work around the hotel is still in progress  but is much less than in previous years and was not a problem at all  the only time you noticed it was on the beach  only slight background noise  The hotel and its staff are more than eager to please and cannot do enought to make the stay comfortable and enjoyable We did have an executive suite which made the stay that little more pleasant  although at times the executive lounge was overpacked and more like a kindergarten Overall a great place to stay in Dubai  
P =>   Nights In ober      Spet   nights at this hotel with   other guys  The hotel itself is next to the biggest construction site in the world   I ve been to Dubai for the last   years and the construction is ever increasing  The hotel itself is good  As long as you know about the construction you will be ok  If you don t like construction then either don t go to Dubai or don t book a hotel near the marina  Breakfast was good  Staff were friendly and helpfull  Neithe me or my mates had any problems  If you need any more information then mail me topgun uk     hotmail com 
P =>  Great for a week ignore the building work Just returned from a week in Dubai staying at the Hilton Jumeirah beach hotel and it was lovely We went for   nights at the end of tember on honeymoon and the hotel made our stay special  I am a gold card member but we got an upgraded room  use of the executive lounge  champagne  cake  congrats card and flowers to welcome us  The hotel managed to get us an early check in and collected us from the airport  charged as requested   The hotel is drawfed by the building work behind it but is spottless  very modern and the best Hilton i ve stayed in  and i ve stayed in about   around the world   The staff are very helpful and friendly but not money grabbing  We relaxed on the lawn terraces between the beach and the pool which was ideal depending on which you fancied going for a dip in  The sea is so warm and very salty but has a lifeguard so safe for all  I hired a sailing dingy and this was charged to the room which is very useful and good fun Best bits about the hotel are  food   Pachanga and Bice resturants are expensive  if you have wine  but the food is very good and worth the money  If you really want to go for it then get a cab  about   dr  to the sister hotel  Hilton Dubai creek  and go to the Gordon Ramsey  Verre  resturant  We did and it was amazing  i ve had some nice food in London but that is exceptional   French themed   Back at the beach The Pergoda gives more of a Arbic feel with the shisha pipes and music  The building work is going on all over Dubai but won t detract from your stay at this hotel IMHO  
P =>   Loved the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah Have just returned from my stay at the Hilton Duabi Jumeirah and totally loved it  It s about    mins from the airport  but taxis are cheap enough  so made no real difference  Upon arrival  we learnt that we had been upgraded to a sea view room and if you don t mind the view of a construction site before your view of the sea  which we didn t  then the room was lovely  We had   big beds  bigger than singles  but smaller than a double  and the bathroom had a bath and shower  The staff were totally lovely and helpful   nothing was too much trouble  They take the time to play with kids that are around the pool and the concierge was a great help   booked us dinner at a Spanish restaurant in a nearby hotel  which was lovely  Lots of choice at breakfast  so you won t go hungry and you even have direct access to the beach from the pool area  Although there is masses of buliding work going on in Dubai  it honestly didn t bother me at all when i was in the hotel or sitting round the pool  Lots of nationalities staying the hotel  so no one will feel left out  Rooms were cleaned to perfection and felt totally safe  Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a relaxing  chill out time in Dubai  
P =>   A Wonderful Hotel Shame About the Building Works We are just back    th t  from the Hilton and quite honestly I can t believe what some of the other visitors have written  I agree that the bulding works detract from the appearance around the hotel but once inside there is not a problem  The hotel itself is one of the best that I have ever stayed in  everything about it was great especially the staff  notning was too much trouble and at no time was any staff member any thing other than very polite and helpful Our stay was made even better by the fact that we were upgraded to a suite  very large and impressive with all the comforts that one could imagine  the view wasn t what we had hoped for but this was more than made up for the quality of the suite We ate in the Argentinian restaurant and again the service and the food were first class and not as expensive as I had expected  being very picky I could say that the service was a bit over fussy  The food as I said was very good with a very unusaul and varied menu  well worth trying  I am sure that you won t be disappointed As for Dubai itself  I am sure that it will be great when finished  whenever that may be  For me there is far too much building work going on to make it a thoroughly enjoyable holiday  I think I will go back in about   years time Dubai is a lot cheaper that I was led to believe with some fantastic bargains to be had in the many shopping malls  
P =>   Nice hotel but wouldn t rush back Just back from a weeks stay at this hotel  Hotel was quite nice  not   star but generally a nice hotel  Staff were quite friendly  the food in the buffet restaurant was average  rooms were average too  Couldn t sit out on the balcony due to the amount of building work going on around the hotel and the amount of dust that ends up on your balcony  We plan to go back in a few years time when all the work is done  We thought the pool would have been bigger  only one small pool got quite noisy in the afternoons  if you want piece and quiet go somewhere else  We had dinner at the Burj Al Arab one evening which to be honest wasn t as luxurious as you would expect  with all its green and red carpet and gold on the walls looks quite tacky  This hotel is quite far out for the shopping malls or the city centre of Deira  be prepared for a white knuckle ride from the taxi drivers  This hotel is quite close to the marina which has nice restaurants  the rupee rooms being one which serves nice indian curries  
P =>  Great value for the money My husband and I stayed at this hotel for   nights    t      t   and were pleasantly surprised that the reviews I had found online were spot on  We have previously stayed at Le Meridien the Part Hyatt  and Al Qasr  the latter being the most glamorous and luxurious  as well as expensive  The Hilton does not disappoint  Opting for the executive club rooms is definitely the way to go  all of the food and the service was fantastic  The only two problems we had were with the maid service  they took all day to get to our room for cleaning  and the hot water in the bathroom  you had to place the handle in just the right spot or either blistering hot or freezing cold water came from the shower head   The food was very good in the Italian restaurant and near the pool and beach area  One drawback for all the hotels in this area  including the Ritz Carlton next door  is the incessant construction  Although the windows block most of the noise  the dust and the condition of the roads around the hotels are horrible  Be prepared to feel very dusty when outside  Of course this is a temporary thing  but it is an eyesore when you have a room with a view  
P => Fantastic hotel This hotel is fab  right on the beach with a beach butler to get your drinks    and to spray you with a cooling spray when you come out of the sea  Superb     
P =>  Is It Really A Hilton A further stay here  we chose the Hilton as a Diamond HHonors member and dont wish to travel from the superb Creek Hilton to use the beach  While the hotel is nice and clean  with very attentive staff  the finer arrangements just seem to go to pot  and its pot luck if you can achieve what you need  Fine for holidays and package tours  but for individual stays and business a definate no  
P =>  Loved Dubai and this hotel We stayed at the Hilton JB for   nights and this was no where near long enough  We upgraded to the Executive package and I agree with other reviews it was well worth it  We emailed the hotel numerous times before our arrival and they were excellent and prompt with their replies  Although check in is       we arrived at     am and our room was ready  As we were leaving early morning on day of departure we requested to change that days breakfast to our first day  this was no problem  The               happy hour was in the executive lounge and also in the BICE Skyview Bar  We ony found out by accident that you could go to the Skyview bar also and we prefered the atmosphere in there even though there was very few people in  Canapes are served in the Executive lounge so we went there first and then moved upstairs for the remainder of the time  The free shuttle is great for getting into the city  We found the construction around and about fascinating and intend to return to see the difference in the area when it is complete  It could hardly be heard and no way did it spoil our time at this hotel  We went to the Burj Al Arab for a meal in the seafood restaurant  It was excellent and well worth the money for the whole experience  When we return we intend to do the afternoon tea for the views from the skyview bar  We also did the Big Bus Tour and the Desert Safari  I recommend both  The Big Bus is an excellent way of seeing the city and beach area if you are there for a short period of time  We intend to return to Dubai but it will be for longer than   days and I would not hestitate to stay at this hotel again  
P =>   Absolutely perfect We stayed at the HDJ for   nights in early   What a hotel  Ok  so its not the flashiest hotel on the strip but their service is second to none  All staff we encountered were so professional and really did their best to ensure that your stay was as pleasurabgle as possible  We upgraded to Executive at check in and it was well worth it  Loved the beach and the guy in his quad bike travelling around through all the beds  pandering to your every need and of course  the iced towels and water spray were very welcome too  We liked the location  yes it is a bit of a trek to the city but being by the beach was worth the journey and with the shuttle service  it s a handy trip  The highlight for us was Friday brunch at the Burj       a must if you like to pamper yourself and it really rounded off the trip perfectly  Brunch means every conceivable gastronomic delight you have ever heard of and as it buffet style you eat as much for as long as you wish  expensive but would do it again in a flash  If you are thinking of treating that specal someone  book it on online before you go as it s very popular Did the dune bashing with Arabian Adventures  excellent tour and it included all drinks and a lovely meal Make sure you check out the sports bar in the hotel  we left it a bit later in the week and discovered there was a happy hour from   to    pm where all drinks were half price  So we have lovely memories  so good in fact  we are already planning our return trip in       
P =>   Fabulous worth upgrading Spent two weeks at this hotel and loved it from the minute we stepped foot out of the taxi Greeted with Tropical Fruit cocktail whilst our bags were taken up to our room Upgraded on arrival to the executive floor  well worth the few extra pounds Breakfast was silver service on the executive floor  you need to sign in for this so only exec floor members allowed  Fresh coffee menus on table no food request too much trouble  You can eat at the other restaurant on the ground floor but this was a self service buffet breakfast Also in the upgrade was afternoon tea served from   til  pm  Well worth it just for the English Tea  scones with fresh cream and other varied selections of fresh pastries  Mini hor doerves also with chilli dipsHAPPY HOUR also included from   til  pm  U name it they had it  Crisps nuts on the tables  I certainly got my moneys worth in Baileys alone  without afternoon tea or breakfast Pool food is fab and the staff are only to happy to fulfil your every request  Glasses of ice were always getting dropped off on their way past you along with melon and iced flannels Trip out on Safari is worth it tho not for the light hearted  Few times I thought our jeep was going to roll over Take a trip to the market  blag gear is all behind secret walls  or you walk through the back of a wardrobe into another aladdins cave  quite funny really  be sure to haggle Amazing rooms and food  I would definately upgrade if you can  I only knew of this by someone on my flight  so worth the money  Staff are great especially at the pool  Everywhere is spotless clean Building site outside but no noise at all  
P =>   Excellent I was a little worried about staying at the hotel after reading quite a few negative reviews on this site  But  I haven t got one negative comment to say  The hotel is spotless  the rooms are perfect and the variety of restaurants are vast  You must eat in the Bice and Pachanga  the food is excellent  We enjoyed a night in the Sports bar sampling a number of cocktails including a flaming B    The construction work is not a problem  you forget it s there  It is a little worrying when you drive upto the hotel  but there isn t any need to be concerned We went to Verre  Gordon Ramsey s restaurant  in the Hilton Creek and it was fantastic  well worth the      for two  including wine  
P =>  loved the hotel a lot of people have been saying bad things about the hotel  we stayed for    nights and loved every minuite of itthe staff are very   friendly and couldnt do enough for you  the food was great  the pool  the rooms were all really nice we had a sea view with all the building work going on  we never really heard much of it  so the people who are complaining must be really hard to please  it was even featured on holidays from hell      why i dont no  the hotel is lovely dubai is just a wonderfull place  all year sunshine and now direct flights from Glasgow which is a added bonus so anyone who reads the bad reviews dont be put off as there is not a thing wrong with the hotel  just ask for a sea view  and then you wont be facing onto the towering buildings  
P =>  From poor beginnings to stunning endings We arrived from Johannesburg in the middle of the night  exhausted but excited  On arrival you notice that you drive past gorgeous resorts and into a construction district  which is a bit concerning  Once you go through the doors into the reception area you know that you have made a good choice  The Hilton is beautiful  Our emotional beginning was not over  We were suddleny told that our room wasnt available as the hotel was over booked  This was unnacceptable from an international chain such as the Hilton  But what could we do  Teary and disillusioned  we were sent to the sister Hilton in the Creek  They were welcoming and professional and the room was stunning  very high tech  I would have stayed there if the hotel had been on the beach  Reluctantly we went back to the Hilton Jumeirah beach the next day  and it took the staff a very short while to completely turn our experience around  We received nothing but professional and warm service  The food was excellent value for money and my   year old son was welcomed and entertained  The rooms are spacious  we were in an executive room  and the little touches were memorable  sun block on sunny days for eg   the restaurant staff were amazing  and the location perfect Yes there is construction around you  but it is more exciting and awe inspiring than anything else Even after visiting the top   star resorts  I would stay at the Hilton Jumeirah again because they really do try hard  We left Dubai knowing that we had to return and feeling like we were saying goodbye to family    days is really NOT long enough  I truly recommend this hotel for any well seasoned traveller  business or family traveller Enjoy  
P =>  Good base for a few days We spent   days at this hotel having been a regular visitor to the UAE for over    years  Yes  there is considerable building work going on around the hotel  but here is in every part of Dubai and vsistors should be aware of this  The hotel rooms were well appointed and the hotel provided an excellent base for our shopping trip which was the purpous of our visit  offering a regular courtesy shuttle bus to the various malls and the gold souk We were surprised at the service around the pool area which was much higher than expected for this class of hotel as they regularly came round with cold towels to wipe your face or with spritzer for the face to cool you down  a service you normally find in better hotels than this Be under no illusions  Dubai is a building site  but if like us you just want a good base for a few days then i can recommend this hotel 
P =>  Loved it stay for   days          lovely hotel super staff  Khan and all the boys at the beach are great  building going on is not a problem  will be back soon 
P =>  For Dubai   Good value for Money We went there with two adults and two child in a two room suite  The rooms were very nice with a sofs bed in the one room  for the kids  and a king size bed in the other  The suite is roomy  even for   with a very large bathroom   with seperate shower and bathtub  It has a small area with a mini bar and glasses etc away form the main room area  The beds and especially the pillows are extremely nice  The room comes with two balconys and overlooked the sea  not all do   Along with the suite you get access to the club lounge  which has snacks tea at  pm and drinks snacks at       This is one of the nice features and means that if you eat a late breakfast  you can pretty much survive until afternoon tea and not have to pay the high prices for food The restaurants serve nice  but generally expensive food  what you would expest foroa Dubai  star hotel   The drinks are also very expensive   as you would expect  The pool area and sunbathing areas are extensive and the beach is hige and clean with plenty of beach chairs  and very attendant waiters to get you drinks  We went in late  and sitting on the edge of the sea drinking beer  was the thing to do  The conscrution is not that big a deal really  They are generally doing the insides now  rather that concstructing outside  but it is quite a sight  So overall great for family  a bit far out if you like to change restaurants and party every night  
P => High standard Very nicely set up hotel with lots of attention to detail  Room was excellent  Outdoor pool  beach area was excellent  The only temporary downside is that is in the middle of a major construction zone  
P =>  Loved the Hotel  Stayed in the hotel for two weeks  found this website very very helpfull in booking my holiday  if you book a holiday in Dubai you should be prepared for the construction work as it is so close to this hotel but it is so quiet you dont hear a thing  We booked a seaview room but on arriving it was     Construction View and     sea view  so we complained and they moved us not a problem at all  The rooms are of average size fine they are immaculately kept with the staff cleaning them everyday  The staff in the whole hotel were lovely  they would not do enough for you  you tended to feel a bit sorry for them working away in the heat  Would not go to Dubai again during our summer months as the heat is just crazy i love the sun myself but not that much Would i recommend this hotel again yes I would I really liked it  
P => Superb Customer Care at Hilton Jumeirah Stayed for   nights during half term       holiday with the family  I was offered an upgrade to the  th Floor executive family suite    slippers  bathrobe  newspaper  bottled water and the works    the minibar was tempting  but I was well prepared with Glenmorangie from LHR duty free     yum Since it was my wife s b day the previous week  the hotel guest relations team came up with a delicious chocolate cake and a birthday card     its the small touches that make the difference The lobby and bar staff are very attentive and curteous     especially Miracar  who works at the lobby bar The breakfast was a treat in itself  with an excellent variety of fruits and other brfeakfast goodies The only small problem was the choices for vegetarians Indian meals at the restaurants  although on one of the nights in the Oceana restaurant  the chef did go out of his way to make us some  quot Mixed veg Masala quot  Keep up the good work      the construction work did not bother us at all    
P => Fabulous Service My husband and I stayed   days on the way home to Australia from Paris  We were given an upgrade to an Executive room on arrival so needless to say our stay got off on the right foot The room was large   especially after the size of French hotel rooms   It had all the amenities one could ask for  CD player  slippers  robes  coffee making facilities   free bottled water   turn down service etc  iron and ironing board  plenty of wardrobe space  huge bathroom  The beds were incredibly comfortable  after a long flight and my husband not feeling well  it was like slipping into a cloud  Heaven The service here was fantastic  from the breakfast service  housekeeping and pool beach area  The pool people were wonderful  always making sure everyone was comfortable  retrieving beach lilos  moving then to wherever you wanted and of course the waiting service for drinks etc was hard to beat The beach itself is used only by guests or locals willing to pay for the privilidge  It was clean and manned by lifegaurds  The building going on around the hotel was the only negative  and there is lots  While the noise of it didn t bother us as the glass is double glazed I gather  but it does look ugly  When checking in  ask if you can have a room on the side of the hotel facing the Burj Al Arab as this side is not as confronting in terms of the works going on  I will say though that at the moment Dubai is one huge building site so if you want a beach resort holiday rather than a stopover go to Thailand  
P => Beware of the building works I am writing this review to highlight some of the positive and negative points about the hotel  In my experience the Hilton Group of hotels have very high standards and that is why we stay with them so frequently  The hotel rooms were clean and the staff were excellent  The BICE restaurant was good and the exclusive   th floor bar which is only open to hotel guests was very relaxing and opulent  The Sports bar on the ground floor was very undersold and excellent value for money if you want a burger or some basic food  The other restaurants were what you would expect from a five star hotel  The waiting staff were quite keen to sell you more than you had decided to buy and were a little too keen to fill your wine glass   too intrusive but manageable  The pool was always very busy and the beach less so but nothing out of the ordinary  The gym was fine and very quiet  We were told that there was going to be building work going on but were informed by a member staff on our arrival that it finised at  pm each day  We subsequently discovered that it went on    hours a day  The hotel is right next to a huge concrete making facility and the main noise came from the warning beeping sound of construction vehicles reversing  It was a nightmare and drove us and other guests mad  I complained on the first day as it quite clearly stated that the building works had little affect on guests as the rooms faced inwards  This was plainly misleading  We were moved to the other side of the hotel  which was marginally better  So  if you go there this year I suggest you always ask for a room overlooking the pool and don t take no for an answer Since we are quite seasoned travellers we like to book an Executive room when we stay at the Hilton Group of hotels  The primary reason for this is that there is some kind of exclusivity attached with it as you usually get a room on the top floor which is generally known as the Executive Floor  The advantages of this are meant to be that you have a higher grade room  with internet fax for the business traveller  and an executive lounge which serves breakfast  afternoon tea and complementary drinks and finger food in the evening  When we have stayed in other Hilton hotels we have really enjoyed this personal service  Not in Dubai  The Executive floor was completely oversold  The Executive Floor is based on the top floor but people attending breakfast seemed to come from the  th floor upwards  This put a great deal of pressure on the Filipino staff  who were excellent  but totally unappreciated by their ex pat managers who were rarely seen  and when they were just seemed to tell their workers off with no appreciation of their predicament   They also tried to enforce a dress code on customers at pre dinner drinks   pm to  pm  which really wound up the customers  not because they did not want to comply but because they were unaware of the rules as they were not published  It was very embarrassing for the staff  and customers alike  Often it was the straw that broke the camels back and guests were extremely angry  Again a good manager would have dealt with the issues Would I stay there again  Not until the building work is complete  
P =>  Great hotel Fantastic staff Just returned from a   night stay at the Hilton with my wife and    yr  old son and had what can only say that it was perfect Having stayed in similar hotels throughout Europe and America this was our first trip to the middle east The staff of whom there seemed to be a lot were never more than a few feet away but never in your face The facilities at the hotel were such that we never had to eat out We stayed on the  th  floor executive and a few extra luxuries as standard While there is building work going on around the hotel this the norm in Dubai but it was never a problem We shall certainly be returning to this hotel  
P =>  Nice Beach   pool area My wife and I used points and upon checking in were given what must have been the absolute worst room location    st floor  smoking room  the room smelled like an ashtray  overlooking the ground floor construction site across the road  I know that this was a free room  but I m a gold member with non smoking King in my profile  We went back and were told that the only other room available was on the  th floor   same location  but with twin beds  We took it   at least it wasn t a smoker s room  There is a lot of construction going on all around the hotel   the staff are very helpful and the beach is nice  but the location leaves something to be desired  You really feel the huge buildings going up around you  The water was lovely  but I was stung by jellyfish  not severe  but about the size of a closed fist  while swimming  
P =>  Hilton is Great  Myself  husband  and son of    have just returned from the Hilton  We cannot praise the hotel enough everywhere was spotlessly clean  the staff could not do enough for you  the facilities are great  right on the beautiful beach  with lovely pool area and gardens and the Italian Restaurant Bice is wonderful  Even though you are surrounded by building work it really didn t affect our holiday at all  Good location for all the sights along with the fabulous shopping malls  We shall definitely go back again to the Hilton  
P =>   What a great time  This has been the stay of our lifetime so far  I ve come for a conference and tok my wife and the baby with me  This was the most amazing hotel I ve stayed in ever  There simply was no no  Whetever you needed you got  Amazingly attentive and very  very welcoming  I will certainly go there again next spring The surrounding is loud and it looks quite strange  but it does not matter  because it is more interesting then anything else and you know what to expect before you go The only downside  which is not the hotels fault  is that the water sports are truely overprized  The Jumeirah Beach hotel has the same stuff about        cheaper    That is not cool  But I am a watersports freak and others might not even care  Also  when you lay at the beach and the beach butler comes every noe so often and offers you cold drinks  who wants to go to the water anyway     Go there and enjoy  
P =>  Great Time Hi  Spend two weeks at the Hilton     and had a fantastic time  Sure the building work does take your breath away  but the majority of the heavy stuff has been done and the rooms are double glazed  I actually found it quite fascinating to watch  However the rear of the hotel could still be noisy I would imagine  All the staff were excellent and the food very good  Having a  yr old  the hotel was fantastic with the outside play areas under cover and a excellent free cr che  being under    we had to stay and watch   On the negative side the cost of eating at the hotel can build up  A suggestion would be to take the excellent hotel bus s to go to the two nearby malls and eat there for a fraction of the price  Also there is a    dhr per night surcharge which again can build up  I am curious what the area will be like on completion  but it looks like it will be fantastic  Taxi to the airport was about   dhr  with a mall ride costing about   dhr  Discussing with the bank manager  my wife  a return visit  Any questions feel free to email me  
P =>  Great Service   shame about the    hour building work nearby We have just returned from staying here for half term hols  We cannot recommend the staff  food and service highly enough and we are pretty picky about hotels  We had a great spacious   roomed suite for us and the two kids with a sea facing sitting room which became their bedroom  Unfortunatley our bedroom faced the major building projects over the road which are going on    x   This is the first time i have had to wear earplugs to try and get some sleep  kindly provided by the hotel when we asked   We do feel for the staff  they are doing all they can to make you have a great stay and the government are not helping by letting the builders operate round the clock  Apart from this though we had a great time and will go back but probably to a different hotel until the building work is finished  Kids made very welcome  the pool is heated just in case the temp drops a little   and there is a great kids club in case they get bored doing other stuff 
P => Great hotel excellent service I stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah on uary   th for   days with   friends  we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  Excellent service  We had   rooms that overlooked the pool area although the other side of the hotel partly overlooked the building site but you have sea view from both sides  The building works did not bother us at all The hotel is very clean  amp  the staff were so friendly  they cant do enough for you We ate at the Bice restaurant twice  the food was great  the entertainment  the piano player  was good  Our highlight was Friday brunch buffet at the Burj Al Arab which was about     without drinks  the food and the view was amazing  We booked on their website before we went to Dubai Everything about Dubai was excellent and would definetely stay at the Hilton again  
P =>   Absolutely Fantastic Hotel I was really apprehensive about staying at the Hilton due to the construction work I had heard so much about so I checked this site every day for new updates  As it turns out  we made the right decision to stay there  We stayed at the Hilton from        and found the hotel to be absolutely fantastic and first rate  The construction work is more fascinating to look at than cumbersome  I would urge anyone planning on staying there to get a seasideview if possible  but if not  it shouldn t really ruin your stay The staff are unbeleivably welcoming and friendly and we enjoyed every minute of our vacation  What I appreciated the most  unlike some other resorts we stayed at like in the Maldives  is that there isn t a general culture to suck as much money out of the guests as possible  They offer you complementary water in your room each morning and have a happy hour at the sports bar so you can get a few rounds of cheap drinks in before your evening meal  The Italian manager of the BICE restaurant even offered us a couple of after dinner drinks on the house after we chatted with him for a while  Everything is really made so you can enjoy your holiday  The fact that we got upgraded twice didn t hurt either The best aspect of this hotel is that although it is a five star hotel  as most of them are in Dubai   it is very accommodating to both couples and families and at no time do you feel out of place with kids  The staff actually genuinly love kids and it is not simply a prerequisite impossed by them on management  Don t be surprised if by the end of your stay everyone knows your kid s name  The beach has some swings and a bouncy castle which is great for the kids  The priceless benefit of this hotel is that it has a day care centre so you can either leave your kids there or get a baby sitter to watch them  We went with our    month old boy who absolutely loved running around in the sand in the morning and playing in the day care centre in the afternoon  He was so exhausted by the end of the day that he went straight to bed in the evening and we were free to eat by ourselves in the hotel  Unlike some earlier reviews  I found the pool water to be a nice temperature and not too cold  It wasn t overpopulated either  The beach is great and you have staff who are there at your beck and call ready to bring you drinks etc  if you want  You can do a host of water sports activities but they come at an additional cost  The Italian restaurant BICE was apparently voted the best restaurant in Dubai  The food was really good but there is naturally a price tag that comes along with that  The beach side restaurant  only really open for lunch  looked good but we never really got a chance to eat there  We ate lunch once at Almuntaha restaurant at the top of the Burj Al Arab  The food was ok but you have to be ready to walk out with a      bill for two at the end  The view is fantastic and it s a once in a lifetime opportunity so the choice is yours  If you are really looking for the great bargains in Dubai  go to the Karama market where you can buy anything from clothes  shoes  bootleg DVDs and fake watches  The shopping centres in Dubai are nice to stroll in but the prices don t differ that much from European prices unless there are sales on This is definitely a hotel I would return to in the future PS  all photos were taken early in the morning 
P => Fantastic We stayed at this hotel for eight nights and it was absolutely fantastic We were a bit apprehensive at the start what with the building works and the bad TV publicity   but it is the quietest building site we have ever seen  If anything it was actually pretty amazing to watch The hotel rooms  facilities  restaurants and staff are all amazing and nothing is too much bother for them As for Dubai itself   wonderful people  wonderful weather   what more could you want on your holidays If anyone has a bad word to say about this hotel then they are obviously very hard to please  Loved it from start to finish  
P => exellent hotel My first trip to Dubai Was apprehensive  but this fear was unfounded This place is absolutely fantatic for a short break It feels so very safe why can t we feel this way in England It was refreshing to walk around the bars and restaurants at night without encountering any Engish type of yob behaviour or drunks The taxis are plentiful and cheap with no ripping off The hotel was exellent especially all the Indan staff  
P =>  Oasis in a buiding site Our recent stay at the Hilton Jumeira Beach was not quite what we expected  The staff were great and worked hard to make our stay enjoyable  The rooms were large and well presented with great beds and nice linen We were aware that there was building work nearby but we were not prepared for the scale of it  From our balcony you could watch    multi storey buildings being erected  each in excess of    storeys  The work continued day and night  To take in the sea view you first had to blank out the village of workers huts just beside the hotel  the dust and noise made the balcony unuseable For a short trip we also found the Hilton just too far from the centre of things  a trip to the souks took       minutes each way and the roads around the hotel were in a very poor state due to the constant heavy traffic  
P =>  Great family friendly Hotel and Don t Worry about the building work   Just got back from a week with the family at the Jumeirah Hilton and was extremely impressed   Great room  family suite   Great breakfast  Fantastically friendly staff   Several really good restaurants  Italian and South American   Small but excellent kids club  Friendly and reliable baby sitters who are hotel employees  Good pool which is shaded for most of the day   Beautiful beach leading down to crystal clear warm     degrees  watersThinking about negatives   It is a long way from town          min in a taxi    When you look behind the hotel there is a mass of construction work going on  see my photo  but it is OK because they have finished all the heavy building work so you don t notice it unless you look behind and above the hotel  I would still avoid any room which faces inland though partial sea view rooms are fine At the hotel  UK half term holidays  many people were paying up to      for a standard room per night  This was after scouring the internet for bargains  I simply emailed them   months before  asking for the rate for the multi national company I work for and got a family suite    rooms  for      per night Overall I would recommend this hotel without a moments hesitation and the kids absolutely loved it   
P =>  Thoroughly recommended  Stayed for   nights earlier this year and would thoroughly recommend this hotel  We were welcomed with cold drinks and ushered straight away up to the Executive floor  where we were personally checked in and offered more refreshments  When we arrived in our room  we discovered that the extra bed ordered for our   year old was not there  but on enquiring  it was soon delivered   closely followed by a dish of  quot sweetmeats quot  and a card of apology from the manager Room was more than adequate  and big enough for all of us  The bathroom was well stocked  as was the minibar  There was plenty of hanging space in the wardrobes  Balcony   although it faced on to some of the building work   provided us with beautiful sea views  and a sunset not to be forgotten  The activity on the building site was actually quite mesmerising  we actually sat out with a coffee and watched for a while    but did not bother us at all once the doors were closed   or when we were on the beach or at the pool Executive lounge   go for it  This was the best value of our holiday  For our room rate we were able to have breakfast  hot and cold selections  eat as much as you want   afternoon tea if we wished and  best of all  a couple of hours of free drinks and  quot nibbles quot  in the evening   although  quot nibbles quot  is not how I would describe the selection of hot and cold food available  we only actually had dinner on one of the nights of our stay  since we had filled up so much at the  quot happy hour quot   and with alcohol being so expensive  the  quot free quot  drinks were a bonus   The beach was idyllic  and the pool never seemed too busy Finally seek out the Sky Bar  What a fantastic place for a nightcap  sitting under the stars  overlooking the Gulf  Fantastic memories  
P =>  Fabulous service and excellent value We stayed in this Hotel in tember and it was perfect for our requirements  Although we knew there was some building work in the vicinty nothing prepares you for the scale of this  In saying this we had a room that was facing the sea  as they all are  and we truly did not hear anything at all  It is too hot to sit for long on your balcony so it is not a concern to anyone who stays at this hotel  We paid an extra supplement to stay on the executive floor with access to the lounge and the complimentary refreshments during the day  it is well worth it  There is a separate entrance and the rooms are on higher floors  The beach and pool areas are well equipped and the service is perfect just enough but not too much  We ate only at the Bice restaurant within the hotel  but I can say this is a world class restaurant the service was faultless and the food was wonderful  Taxis are readily available but the road outside had so many speedbumps  this would only be my small complaint and this is not the fault of the Hilton Hotel at all  I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to visit Dubai but wanted to spend a little less than other hotels  
P =>  Fantastic We started our   week overseas trip with a   day break at the Hilton Jumeirah and were worried that we had peaked too soon  This hotel is fantastic  great food  pool  beach and the staff are amazing  Yes there is construction everywhere but not only at Jumeriah but all over Dubai  It was a full on round the clock construction zone outside our window and I did not hear a thing from our room and when you are at the pool or beach you are facing towards the water so it has no impact whatsoever  Breakfast is amazing  they have everything you could ever think of and try the Mexican restaurant it is lovely  Highly recommended  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Place  I have just returned with friends from a weeks stay at the Hilton Jumeirah and I have to say that the hotel and Dubai itself surpassed all my expectations  I read a lot of the reviews before I went so it was only fair to post one myself to help others who are travelling to dubai The hotel itself is excellent and will merit its   star status  The standard of service is excellent and the views are pretty good but would recommend a seaview room  There is visible construction at the front of the hotel and my guess is that it will be at least   months before the Jumeirah Beach Residence project is completed  The construction does not affect your holiday at all and you can hardly hear anything  You will probaly be able to see the construction from most of the seaview rooms because of the way the hotel is shaped but it really is not worth worrying about The breakfast is great and you can eat loads  The hotel also has some very nice restaurants  We had dinner at BICE and it is nice but a bit on the expensive side compared to other restaurants in Dubai  It is quite classy though so you would expect to pay more The pool and beach front have a really nice atmosphere  The hotel pool is cool but in Dubai weather you need a dip to just cool off  The weather is in the day was around    degrees but it is not so excessive that it becomes unbearable  When your wandering around Dubai you are just steppiing out of an air conditioned taxi into air conditioned malls etc so you hardly spend any time in excessive heat  I personally found the temperatures perfect and a nice tan is guaranteed There are better   star hotels on Jumeirah Beach  Mina Salam  Al Qasr  Royal Mirage etc  but these will be far more expensive  Some of these hotels are exremely picturesque and worth a visit  Getting about in Dubai is really easy and fairly cheap  The hotels run shuttle buses to the shopping malls and the souks  Alternatively you can just jump into a taxi and they are relatively cheap  The Hilton is quite far away from many of the souks and attractions so you will need taxis  A trip to the Burj Al Arab in a taxi for instance is around    Dirhams       The Gold Souks would probably cost around    DHS      in a taxi  Dubai is a lot bigger than I thought so its worth getting a map and plan your days so you can work in zones to avoid taxi fares back and forth  A practical tip is to avoid long trips in the rush hours as the traffic can be really bad  The longest amount of time we ever spent in taxi to get anywhere was about an hour As for shopping you are just spoilt for choice  In addition to the Gold Souks  there are a number of very smart shopping centres   Ibn Buttana  Mercato  Burjaman  Deira etc   I think the Emirates Mall is also very close to opening and it is supposed to be one of the biggest in the world  Most of the big hotels also have shops and restaurants There are loads of things you can do in Dubal if you don t fancy shopping all the time  We went to the Burj for afternoon tea and it is worth a visit  Wild Wadi is a fun day out  Madinat Jumeirah is worth a visit to see some of the great hotel grounds and bazaars etc   Nighlife is scattered across Dubai and most of the clubs are in hotel grounds   Fairmont  Emirates Towers  Madinat Jumeriah and others   If you don t like clubs  these places are still worth a visit as there are good shops and restarurants in the complexes and some of the bars will give you great views of Dubai  The Dubai skyline is just amazing particularly at night even with many buildings yet to be completed  Dubai is just fantastic and i would have loved to have stayed longer and I will definately be returning soon  Hope you find the review helpful  
P => Absolutely fantastic  Amazing hotel This ust  my Mother and I took a   week holiday to Dubai  a vastly up and coming city  definitely a jewel of the Middle East  We chose the Hilton Dubai Jumeirah from the brochure and after reading up on it from this site  felt compelled to tell everybody how absolutely wonderful this hotel  and indeed place  is  We left Heathrow on ust   th  arriving around  am on the morning of Friday   th  The transfer to the hotel from the airport was perfectly smooth  Driving in to the area though  down the Jumeirah Beach Road  at first looked like we were entering Beirut  The construction of the Jumeirah Beach Residence  and the Dubai ina  just behind  is on an absolutely huge scale  You just cannot believe the amount of buildings  and also cranes that there are  and my mother and I looked at eachother with a lot of apprehension  mainly both thinking  Oh what the hell are we in for   After passing by the Ritz Carlton and Oasis Beach  we pulled in to the Hilton and we were greeted by the huge grins and friendliness of the doormen who took our luggage for us  We knew before we left that hotel rooms were not ready for check in usually  until  pm  The friendly concierge did her very best to arrange something earlier  In the meantime  we took a short walk to see where the beach was  and free tea  coffee and water were provided as a type of  waiting area  in the StudioOne sports bar  Around   am  we were told that a room was available  and would we like to have a look at it before accepting it  It looked fine and we went back down to the reception to be issued with room cards and shortly after we arrived in our room  the concierge brought up our luggage and passports  The deluxe seaview room did live up to expecdtations  Very spacious and comfortable  with a nice bathroom and fair size balcony  From our balcony  to the right we had a charming view of the building works  but we were both taken back in surprise by just how QUIET it was  in comparison to the scale of the project  Not the most spectacular view  but you only had to look in front of you and to the left we could sea the beautiful white beach  crystal blue Arabian Gulf  the swimming pool and further out  we could sea the Palm Island Project coming to shape  Directly in front of us  albeit in the distance  we could see the Burj Al Arab  the only    hotel in the world  We were very impressed  Once the balcony door was closed  you could not hear a thing   and I mean a thing  The cool air conditioning kept the room at a nice temperature  and stepping back in to it at the end of a long hard days sunbathing in temperatures which peaked   C    F  was majestic The rooms were well cleaned everyday  with fresh towels and bathroom amenities  The bed linen was changed every three days  but could be changed every day if you wished so  There was a minibar  with alcohol and soft drinks at reasonable prices which was restocked every day  and you were also given   complimentary bottles of mineral water a day  There were also two spacious wardrobes and a good iron and hairdryer  hidden in a drawer  The beach of the hotel is stunning  Temperatures averaged around   C    F  and the sea water around   C   F  Never have I been in water  sea water  so warm  in fact you didn t get in to cool down  you got in to get wet and nothing more  The colours of the Arabian Gulf   a haze of technicolour blues and sandy bottom make the water ideal  The building work didn t bother us one tiny bit at all during our stay  we could barely hear a thing on the beach  I suppose it d be comparable to a small airconditioning unit a few metres away  And that is more drowned out by the sounds of the waves crashing on the white sand  There are very comfy seats which you can use which are at the edge of the water and are a perfect place to have the water lapping at your toes whilst catching some rays  There is a beach butler service  who drive around on a little cart to deliver any drinks you may order  When getting your pool towels  you are given a red flag which you hang up if you want to order anything from the butler  There is also a bar which you can walk up to yourself and purchase a range of soft drinks or beer  They also bring round huge trays of fresh juicy watermelon  ice cold flannels  heavenly   and cups of ice  even more heavenly   for nothing which are fantastic  Even in such hot weather  the staff could not be more friendly and considerate  and they are very genuine in doing anything they can to help There is a fairly large pool  with swim up pool bar  and also lots of subeds throughout the gardens  but we found the pool too busy and with a lot of children  and the beach was so beautiful  we infact only used the pool for half an hour on the first and last morning There are a range of restaurants in the hotel  We had bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast buffet in the Oceana Restaurant in the lobby had the most fantastic range of food anyone could wish for  There are every kind of fresh fruit  cheeses and cold meats  tons of different breads  croissants and pastrys  fresh cooked  full English  foods  as well as a cooking station where they could cook french toast  waffles  pancakes  any types of egg as you ordered them  They had a machine squeezing fresh oranges for juice which I wanted to bring home  It was my   th birthday whiilst we were there  and on the morning of my birthday  at my Mums request for some balloons at my table  all of the staff came out singing  Happy Birthday   with a birthday cake and candles  and some balloons  I was a bit embarrassed at first but it made it a very special morning and everyone in the restaurant said Happy Birthday to me  Oceana have  theme  nights  with a buffet menu of different styles  including Mexican  Italian  Seafood  Steak amp Jazz  and Arabic  We dined in here on the Italian night where the pasta is cooked in front of you to your taste and there are gorgeous fresh salads and meats  We also dined here on the Steak and Jazz night  where they had beautiful fresh cuts of beef  my Mum said the filet mignon was one of the best she d tasted   and the most fantastic desserts  including a chocolate fountain and marshmallows  apple pie  and my favourite of all  from the Italian night  Orange Panna Cotta  which was actually to die for  We dined in the upmarket  trendy and sophisticated Italian restaurant BiCE  The pasta is the best I have ever tasted  with a perfect Arabbiatta sauce  We also had food in WaveBreaker  off the beach  which was nice  and you could order anything you wanted  all day every day from Room Service  but  saving the best til last  the Latin American speciality  Pachanga  This restaurant was fabulous   We dined in here three times  and each time enjoyed it tremendously  You can choose from Brazilian  Argentinian  or Mexican fare  and the ambience is lovely  with salsa dancers on Wednesdays  but a live Latin American band performing music of that region on other nights  Whilst waiting for your food  you are served a complimentary basket of olive bread  still warm  which you could eat instead of dinner  and then hand coooked Nachos with a fresh guacamole dip  which is tailor made for you at your table  enabling you to see and choose exactly what goes in it  I highly reccoment the Chicken Fajitas  and just wait until you see how the desserts are presented   their appearance on the plate deserves a Michelin star alone in my opinion  In addition  the hotel run a shuttle to three main shopping places   First stop BurJuman mall  which is full of designer shops such as Dior  Chanel  Versace  Louis Vuitton and Saks  th Avenue dept  store  Second stop  Gold Souks  which are about a ten minute walk from where the bus drops you  although we did get lost and have to ask someone the direction to the Souk itself     good for jewellry  only white and yellow gold though  no silver  The shop owners keep cutting the prices  so if you really want something then go from shopto shop and get the best price you can  Last stop  Deira City Centre  a Carrefours hypermarket  BHS  Woolworths  and a Debenhams  Topshop and River Island  as well as lots of other stores and restaurants  It s a bit of a home from home  but still pretty good in a huge mall  The staff in the hotel are incredibly friendly  Incredibly  They are polite and nothing is too much trouble for anybody  I have to particularly mention Nasir  who works in the Lobby in charge of transport  He greeted us on our very first morning  telling us about the hotel and offered help should we ever need it  Every time we saw him  we had a charming conversation  and after I mentioned my birthday  he found me the day after down on the beach and gave me a small birthday book  which I thought was the sweetest thing for him to do  Totally beyond what the job requires I m sure  but he was incredibly friendly and made our stay that bit more enjoyable  Next  was Savio  who worked in the Lobby and also for Room Service   such a charming young man  evr friendly and couldn t have done more to help  Also Ly  who worked in WaveBreaker   to name but a few  The Hilton should be incredibly proud of these staff who make the hotel all the more worthy of its    status  All in all  we had a fantastic stay at the Hilton  We d love to visit there again in a few years and see the building work completed  There was nothing to do in the evening apart from dinner  no live entertainment in the hotel  only one poor point   and nowhere to walk to outside  In a few years the JBR and many other projects will be finished and I think Dubai will be even more a fantastic place to visit  I would definitely reccomend the Hilton Jumeirah   a top class hotel and I cannot praise them highly enough for the top quality service  beach and overall genuine friendliness they provided us with during our stay  
P =>  Fantastic doesn t even come close  My boyfriend and I have just spent    fabulous nights in the amazing city which is Dubai and our hotel of choice was the Hilton Jumeirah  Before our trip I had spent hours and hours trawling the net for reviews on the hotel  its location  service etc and although   out of every    reviews were positive  I can honestly say that none prepared me for just how amazing my stay there really was  From the second our transfer coach dropped us off at the Hilton Jumeirah  at     am in the morning   we were treated like kings  From the doormen that took our luggage and held open the car doors to the concierge who checked us in  There is not a negative thing I can say about the running of this hotel or indeed  its staff  As we had such an early arrival we could not engage our room until  pm so this meant a long wait  We were fully aware of this and could have paid extra for early check in but chose not to  Yes we were tired after the flight and yes it was hot  try    C    F     but there was the option of using the already thriving pool area  the beautiful air conditioned indoor waiting areas or the cushioned  shaded areas around the pool  And with the amazing bar and pool staff at hand to serve you ice cold water and flannels  the waiting around didn t once feel like an issue  As it turned out we didn t have to wait until  pm as our concierge did his utmost help to get us in as quickly as possible  We got the keycard to our deluxe seaview room at just after      pm  I will hazard a guess that most of the readers of this who are planning on or indeed are staying in the Hilton Jumeirah are aware and in no doubt concerned about the construction work that is going on around the hotel  I too  hence my hours of internet review trawling  had concerns prior to staying here  All I can say to anyone with worries is PLEASE DON T  I know it sounds crazy and I know it is said before in previous reviews  but it really isn  t an issue  Yes the construction is on going and for the best part of the day  yes you can see building works from most of the rooms in the hotel  yes there is some noise  I can honestly say  hand on heart when I was sunbathing and swimming in the pool I was barely aware of anything  The noise from the pool and families drowned out any construction  The beautiful surroundings of the hotel grounds more than made up for the unfinished buildings and apartments  And as for being in the room  You could NOT hear a thing  The pool area is brilliant with free sunbeds and free use of beach and pool towels   no need to bring one from home  The beach is amazing and the sea   wow  Never have I been in sea with a temperature of    C    F  Getting back to the staff of the pool and beach area   what a great job these guys do  So friendly and welcoming even in this extreme heat never do they show irritability or stress  Service with a smile at all times and you know what  They mean it  Fantastic people and I have to give a very special mention to Ly    The Hilton Jumeirah has wonderful restaurants and food  We had opted for bed and breakfast during our stay which was from  am   am  What a choice  The variety was amazing  Choose from an array of fresh fruits  cakes  pastries  bacon  hash browns  sausages  cheeses  cereals  toast  pancakes  waffles  eggs how you like them  From Continental to American  Japenese  Asian and a full English  the choice was there  We ate in two of the in house restaurants during our stay also  One was an exquisite Italian called Bice  the other  and my personal favourite  the Latino called Pachanga  Bice was great  The portions are huge  piping hot and the freshest tasting pasta I have had in a long time  Aperitifs are served whilst you have a drink at the bar and the ambience is great  Whilst we were dining Roger Federer was two tables away  And Pachanga   well  No exaggeration when I say it was the best steak I have ever tasted  Choose from either Mexican  Argentinian or Brazilian cuisine   why not have one of everything  Handcooked nachos with freshly made to order guacamole prepared in front of you are served whilst your starter and main meal is being prepared at no extra cost and the rustic bread is replaced frequently  This is definitely one to visit  Judging by the length of this review it appears that I have spoken enough about my praise for this hotel and so to save you all from falling asleep I will finish up now on these last few things  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with huge beds and lots of wardrobe space  the bathroom is modern and clean and the amenities are great  They are replaced everyday so you wouldn t even need to bring shampoo  conditioner  shower gel from home  The rooms are cleaned every single day and what a job they do  Robes are provided as are towels and complimentary mineral water is left every day  The health spa is worth a visit  I had a full body massage and it was fab  Yes ust is an extremely hot time of year in Dubai but not unbearable so don t let people put you off  I myself along with my boyfriend will      be visiting this amazing city and hotel again that I can swear to  
P =>  What more could you ask for    i went to dubai with my family last year for a week and stayed at the most luxrious hotel ever the hilton  the service is brilliant and the location is fabulous with the sea on you re doorstep   the hotel was everything you would expect and more the food delicious  rooms spacious with spectacular views   also from our hotel we organised an action packed day out including fishing water sports sand surfing camel rides and the must do if going to dubai the  x  dune tour fast and furious as you want overall one of the most memborable holidays ive ever experienced  
P =>   Superb hotel Have to agree with recent reviews of this hotel   it is excellent  in spite of the building site which surrounds it  I was disappointed to see such a damning review on TV the other night which concentrated solely on the building work and gave no credit to the excellence of the hotel itself  The staff are the friendliest and among the most efficient I have come across in many years of travelling  My young son loved it because everyone said hello and by the end of the week knew his name and made a point of speaking to him  Definitely ask for a sea view room  but the double glazing cuts out all noise and dust  and the pool and the beach are lovely  Just be prepared for the drive past the construction work and be amazed  
P =>  Loved Hilton Dubai Jumeirah I have stayed in many hotels but this hotel sticks out from the rest  It was simply exceptional apart from the construction  which you cannot fault the hotel it happens everywhere  The staff from day one were so friendly always treated us with smiles and always greeted us  The ammenties were exceptional with the pool which was always clean and the whole hotel was clean throughout  The food was exceptional and the price was reasonable  The staff were always ready to help you  I would recomend this hotel to anyone 
P =>  the best  after reading all the reviews and things before we went about the construction and things we knew what to expect  yes there is construction but you seriously just forget about it  it didnt bother us at all  but saying that if i was on my honeymoon or something then maybe dubai is an amazing placeand the hotel had the most amazing service ever  i have never felt so priveldged and i am so glad that even when talking with the staff the geniuinly want to be off assistance and it isnt false smiles the beach is beautiful and the cocktails in the hotel we nice to  having just got back yesterday it has been hard to try stay focused on anything other then planning my next trip   the hilton is a nice hotel and trust me you holiday will be just as amazing as ours 
P => Great Hotel Having just returned from this hotel  I must say yes there are loads of building works surrounding it  but the friendliness and service from the staff outweighs any of the disturbance the look of the building sites may cause  The staff can t do enough for you  they even brought round ice cold flannels and water sprays to help cool you whilst sitting by the pool and on the beach  The hotel is beach facing and the building works do not effect that view  It certainly did not spoil our enjoyment  The food is excellent  and breakfast a must  I have been to this hotel once before   years ago and there where no building works then  but I must say I enjoyed myself as much again this year  There are far newer hotels on Juremiah Beach  but the Hilton is just as good  if not as modern  Sitting on the balcony was very noisy  but the weather was really too hot to enjoy doing that anyway  it was easier to sit by the pool or on the beach in the shade of an umbrella  There are only about three hotels on the beach that are unaffected by the building works anyway  The whole of Dubai is engulfed in building of some description  Allow plenty of time to get to where you are going  as the roadworks being built to link Palm Island to the beach roads are causing chaos  
P =>  absolutely fabulous stay at the jumeirah hilton We have just returned from a  day stay at the Hilton Jumeirah Hotel  We can honestly say the hotel was everything you would expect from a  star  The staff were very courteous and friendly and couldn t do enough for you  Yes there is a great deal of constrution work going on at the moment but this isn t the only hotel afffected  It is throughout Dubai itself and you don t really notice it when you re in the hotel premises The beach area is very lovely with plenty of beds  The rooms are a good size with bathrobes and tea and coffee facilities provided If however you are visiting during the building work we would reccommend you ask for a pool veiw  We would definately book this hotel again  
P =>   Disappointing hotel Stayed there for few days and I have to say that this hotel for the price offers not much  The beach is nice but that is all  Staffs are careless and unfriendly  
P =>  Good hotel excellent service but spoilt by building work I stayed at the Hilton for   nights before moving to the Jumeirah Beach hotel  I was aware of the building work near the hotel  but thought it was further away than it actually is  The hotel is in fact in the middle of a building site and I found it did spoil it the stay a little  Being a Diamond HH member I was disappointed not to be offered an upgraded room  The room I was originally going to be put in was direly looking over the building site  I was then offered a room with a side sea view side building site view and next to the cr che   again not an executive room  The room was nice enough but not luxurious  on par with most other Hiltons  You could not really sit and relax on the balcony as the noise from the work was quite loud  The food was good and there is a good choice for breakfast in the executive lounge  The staff were excellent and couldn t do enough to help  There is a free shuttle bus to major shopping centres and the souks which was useful  The beach and hotel grounds are nice with plenty of loungers  however it was a bit cramped and I counted at least    buildings being constructed either side of the hotel while on the beach  After moving to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel  I would not rush back to the Hilton  even after the building work is finished as there are nicer hotels in the vicinity  
P =>  Great hotel pity about the building work  We stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah and found the hotel to be first class  We were upgraded to a suite which was very spacious and comfortable The building work was much more extensive than we anticipated but we were not really disturbed by it  It was fascinating watching the shifts change and the volume of workers coming and going The hotel itself was great and the staff could not have been more helpful Breakfast was fantastic and the afternoon tea in the executive lounge was a treat  The restaurants were all very good and the barbeque at the Wavebreaker was superb The beach is well kept with nice sun loungers and umbrellas  The beach butler comes round with cold drinks so you don t have to move from your lounger Although the hotel is a bit further out  there is a shuttle bus to the shopping centrs and the Gold Souk  Taxis are very cheap so distance is not a problem I would go back to the Hilton  it s not as new as some of the hotels but the service and staff are second to none 
P =>  Excellent Hilton Jumeirah Beach Hotel  Having used this site to help determine where we were going to stay  we thought its only fair we write a review ourselves  My friend and I stayed at the Hilton J hotel for four days from   th il       and we both found the stay fantastic  Firstly  the hotel staff are the best I have ever witnessed  they spoke excellent English  are courteous  friendly  helpful and genuinely nice people  Service was top quality  a booking error was changed in under a minute  booking excursions was fast and easy  bar staff were friendly and seem to offer lots of free games of pool and check in staff were brilliant  Most of the activities we carried out were organised through the hotel easily and quickly  The hotels main d cor is awesome and meets    quality  however  though our room was nice it wasn t incredibly luxurious  Nevertheless  free bottled water is offered throughout your stay  though at   p a litre from local shops this isn t such a bargain as it might seem  The complimentary breakfast had a good range of food  from fruit to hot stuff  Cleaning of the rooms and general appearance of the hotel was excellent too  as was its modest but well kept pool  not that it s needed with an incredible white sand beach  There are lots of beds on offer so no fighting is necessary to get one  yet they don t seem to hinder the look of the hotels impressive outdoor grass and bar areas  The gym was very good  including saunas and equipment Despite being next to    hour construction  most of the hotel overlooks a beach view  and considering all of Dubai is being built upon  this is not much different from any other hotel  and in fact we found at night the construction actually looked appealing  Taxis will be needed throughout your stay  though at very cheap prices and you will be able to get to most of the souks and sites in under    minutes  We would definitely go back given the chance  
P => Lovely hotel but not the best on Jumeirah Beach It is true to say that the overwhelming construction work which surrounds the Hilton complex is a bit of an eye sore  and my deluxe sea view room  was a massive disappointment  but the service here is fantastic  and the food of top quality  The hotel boasts several high quality restaurants with cusine ranging from Italian to Mexican  The Thursday night Arabian buffet is a must  Breakfast is also a real event in itself  and the skybar on the top floor is highly recommended for the view  Rooms are of a good size  and are comfortable but not luxurious  The pool and gardens leading to the beach are very pleasant  and you don t relly notice the construction work going on in the background after a while  We did enjoy our short stay but I doubt we would return  as I am certain there are better   star hotels on Jumeirah beach  albeit at a more expensive rate  
P =>  Couldn t be much better Having only booked this trip a week in advance having struggled to get a hotel anywhere on Jumeriah Beach  and having been warned about the extensive building work going on  we travelled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation  We needn t have worried This is a fantastic hotel which certainly merits its   star rating  The staff are fantastic and can t do enough  The food is excellent  breakfast is an event   the positioning slightly outside of the city is good  taxis are extremely cheap        for a    minute ride to the other end of the city  and there s no need to worry about the building work  Of course there s loads of work going on and there is some noise  but this doesn t affect your holiday one bit  The soundproofing in the rooms means you don t hear it and in fact it becomes a bit of a spectacle to watch the work going on  The beach is fantastic and the amenities in the hotel are very good  don t take beach towels they supply them   There s even a beach butler who will bring drinks  towels and food at the raise of a red flag also provided   We wouldn t hesitate to go back  in fact my wife said she d go back today if possible  We re not perfectionists but we do certainly like things to be just right  and without hassle  The Hilton certainly supplies this  I read the reviews before travelling and there does appear to be a mixture  Don t hesitate to select this hotel The BICE restaurant  Pachango and the   th storey bar are musts  
P =>  Surrounded by a building site Stayed here   nights     ch in an  quot executive quot  room If having breakfast or evening drinks overlooking a building site is your thing it is worth the extra money Hotel itself OK service excellent all staff appear to be from the far east  and food good However the equivalent of Canary Wharf is being built around it and we found it very depressing The grounds also feel very cramped  Personally  i would not stay here again even after the building works are finished  
P => A great weekend break  Just spent   days at the Hilton Jumeirah and hardly noticed the building works  Of course it s all around you but walking on the beach  sunbathing on the beach and taking a trip to the Creek  it was an adventure and together with excellent service  very comfortable beds  warm sea  clean beaches  we returned to the UK feeling refreshed  There were no children in the Executive lounge when we were there late  and I will return in a couple of years when the building is finished  
P => Bob the Builder The friendliness of the staff and the pretty good amenities at the hotel do not  unfortunately  make up for the incredible amount of building work in progress only yards from the room  The balconies on the rooms are unusable and really the biggest gripe is that the booking agent mentioned nothing about this disruption  We managed to secure a late checkout without being charged  UAD     mainly due to the good service of the front counter staff  One plus point however is the extremely good food to be found at both the Bice Italian restaurant and the Pachange   worth a detour for that alone  The hike into town particularly when the traffic is bad is irksome and even the bus takes over an hour on most journeys Having said this the staff at the hotel were excellent  friendly  efficient  good natured and an all round credit to the Hilton Group but my advice to anyone seeking a beach holiday   try somewhere else The service on the beach is good but some of the sun loungers could do with a makeover  
P =>  Disappointing hotel but still a great beach  You have to feel sorry for the Hilton Jumeirah  even after the monumental building work that s currently going on is finished  their hotel will never be the same again  It s about to be dwarfed by the Jumeirah Beach Residence that s being built seemingly all around the Hilton  It s difficult to predict how the opening of that complex will affect the previously quiet stretch of beach in the long term but already this hotel s setting has been changed for the worse by the building work  Our executive room had an uncompromising view of the building work and nothing else  rendering the balcony completely useless  This had NEVER been pointed out even slightly  when reserving the room  Bedroom and bathroom furnishings were simple and very much in the style of a standard     s hotel  Looking a little tired and nothing outstanding  the one exception were the beds which were large and very comfortable indeed  Another massive disappointment was the Executive Lounge  which could more accurately be called the Family Room due to the large numbers of children who were always present  The lounge was too small to accommodate the number of guests who choose an  executive room   It shared the same deeply depressing view of the building work as our room and was only cheered up by the relatively friendly staff who were doing their best  The breakfast choice was adequate and the food quality above average without being fantastic  The Afternoon tea was half hearted and we didn t bother trying the  Happy Hour   The name Executive Lounge implies a certain atmosphere and exclusivity  Eating breakfast surrounded by children  high chairs and far too many smokers isn t my idea of a hotel fulfilling that promise  Other Hilton Lounges are superb  this is nothing but a let down  Fortunately the pool  gardens and beach are first rate  The only problem being that the Pool is almost always in the shade  early   and the area around it is very susceptible to the sea breeze making it rather chilly  The small but pleasant beach club is tightly packed with loungers that were never full  It would be more sensible and give a more spacious feel to have fewer loungers out on the beach  Service of drinks and food at and around the beach and pool was fine  A walk along this stretch of beach is still a pleasure  the sea is warm and clear and the beach is soft white sand  Despite the other hotels nearby the beach never felt crowded as we strolled along it  I m afraid it s really hard to recommend the Hilton over other hotels in the area  where you ll find better service and facilities and you ll be further away from the building work  Without doubt you should fully investigate availability at other Jumeirah hotels before choosing this one  But there may be a bargain to be had if rates start to fall  
P =>  Great  Having been warned regarding significant construction work in immediate vicinity  we had some trepidation about what to expect  Despite the incredibile amount of building work  this in no way interfered with our stay at the hotel which we thoroughly enjoyed  The hotel is excellent and not as pretentious as some  quality of service could not be faulted and restaurants offered good choice at realistic prices  The only downside of the construction is the additional traffic problems it creates  We would most definitly return  
P =>  Better then the Sheraton or Oasis Beach The Hilton is not as business traveller orientated as the Sheraton and the decor is less tacky then the Oasis Beach  both of which are also on Jumeriah Beach  out of the   I have stayed in  this is the best so far Stayed at this hotel on   th  for   nights  As others have mentioned there is a lot of construction going on directly in front of the hotel entrance  but it does not affect your stay  The noise is minimal and you hardly notice it when you are by the pool or on the beach We arrived very early  well before check in time  but they provide an early arrivals service  where you can use the health club to get showered and changed  allowing you to have breakfast or lie by the pool until check in  and they will come and find you to tell you when the room is ready  which for me was   hours before official check in time  You can also continue to use the facilities if you have a late flight and need to check out The rooms are a good size and in excellent condition  containing everything you need  although the bathroom is not the biggest  Nice sea view from the balcony  excellent facilities  heated pool  great restaurants etc  and very friendly staff  They also have complimentary shuttle busses into the souks and city centre which will save you the taxi fare  which isn t much anyway  Would recommend this hotel  
P =>   Aufwiedersen Pet   Dubai   This was our third trip to Dubai and we knew exactly what we were letting ourselves in for when booking the Hilton Jumeirah Beach from the              Yes   the Hotel is in the middle of a building site  However  we purposely booked this Hotel as we have a vested interest in new property being built on Dubai ina   just around the corner from the Hotel  For us it was heaven and an ideal location  but we certainly would not recommend this location to you if you want peace and quiet  There are far better hotels like the Jumeirah Beach and Mina A Salam that offer a far higher level of service  stunning rooms  an excellent location without the building sites  dust and noise We had a family suite on the  th floor with two balconies  Both balconies overlooked the construction workers accommodation and the vast Jumeirah Beach Residence complex being built  This was on the non swimming pool side of the hotel  The noise is noticeable and it is       I found it fascinating   to see so many construction workers actually working day and night non stop  The building noise is also audible at poolside  The beach is the best place to avoid the noise if you want peace and quiet Having said that  the staff on the whole were very professional and friendly with a good standard of customer service  Only one blip   we waited over half an hour for drinks in the Axis Bar   So be warned   there are far better hotels in better locations that can be classed as true five stars  I m afraid to say that The Hilton is not of the same five star standard as the two hotels mentioned above  The photos from a previous review paints a true picture of whats going on around the Hotel at the moment  Expect this to last for the next      months as a minimum  
P =>  Excellent Hotel   Great Holiday Stayed at the Hilton Jumeirah  th feb       feb     executive king suite  Before giving a review of the hotel i will mention that the surrounding construction did not affect our holiday  The noise is minor  hardly noticeable and you can quite happily sit on your balcony without disturbance   The suite was spacious  very comfortable  with many hilton branded amenities  bath oils  shaving set  toothpaste set  shampoo  conditioner etc   Also contained cd player  expresso maker  kettle  iron  huge minibar fridge  safe and   balconies  If you can afford to then splash out on these executive suites    why  Well these are located on the high floors with an excellent view of the coast and burj  if pool facing   You also have access to the executive lounge for buffet breakfast  lunch afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks and snacks  plus extras such as complimentary clothing press   There is also a dedicated concierge to your needs located on the  th floor  Pool heated with nice bar for cocktails  One thing we found   the pool does not get much sun during the day   better off at the beach  Both pool and beach have waitered service for drinks and snacks  Towels provided one per guest each day for use at pool or private beach  Pachanga restaurant is a must  argentinian brazilian mexican food with live performances   BiCE restaurant also worth trying  Surrounding hotels are the Meridian beach resort  ritz carlton  oasis beach and sheraton  Taxis dirt cheap so venture out into the city without worry  Worth it   
P =>  Fantastic service great Hotel sad to leave Just arrived home from a fantastic trip to Dubai   After reading some of the reviews I did think of booking into a different Hotel however we try and stay with Hiltons wherever we go for the Hilton Honour points  I couldn t beleive my eyes at the sheer building work going on    hours a day around the Hotel but as some reviews have already stated you don t seem to notice it after a while  We stayed at one of their panoramic rooms I think that              are these suites  Room     we had two massive bathrooms with walk in showers that you could easily of fitted about   people in  the bath was a huge jacuzzi bath  we had our own kitchen  there were televisions in the massive lounge and bedroom  The views were breathtaking from the balconies and room     has three to choose  Fantastic dining table dresser etc  Cleaned to a very high standard  turn down service etc Swimming pool was great and there were plenty of lounges available all through the day   Exceutive lounge was nice and the breakfast served there was of a very high standard   Hotel restaurants are excellent and especially enjoyed the Italian Bice restaurant and Pachangas  Staff are really friendly and welcoming   It was a very special anniversary and Birthday holiday and the staff made us feel very special indeed  One important thing about staying in Dubai though is make sure that If you like alcohol that there are no public holidays planned because alcohol will not be served unless it is to the hotel room   
P =>  Nice but not   stars Excellent service and staff  However  rooms  single and double  only have bathtub showers  something I wouldn t expect at those rates  You can get a fast internet connection  faster than ISDN but slower than broadband   DSL  at your room at AED    per day or AED     per week  Simply plug the supplied LAN cable into your network socket  However  some ports are blocked via this connection  namely FTP and SMTP  While I was able to receive mail  I couldn t send it from my mail client  instead I had to resort to my webmailer  Bear in mind that with the current construction work        at Jumeirah Beach Residence going on the place can be very loud at times so sitting on the balcony isn t very relaxing at least for the time being  If you want a view of the palm from the hotel you ll need a room to the north  odd room numbers  The hotel offers complimentary shuttle buses to locations in Dubai every few hours  a nice service that saves on your taxi bills  ride to airport or Deira City Centre is AED         Some advice if you re plannning to buy into property in Dubai  especially with regard to villas and town houses  Make sure with the owner or real estate agent that you not only buy the house but also the ground it stands on

P => Dooobai nice hotel  central location  cool  good looking chicks in the disco and friendly ukrainians in teh coffee shop  shame there was no pool but there was always the sea  
P =>  It was not terribel but i dont think i will go again  This hotel is very controversial  location might appeal to a lot people due to the fact that it s located near many traditional attractions  like Spice souk etc  However  during peak time  Hotel s in and out is nearly impossible as it is located between two major streets that are connected with very very narrow ones  which are surrounding the hotel  Luckily  there is a metro station just     minutes walk away from the hotel  it might not be the perfect solution  as many stations throughout Dubai are still under construction  My friend was a smoker  so the room was really smelly and carpet was disgusting  but I believe if it was a non smoking room  it would have been much nicer  To my surprise  the mini bar was key locked and sealed with a plastic ring  and it will be only opened upon request  Bathroom  unlike the room  was roomy  clean and comfortably white  I hate colorful bathrooms   To be fair in my review  the service from the hotel staff was amazing  I remember that I have asked for many things including an adapter  Nokia charger  ice   and it was all provided quickly and with a big smile  To tap it up  smoking room  bad  Location  not recommended  service  Excellent  and it s not the standard i am used to from Holiday Inn  They must visit the hotel and check for themselves 
P =>  Not recommended This hotel is located in the old area of Dubai  Deira  near Riga street  The hotel is clean  but there are some issues   there is a night club in the  st floor  and it s too loud  so we couldn t sleep   the internet is not free  even in the lobby   only few parking available for guests  you have to come early to find good parking   the rooms are too small  
P =>  Ignore the above reviews We have just come back after four fantastic nights at this hotel  It is located in the heart of Deira  within walking distances of the creek  motor taxis  gold and spice souks and short taxi rides to both the Emirates and Deira malls  The staff were very friendly  the room spacious and spotlessly clean  the breakfasts varied and tasty and the pool well cleaned and maintained  There is a nightclub on the  st floor of the hotel but as we were located on the  th floor the noise didn t disturb us  All in all a super experience and I would not hesitate to go back and stay there  As for the review that said the hotel was dirty and dusty   you are in a city that is building a new underground system   there are building works going on everywhere   and YOU ARE IN A MIDDLE EAST ARID DESERT ENVIRONMENT   it WILL be dusty  
P =>  Practical Place for Business I trusted Priority Club  amp  booked here almost blindly  but was pleasantly surprised when the frontdesk upgraded me to the executive floor  Rooms were comfortable and well furnished  though smallish  Free Internet in the room and good speed  Breakfast next day was not opulent but practical but good selection of breads  meats   fruits and made to order eggs  Late evenings  if you re adventurous you can step in to  st floor where you have the  colorful  night clubs    activity is on till quite early in the morning  Haven t checked them out though Good part is that it s well located from reachability perspective and there is ample places nearby   if you want to eat out Lounge is small but practical for business meetings  Overall a very practical business hotel  
P =>   Do Not Stay Here Unless you want to stay near Deira  or the airport  and must stay in IHG property  Intercon Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn    DO NOT stay in this hotel  Its beyond me how they are able to sustain the Holiday Inn brand  Great Location  and good Front Desk staff  The ambiance and furnishing and smell and noise and environment is appalling  There is a very small pool on the rooftop  no views  and some   weird looking rooms that I can only assume are either run down bars or shisha corners  It seems to be open late so the noise of people walking up and down the stairs will keep you awake all night  specially if staying in the   Executive Floor    For some reason you are not able to leave your bags in storage  so if you  like me  are planning an overnight trip to Abu Dhabi or other UAE location  it becomes a huge inconvenience  I didn t understand the vibe of the hotel at first  but after reading a review in Trip Advisor of escorts offering their services in the hotel  it all falls into place   this hotel is a huge mess  Staff are polite but there is no attention to detail   asked for an internet code and was given it on a scrap paper which had other guets  information  address  Rm number and amount paid  on the back      I mean  how careless can it get  Yes  nice location    min from airport  but stay somewhere else  which cannot possibly be as bad  
P =>  NIce Brothel    if your in to that Stayed at this hotel on business with other collegues  Our first experinece of this type of hotel in Dubai  We have always stayed in hoilday inns or crowne plazas around the world but this was the first that supplied  Extras  if you know what i mean  During a business drink we were asked by a young lady if we wanted company  we declined thi offer but she stuck around until we left  we then found her there everynight pestering us during the stay  it got to a point we never went in there as we knew she would be there and found ourselves hidin from her  The indian disco is an experinece although you dont need to attend to hear the music  what ever floor you are on you will hear the music so if your using this hotel as a stop over to get sleep forget it as it goes on to  am  The food is not good and the pool is a death trap with broken tiles and pool surrounds  There are only   sun loungers that are extremly dirty   Dont believe the pictures on the web site   we paid approximetly      per night but even if the price was     i still would never stay  I emailed Hoilday Inn on my return and they offered       bonus points and said they would contact the hotel  but looking at otehr reviews it dosent look as though they have changed it  I carried on with my complaint and was eventullay given a total of        points as compensation  The sooner Hoilday Inn remove this hotel from the group the better its brand will grow espesially with class hotels such as Crowne Plaza sheik Zayed Rd  one of the best hotels ever stayed  and the opening of the new Crowne Plaza at Festival City  which is cheaper than this Brothel   Did i mention that thenight club was also filled with women selling thereselves  
P =>   never stay again in this bad   star hotel  I booked this hotel from the travel agency for the period of    till         for me and my friend for     DHS  We arrived hotel at       am and we waited for our room for    minutes because according to the receptionest our room is not ready yet and the room service needs to prepare and clean it  After we checked in at       am and we got to the room from the beginning the room was already renovates and new Firstly  the minibar  fridge  was not working at all because all drinks inside are hot also the cover of pillows were dirty and when i talked to the room service they say ok and they are going to change both pillows and fridge  we slept for  hours then we got back from the hotel after we remind them about these   issues after we got back after   hours we found nothing happened so I call them to come to my room maybe after    minutes they came and changed the pillows and they took a fridge with them at the beginning I thought that the technician will take the fridge to replace it with a new one but we waited for one hour then when I called them they said we do not have a fridge right now they will bring for us a new one tomorrow   I told him are you kidding  directly I requested to speak to the manager after many tries from the receptionest to know what s the problem  I talked to the manager and I think he is from Pakistan about these issues then he said that he promised that these things will not happen again  Also when we arrived the hotel the reception insisted to have our passprots  however what we had only ID cards there are an agreement among Gulf countries that the citizens can travel amongGulf countries by ID cards and no need for passports  like Europe by mistake I had a copy of my passport in my car but what about if I do not have    even the parking is very small and the most of it are not sun roofed  Finally I believe that the manager of the hotel does not know how to manage the hotel in appropriate way  Also the most of staff are friendly  
P =>  Worst I have ever seen I have seen a lot of hotels but nothing like this one   even if you decide to pay Dhs     for this hotel  trust me its way too much The room size is okay  but go a little further and check the walls  the carpet  you will find them stained  The furniture is dusty no matter how many times they come and clean it  simply because they dont clean it well The vicinity of the hotel is oh sooooooooo dirty   YUCKKKKK  Lots of bits of papers lying everywhere Ask the front desk staff for anything and they make a face like by giving you information they are doing a favor on you  Never a smile on their faces you can trace  This person Sohel   dont know if I spelled it right  always has a frown or a creasing on his face  Doesnt feel welcomed  An absoloute unprofessional behaviour The gym is okay but the pool is filthy  Also no lifeguards  Is nt the lifeguard s presence normal  especially in a hotel which has a Holiday Inn branding behind it   The check in does not take much time but I should say to get checked in  you definitely have to wait for nothing less than    to    mins Food is average but the preparations and the choices are the same everyday  Nothing changes right from the breakfast to lunch to dinner  If you are looking for pub and bar choices you will find plenty  but when it comes to retaurants uh uh   nope nope nope  Either you eat at the hotels one and only restaurant or go out  But come back late because you wont be able to sleep till atleast   am  What to do the pubs keep on banging music in your eardrums If this is not enough  The staff servicing the food and beverage areas do not tie their hair into buns but wear plaits or ponytails  And this is a    Hotel   Doesnt seems so  Its more fit to be a   star or lower than that This place it definitely not suitable for business travellers eventhough it is closer to the airport I would never come here ever again  There are a lot of hotels in Dubai  where a little more money would give me peace  
P =>   Stay Away The only reason why I booked this hotel is because it s a Holiday Inn  Bad decision  The hotel staff is not terribly friendly and it seems they were understaffed  The rooms are just ok  They are old and need renovating  There is an annoying night club on the first floor that plays loud music until  am  I was on the  th floor and could still hear it  I recommend staying on the opposite side of the hotel  I booked a non smoking king bed Executive room  It is a waste of money  There is nothing special except that you get a trouser press and iron ironing board  I tried the restaurant on the top floor and it was good  There are plenty of hotels in Dubai and I suggest looking elsewhere  
P =>   Would not recommend Although advertised as a   Star hotel  my guess that it is somewhere between a     star  I booked to stay for   nights but barely managed to stay for    hours  The hotel lobby was ridiculously small and smelled of tobacco  The property is understaffed and the staff at the Reception were ill mannered  I went for an executive suite but it was a joke  Other than its large size  there is nothing to speak off  The property is tastelessly furnished and poorly equipped  Would never recommend this property to any one  
P =>  Could be a lot better Arrived at  am to book for two nights and were given a room within an hour which was a help as we had just flown in from Bangkok and were tired  The reception staff were pleasant  The room was big  well furnished and clean   not much of an outlook though  However the servicing of the room was poor  First we had to ask for the tea making facilities  more towels and face cloths  The fridge obviously had not been cleaned for a while  The next day we went out at   am  and on our return at     pm  found the room had not been serviced so had to hang about the pool area for an hour while it was done with profuse apologies from the manager  Although the phone was working that day it was not the next day when we left so we had to struggle downstairs with our luggage  The method of getting you a taxi was for the concierge to stand outside and flag one down as it passed which you could do yourslf  Did not try the food as we thought   drms  expensive for a breakfast  Heard no noise from the club and saw no ladies of the night although at our age      we were in the room reasonable early  Having stayed a few weeks before at the Al Sharjah Holiday Inn  the two in Bangkok and one in Singapore on this trip we were disappointed with this one and did not consider it good value for the money  
P =>  Never Go Downtown     Trust Me I Swear      On   nd y i went to Holiday Inn Downtown after staying at Renaissance Hotel for a week   Obviously i had two days in Dubai left and had to chill but i couldnt  The Club known as  th Avenue is on a rented premises and they dont care whether you stay in the hotel or not they would charge    dhs entrance fee each day  Somehow i managed to get in thanks to some amazing bell boys in the Hotel but than i was harrassed that i had to drink something or i should get lost  The Bartender Owner was rude  can t a guy take a nice juice in a club  check out some chiks pick them up   well not in this one  Secondly when i thought that i had a bad night i called it a day and left the hotel within one day i was given a dead line for      pm and then i was told to keep the stuff in the lobby  Everywhere you would find an amazing    dhs deal for a perfect chicken or beef burger  thats what the posters say  But you will not get it as the deal is off  The Phone in my bathroom was broken  however the bed and the room was in good shape  The Reception on the TV was pathetic its better in alaska or Papua New Guinea  The Lady at the Reception was rude  Only the Reception guy who is of Egyptian Origin is friendly who comes at   pm shift  Bell Boys like Shakeel and Hotel Boys Like Hasif along with Basheer are friendly perhaps the seniors should learn  Even if you bring a girl over from any clubs you would be thouroughly asked whether your room allows a female or not   The Point is if someone is in Dubai and books this hotel  is it stated in the form that this room allows a female or not in a single standard room  You call this   star  Mind You the Tooth Brush and Tooth Paste are on Request in case you dont bring your own  
P =>  As good as any Holiday Inn anywhere I did not stay at this hotel but as I often stay at Holiday Inns when visiting the US and found them very acceptable  I was put off by the reviews  So when in Dubai I decided to drop in and check it out  This is a modern purpose built Hotel in a lively area of the Diera district of downtown Dubai  It is near the Airport  the Creek  Dowe Warf and the Soulks When I called I told them that I would like to see the rooms with the possibility that I might stay on a future trip  The doorman could not have been more welcoming and helpfull  The man on reception was pleasant and helpful  maybe not the friendliest we met in Dubai  but he had no hesitation in getting the doorman to show us around the hotel and some of the bedrooms The rooms are very good and very much up to Holiday Inn standards  clean  in good order and with all the facilities you would expect in a modern hotel  In a city where   star hotels abound you might feel you are not keeping up with the Jones s but for a resonably priced Hotel this   star place seems pretty OK to me  Reception is a lively place and a restaurant serves snacks and meals    hours a day  So if you are on a budget or just want somewhere nice to lay your head ib Dubai  stay here  If money is no object or you would like to spoil yourself  go somewhere else  
P => Got on great at the Holiday Inn I d booked the Holiday Inn Downtown and then read the reviews  ehensive was an understatement after reading the reviews The Holiday Inn was a pleasant experience  We arrived at the hotel at       in the morning to be warmly greeted by the hotel staff and shown to our room  If you ve stopped in a Holiday Inn before then what you ve previously experienced room wise is what you ll get  The rooms are spacious and clean with all the facilities you expect  The room was cleaned every day  As for noise  we were on the  th floor and didn t hear a thing The pool and the pool area is small but quiet  well it certainly was during my visit   There is a cafe up on the rooftop that provides snacks and drinks  Again very attentive friendly staff There was an extensive breakfast proivded from               The location of the hotel is great if you re looking to experience the heart of Dubai   the gold and spice souqs  shopping  nightlife  All areas are easily accessible by taxi  one point to mention  if you do require a taxi ask for a normal taxi as the hotel tends to put you in their very nice leather seated cars but these are double the fare   I can imagine that you could find yourself in the company of the people described in the other reviews at night but to be honest if you re looking for a hotel to act as a base while you explore Dubai then you can t go wrong  Go out of the hotel at night and within a short distance you ll find plenty to eat and see  If you re looking for a hotel that you don t want to leave book a   star like the Le Meridian or the Hilton  
P =>  Reception Staff Horrible Myself and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for   nights in uaryFirst off found the reception staff completely ignorant and unhelpful Rooms were dark and stuffy Don t go to the austrialian bar   its a kip and a rip off   Seedy clientele Don t waste your money    
P =>  Tatty and bordering on the rough If you don t mind staff who are rude and inefficient  a diry  tatty room  dark lobby and prostitutes arguing with clients late at night then you might be OK here The Holiday Inn Deira was a base for me and colleagues on a business trip   we moved elsewhere after two nights ROOM   sheets etc dirty and generally tatty LOCATION   not brilliant  Deira is home of the gold souk etc but it s easier to be based elsewhere and get a cheap taxi  It was HARD to find taxis here   presumably they frequent the smarter hotels STAFF   rude people on reception  They managed to cancel a colleague s room  so when he arrived off a plane at midnight he had nowhere to stay and ended up booking into the uber expensive Sheraton INTERNET   in room only dial up  not broadband GYM   tiny  one running machine  one bike  a few weights  BAR   no idea   didn t fancy it FOOD   breakfast buffet limited choice PROSTITUTES   always a few hanging about in the lobby in evenings    that s fine BUT when you re woken at  am by one violently arguing with a client about money outside your room       well   CONCLUSION  give it a miss unless you can get a really really cheap deal and have no standards

P =>   Oasis  We had never stayed at a Holiday Inn so had no point of reference or expectations but I would be very surprised if other Holiday Inns are any where near the high quality of Holiday Inn Dubai Al Barsha The location on Sheikh Zayed Rd  is very convenient   walking distance to the Mall of Emirates  containing Ski Dubai  which also now has a Metro stop   the Dubai Metro is brilliant  and will be more so when all the stations are open  and can take you to Dubai Airport for only a few dirhams  The heat is oppressive in Dubai so to the Mall is about the only place you ll be able to walk to  fortunately though taxis in Dubai are cheap  clean and plentiful so a trip to the Burj Al Arab or the Dubai Mall is very affordable  When we checked in there had been a mix up with our room and it took the manager a few moments to sort it out   thankfully he displayed total professionalism and upgraded us to a suite  Praise Allah   The suite was massive and in pristine condition  as was the whole hotel  This made our two night was an absolute pleasure  Every request was attended to quickly and without fuss  Tipping is appreciated but not expected in UAE so you don t feel as if you are being hustled by good service   this was extremely refreshing  We dined at the Burj Al Arab  which I highly recommend  so cannot give an account of the restaurants in the hotel but their decor was fabulous  Alas I didn t sneak a glimpse of the alleged prostitutes at that bar mentioned in other reviews so can t comment on whether everything in Dubai is indeed bigger and better in this regard  We were particularly impressed with the rooftop pool and bar area   superb views of the Burj Al Arab  A great way to spend an hour or two to get the tan to show the friends back home that you were in the Middle East  not just in air conditioned malls all the time Dubai is a fabulous place for a break   not at all as plastic and soulless as I thought it would be   I can t wait to return and look forward to staying at the Holiday Inn Dubai Al Barsha again   
P =>   Great value Having read previous reviews  I was nervous  One in paricular mentioned prostitutes using the hotel bar  We stayed for a week and I can honelsty say that the management must have cleaned up their act not one prostitute in sight  The hotel is small by Dubai standards giving it a cozy feel  We had an executive King room and it was HUGE  The bed was gigantic and very comfortable  Whilst the pool is small it was never too busy and sunbeds were always available  The pool staff were excellent We ate at the pool bar a number of times and found the quality excellent  Likewise the food in the Bar downstairs was delicious  A good selection of breakfast foods were available Whilst not on Jameirah Beach  the hotel is very well located  A taxi to the beach costs approx     The ina and downtown areas were easly accessible  Taxis were easy to find  There is a monorail station beside the hotel but it is not open yet  The Mall of Emirates is less than a five minute walk away  All and all a great little hotel which I would happily stay at again 
P =>   Good hotel for short business trip   Stayed here twice this year   first visit      when the Hotel opened I believe  not long anyway   What a difference in the way the room was made up each day  On my first visit it was faultless  the staff and in particular room service couldn t do enough and the room had all the complimentary items as you would expect  topped up  every day without fail  This time around  room service was way below the standard you d expect from a four star hotel and was not brilliant  We stayed   nights  on at least   of the days I had to call housekeeping to arrange for complimentary coffee   milk   water and on one occasion we had no bath towels   Just poor room make up  Overall the Hotel is centrally  non city  located and ideal if you wish to visit Palm Island  Dubai ina Jebel Ali etc  It is also quite close to the Jumeirah Hotels  No shuttle service but taxis are cheap  There is also a metro station in the Mall of the Emirates  snow dome etc    min walk away   its ideal  There is also a metro station just outside the hotel and should be open in a month s time Much cheaper to eat in the Mall of the Emirates than the Hotel   Hotel restaurants minimum meal price is AED             per person  Mall of Emirates AED          FOR TWO  Lovely curry  chinese  lebanese meals for less than half the price  You can go even cheaper of you eat at KFC  McDs  BurgerKing etc Would I recommend the Hotel   I think yes  if you know what standard you want  If it is beach with beach type views then no   visit a Jumeriah chain hotel  Hotel gym is very good  great new equipment  Life Fitness    Asif the gym instructor is excellent  what a pleasant chap  The Hotel is just off the main Sheik Zayed Freeway and traffic can be heard from the rooftop pool   bar areas  however  this didn t cause too much of an issue  Hotel drinks are expensive         for a beer  small bottle   No free WIFI   what a great loss   You can obtain   hr free use in the  lounge  bar of you spend AED      on food drink  WIFI should be free as it is primarily a business hotel  Free WIFI cvan be found at Dubai ina coffee shops in the ina Walk  Dubai Mall  the worlds largest shopping mall next to Bur Dubai   the worlds tallest building  Overall the hotel is more top end of   to lower end of   star rating but still worth a visit  
P =>   Nice place lovely rooms This place seems pretty new   the rooms are really nice and modern  Great facilities   nice pool on the roof  good gym  internet etc    Overall good value for money by Dubai standards  Great location too   only   minutes walk to the Metro station and Mall of the Emirates If you don t want to spend heaps of money on a hotel in Dubai but you want a nice comfortable place to stay in a good location  then I would definitely recommend this place  
P =>   An Oasis in the desert Amazing Hotel   everything spot on  Clean  comfortable  friendly  Customer Service    out of     Food very good   buffet with plenty of variety  Stayed during Ramadan so used room service for lunch  Very prompt service and food very nice and well presented  Good facilities in business centre  
P =>   Very good hotel but has some misses Pros  New and Very Clean Staff other then the front desk staff are excellent Big Rooms Comfortable beds Restaurants and Bars are good Located a   min walk from the Mall of the EmiratesCons The area in front of the hotel is a dirt road that still hasn t been paved despite the fact that the hotel is over a year old  Front desk staff are not the friendliest Lounge chairs around the pool are awful  Very uncomfortable Internet is no faster then dial up despite the fact that it s a new hotel and they charge you almost        
P =>   nice and cheap hotel great hotel stayed there for    nights and flights cost     pound want bad at all nice breakfast nice staff 
P =>   Value for money Good hotel and staff  not for families due location  but good value stop for Dubai  Expensive WiFi tho 
P =>   Good value for Dubai Stayed here for a   night trip and was exactly what we needed  Had a superior room at the front of the hotel with a great view of the Burj Al Arab The room was huge  I guess it was    feet to the TV from the bed The rooftop pool is OK to cool off and is open until      pm  but you do get the road noise from the    lanes of traffic down below  A warning   beer is not cheap by the pool  I paid the equivalent of    for a can of lager The Mall of the Emirates is   minutes walk away  maybe TOO convinient  with all those shops inside  Use the brown Dubai cabs instead of the  expensive  white lexus cars connected to the hotel  
P =>   Great place for a short stay After all the good recommendations we decided to try this hotel as well and indeed  very good Friendly service  clean rooms which are bright and nicely done  You can see in all the fixtures it is a holiday inn but if you are only there to sleep  perfectly fine  Our room overlooked the burj al arab as well as the highway  however you don t hear the noise I would definitively recommend the hotel for short stays and a nice budget price However  if you are staying longer and would like to have a balcony and really nice view there are better options 
P =>  Great hotel highly recommend A friend and I took a double room suite at the hotel which was great  We had our own space and bathrooms and a nice sitting room  The hotel is lovely   a huge airy atrium  I am very sensitive to noise and the hotel was quite and we both got great sleep while there  The beds are really comfortable too  The rooftop pool is lovely and the gym is nice too  We didn t eat in the hotel  but friends say that the food there is good  Staff were excellent and incredible friendly and helpful  I particularly like the mini card information stand in the lobby   very helpful  Walking distance to Mall of Emirates too which is a bonus  I moved to a single room after my friend left which was also great  
P =>   Brilliant hotel well worth the money My Boyfriend and I have just come back from staying at the Holiday Inn Al Barsha           All I can say is that the most of the previous reviews I had read on tripadvisor about the hotel were spot on   It was a great hotel  really clean  friendly staff  comfortable rooms  and an ideal location The Mall of Emirates is just a   min walk away     min in the    degree heat   Jemeriah beach    min taxi ride away  Dubai Mall    min taxi ride away  Plus taxis are absolutely everywhere and cheap  so you will have no problems there  The hotel has a gym and pool on the rooftop  restaurants are are also available  although we only ate in the Royal Buddha once which was really nice  The bar staff do a lovely Strawberry Daiquiri cocktail  but there not cheap and cocktails are not included in the happy hour which runs from     pm  The staff were really friendly and couldn t do enough to help us  they were always making sure we were o k  suggesting ideas on where we could go or what we could do Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to just about anyone  My boyfriend and I certainly enjoyed our stay there and enjoyed Dubai on a whole as there is so much to do and see  I plan to go back next year and will most probably stay at the Holiday Inn Al Barsha again  
P =>   Fantastic hotel worth the   stars Well worth the four stars  and deserves better than     in dubai  at the time of writing   One bit of advice I would give is haggle  although your not in a souk  the prices are slightly fake  for instance breakfast was quoted at different prices and we paid    UAE for the two of us for   days  they quoted     per day or     per week  The luxury taxi  a new Lexus driver took us to the airport for    UAE although others paid     this could be down to traffic   time of day   Front desk staff were fast and friendly  and concierge were brilliant and their English was good compared to out and about The gym was well equipped and pool was clean and tidy with a great view  The room was very nice  not sure if we got upgraded but it was a large room with good air con  mini bar  and large LCD TV Regarding an earlier comment on beware of extra charges  we were a little concerned about this as an extra     could spoil the bargain  we booked with lastminute com and it was all included so we had nothing to pay on checkout The breakfast was not bland  far from it  large buffet with changed certain items each day  and had the best fresh coffee served by the superb waiter who would not let your cup run empty  We dined inside the hotel   nights the Royal Buddha twice and the asia buffet one night  The Royal Buddha was the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to  and we discovered it had won several awards for the best Thai restaurant in Dubai     read the time out review online  The all you can eat Asian buffet restaurant was good value for money at   UAE p p       Location was good  close to the Mall of the Emirates where we went sking one day  a bit mad when it was    C outside      Taxi s are very cheap so cheap to get to the beach   creek   Atlantis Palm The only thing that lets this hotel down is the brand  as in the UK Holiday Inn is regarded as a budget hotel chain  be ICS should re brand the quality hotels   
P =>   Excellent Value Hotel In Dubai Stayed in The Holiday Inn for   nights with my girlfriend and really enjoyed this place The Hotel is on Sheikh Zayed Road with good views of Burj Al Arab Hotel and Jumeirah Beach from The Rooftop Bar and from the swimming pool It is only a   minute walk to Mall of the Emirates which is handy for any shopping or if you wanted something to eat day or night The hotel is located around     yards from one of the Metro Stops for the new Dubai Metro which opens in tember which will be a good travelling option for Dubai as traffic can be hectic there The hotel has a rooftop swimming pool and although not very big it does the job and serves drink and light snacks during the day There is a vey good bar on the ground floor which has a happy hour from    to   each day and was a pleasnat way to spend an evening or two We tried the Thai Restaurant and although expensive the food was excellent There will be an Indian Restaurant Opening up soon which should be good The hotel overall was very good and the Staff vere very pleasant and proffessionell and we will probably stay there next time we go to Dubai 
P =>  Great Place   can recommend unhesitatingly This place is just fine  The rooms are small  sure  but there is decent room service  the bar is excellent  it is spotless  the gym has a great instructor called Aziz  a luxury hotel taxi to the airport is a mere Dhrs   if you pay cash     and all one could perhaps wish for is free internet in the lobby  It s Four Star but really lives up to its claim to provide Five Star facilities  I stayed on Priority Club points  just        at the time of writing  which made it an even better deal  but as a functional business hotel in the Mall of the Emirates area  it would surely take some beating if you are paying yourself  
P =>   brand new property A brand new property when I visited in        Stayed for a week  This is an ideal location for those who have business in the jabel Ali area and also at the internet city and all other business locations towards the Jabel Ali region  It s away from the maddening traffic in the city  From a p it s about    minutes drive  You can reach Abu Dhabi also from this hotel  The Autrium is good  make sure that you get a room whicv faces out rather than one which faces the autrium  The break fast is somewhat bland  but dinner is excellent with lots of Arabic varieties  
P =>  Better than   star My children and I arrived at this hotel late at night but received a nice welcome  We then ordered room service which was well presented and beautiful  The most pleasant surprise was the room  I booked a two bedroom suite and it was massive  The beds were king size and were the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in  must find out where to buy that mattress    The staff were friendly  particularly Immy up at the pool  Unfortunately we were only there two days because we all wanted to stay longer Location is good  within   minute walk to Mall of Emirates with Ski Dubai  Dubai is quite spread out so I don t think it maters where you stay  Shopping was not cheap there but worth a walk  There a few bars and restaurants in the hotel which all looked nice and I believe there are more opening up  The service and the facilities were equal to many five star hotels I have stayed at  Overall  perfect stay for all of us  
P =>  Made my family happy    I live in Dubai and decided to treat my mum and sister to a   day holiday  They ABSOLUTELY LOVED this hotel and said it was much better then they ever expected  The staff went out of their way to be extremely friendly  The room was clean and beautifuly decorated with the most comfortable beds  The pool had FANTASTIC views of the Jumerirah coast line and one of the best views in town of the Burj Al Arab  It was a lovely pool area was really nice  with lovely wicker leaf shaped sun loungers  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone coming to visit Dubai  It is also in a great central location and there are always cabs outside We ate in two of the restaurants the arabic and the thai and both were good  I have to say the Thai food was some of the best in Dubai and the Thai restaurant staff were really really friendly Given the price of this hotel compared to some of the   star hotels on Jumeriah beach which are   times as much     if you are contemplating a value visit to Dubai PLEASE STAY HERE you really will be happy with the choice  Coming from Dubai I can only say that other hotels in the same price range as the Holiday Inn do not come close    so book it now Also I have a very happy mum and sister who are still raving to everyone about their amazing holiday in Dubai and it was the Holiday Inn they said that made their stay extra special due to the friendliness of the staff  
P =>   st class Excellent hotel  very good service  spotlessly clean  The staff go out of their way to make your stay a pleasure  Good choice of food whatever time of day  the gym on the top floor is very good  the pool area is a little on the small side  but pleasurable all the same  Be careful on the sun beds  one move to the side and youre on the floor  The new shopping mall is virtually next door  taxis are plentifull  however only use the metred cars  all the rest are twice the price  When you check out they are paranoid you have used the mini bar and wont let you leave until its been checked  
P =>   Stunning Hotel with great service with the best Thai restaurant I was recommended by a friend to stay the The holiday Inn Al Barsha in Dubai  I was very impressed by this beautiful and well decorated hotel  my bedroom was amazing with a very confortable bed and very clean  all the hotel staff were very helpfull and professional  The breakfast has a very good selection of food  very tasty and great service  One evening I had dinner with friends at the Royal Budhal Thai restaurant at the Hotel  The Chef came to the table to recommend some dishes to us  The meal was outstanding  I had the best thai red chicken curry I have ever had  The delicious rice was served from a large and elegant basket  I had a truly enjoyable stay and I would recommend this great hotel to everyone travelling to Dubai  
P =>  Brilliant Hotel We loved this Hotel  Reception very helpful  we were in room within minutes  All staff on reception very helpful  The room was lovely  We had a meal in the restaurant which was excellent  There is a nice bar where you can enjoy the odd cocktail in Happy Hour and very welcome without being intrusive  The location was perfect as only there for   night as boarding a Cruise  We spent a very nice shopping day in the Emirates Mall and saw the ski resort which was amazing  I would highly recommend this hotel especially with the Priority Points  Only advice never take the Hotel Taxi when in Dubai always use the oficial Taxi s which are all metered so you will not get ripped off  All our Taxi drivers we met were extremely nice and often offered good advice  
P =>   Nice Hotel Good Location Friendly Staff Small Rooms The hotel is very nice actually and it was even better than what I expected  The hotel has all modern facilities and is designed nicely  All of the hotel s staff were friendly  The only negative point about this hotel was the room size  
P =>   No complaints Had an executive room on  nd floor  Check in was pleasant and were in room within minutes There is some building work going on  but what s new in Dubai  Its literally   to   minutes walk to the Mall of the Emirates Never had an issue in getting any taxi s  although the one time we used the  hotels own taxi s  I was charged thrice what I would have been charged by a normal taxi Comfortable rooms  the tv channels are not great  Used the steam sauna and staff in gym are very helpful Didnt try any of the hotel dinings facilities and the bar is not open yet  Internet is available at    AED for   hours use in the business centre  Hotel and rooms are new obviously  If I had a gripe  it was only small  in that there was never enough tea and cream in the room As stated  no complaints and easy enough to find by any taxi driver back from downtown  jumeriah  internet city  any of the malls  
P =>  Had an excellent time at this hotel  Booked this hotel online for   nights on a Dinner  Bed  amp  Breakfast rate for a reasonable amount of money  But was quite cost effective compared to similar hotels in Dubai  When we got to the hotel  wasn t impressed  as it had some building work being carried out  outside the hotel  But as I came accustomed to with all of Dubai  it is a big building site  However there wasn t much noise from the work being carried out Checking in took a while and even then the room wasn t what I was promised  After a call down to reception  they moved us to another room        The view was amazing   Had excellent view of the Burj al Arab  Jumeriah Beach Hotel  Atlantis in the distance  as was the Burj Arab  Couldn t have asked for a better view The room itself was extremely nice and clean  We had tea and coffee  bottled water provided  The TV was a flat screen and had all sorts of channels from across the world  Beds were really comfy and gave me a wonderful sleep every time  As other reviewers have said  it is built next to the Sheikh Zayed Rd  and that noise from traffic could be a problem for some light sleepers  but Id have the view every time Both breakfast and dinner  that I booked in the rate  were served in the Gem Garden restaurant  The breakfast was really nice and fresh  consisted of cooked breakfast  different types of eggs  continental  some arabic and indian  No complaints  Dinner on the other hand was from a set menu  and although they did try to change it everyday  it did get a bit boring  Also there wasn t much choice if you were vegetarian but they did accommodate if requested  But the food that was served was excellent  looked beautiful and tasted magnificent  It would have been nice to have dinner elsewhere in the hotel under the dinner rate offer  but was told it wasn t possible Both the gym and swimming pool were nice and the staff eager to help at all times Tried to use the business centre to check in online but was told it would cost us   AED        for   hour  I made a bit of a fuss over this as it was only going to take  minutes maximum  after a lot of explaining and looking disappointed  I was told I could use the computer on the luggage desk All the staff were really friendly and truly made the stay at the hotel a enjoyable one  would definitely stay here again  Hopefully it will be much better when the metro is running  as a station is being built   minute walk away  Otherwise the Mall of the Emirates is about   minute walk away  If you wanted to go anywhere else then you would need a taxi  
P =>   Nice rooms and handy location   but really noisy Booked this hotel using Priority Club points to extend a business stay and enjoy some of Dubai s tourist attractions  Conveniently located about   minutes walk from the  Mall of the Emirates  and within about    minutes drive of the Burj Al Arab and the upmarket resort hotels on the southern end of Jumeirah Beach  this location represents a good choice for those looking for easy access to Dubai s newer attractions  The downside however is that the hotel is just meters from the Sheikh Zayed Rd   a    lane highway which is busy       and the new Dubai Metro line  Be prepared for a lot of road   traffic noise   especially if you use the small but functional rooftop pool and sundeck  It s like trying to sunbathe next to the Monaco rally  Another real turn off is the fiddly road access if you re driving   you need to drive throughtthe busy Mall car park to get on  amp  off the highway  At peak times this can add         minutes minimum to your car journey Rooms are modern  nicely furnished and very comfortable indeed   one of the nicest hotel beds ever  The public areas are OK but the service was only so so compared with other hotels in Dubai  Watch out too for the exhorbitant costs for internet usage and also for breakfast  At AED    approx            per person it is very overpriced in relation to the quality and selection available  Try the fabulous breakfast menu at Paul  French Bakery  in the Mall  instead  
P =>   A taste of Dubai   star service Stayed here in early        The hotel is new and offers an excellent environment and service  This was out third trip to Dubai  previously we have stayed at LRM and GHH   however we needed a  quot cheap quot  break  I have to say that both my husband and I were extremely impressed and would not hesitate to go back  The hotel is excellent value for money  offers a wonderful level of service and the rooms were as good as both the other hotels we have stayed in Dubai previously  On arrival  we were early for check in  we were dealt with quickly and given an upgrade  The room was spacious  clean and comfortable  We tried two of the restaurants in the hotel  the arabic restaurant offered     of the price and offered amazing food  We were disappointed that when we went back on the Monday  it was closed  We had three courses each of traditional arabic food  and excellent service for approx      wine is expensive as in all hotels in Dubai   The other restaurant was just as good  but unfortunately we didnt try the sushi or Thai restaurants  The Sports bar had happy hour between   pm and  pm with all drinks half price  well worth a visit  although you are allowed to smoke in here and it can become smoky  You are a short walk from the Mall of the Emirates which is great for eating out as long as you dont mind not having alcohol  The hotel rates itself as four star  and in Dubai this is probably about right  although I have to say that it is trying very hard to be five star and it is succeeding in respect of the service  The minus points are that it has a small pool on the roof and is located on Sheik Zayed Rd which can be noisy when you are on the roof but you dont hear it in the hotel  Some of the bars are not fully open yet  including a champagne bar  but if you want a taste of the excellent service and hotels in Dubai for good value for money  including points nights  then this is the hotel to try  
P =>   Great Hotel The decoration of the hotel is superb  Everything oozes with quality The bed is comfortable  the air conditioning quiet Satellite tv is provided  with a large wide screen flat panel tv in the room Please note I stayed in the hotel in winter with the outside air temperature being    degrees celcius  My concern would be whether the aircon keeps on working when you re out of the room   the room card key turns the power on and off to the room If not  then the room may get hot in summer where the external temperature can hit     and take a while to cool down It s very easy to get a taxi from the hotel  without having to wait long  The staff are friendly   as all UAE people seem to be   and helpful The hotel is situated approximately   minutes walk from the Mall of the Emirates shopping centre which has shops open to midnight  In the Emirates mall you can even go skiing on snow I didn t eat in the hotel so I am not able to comment on the quality of food  but given the amazing internal condition of the hotel and food I ate elsewhere in Dubai  I would expect the food to in the hotel to be good too The only negative points I have are a Breakfast is expensive at    dirhams b Internet connection is not free  it s    dirhams per day However  there is WiFi available in the Mall of the Emirates shopping centre  but I can t say whether that is free or not  but there were always young people sitting in the mall using it  
P =>   Absolutely Lovely  The staff were ever ready to please Stayed at the hotel with a female friend from the  th  th  We were pleased that the hotel is situated a mere  mins walk from Mall of the Emirates  Nice design  spacious lobby and welcoming staff  The standard room was a teeny weeny cramped but the decor more than made up for the lack of space  Room service was prompt and food served was filling and delicious  We made sure we tried out most of the menu  Had a good time at the gym with very helpful personal trainers  The downside being it wasnt opened   hrs  It wouldve been helpful to burn some calories after our midnite feasts  The Thai restaurant on the ground floor serves some seriously tasty green curry  Watch out for the chilli though  The bellboys couldnt do enough for us  Smiling through and helping with our hundredth shopping bag  all within the first day  flagging down taxis for us and generally assisting with any enquiries we may have at any time of the day  Security was pretty good too  Reception called more than twice to ascertain that we are indeed expecting guests  Our room was always very well cleaned out with fresh supplies of towels and toiletries  Ensure you put out the  quot Do not disturb quot  sign out though  otherwise the shrill noise of the housekeeper ring is bound to rouse u rather abruptly from the warm cocoon of the comfortable bed  All in all  we were very pleasantly surprised with this    hotel  In our eyes  it had all    quality  Special thankks to Khalid at the Reception  Ken at the Concierge desk  We ll surely visit again  
P =>  Good Business Hotel Not So Good if its the Beach You Want Selected the hotel as it was mid way between down town and the residential district  the hotel is now fully open  with liquor licence and all restaurants  however  the roof top bar was still under construction Check in was good and easy  a bit slow but that s the Middle East  The room I was upgraded to  Priority Platinum Member  was on the front with the big panoramic view  no real road noise The service and helpfulness of the staff was very good and could find no fault  on the down side the bar was very expensive  so are all bars in Dubai   the restaurants are also expensive  but the portions are large If you want the beach or nightlife  this is not the hotel for you  but what you want is only a taxi ride away  and they are cheap   but for me there on business  comfy bed  good and varied food it was fine The hotel was only partly full when I was there  so the extent of service under high occupancy conditions was not experienced  I think they would struggle  Would stay there again   yes if the criteria for my stay were the same  
P =>   Hidden Cost and Confusion The hotels position is rather isolated  although surrounded by other buildings and or building sites its a bit of an island  the constant roar of traffic on the racetrack that is the Sheikh Zayed Rd at the front cutting it off from that direction  The Mall of the Emirates and indoor ski slope is approx     yds away The Holiday Inn Al Barsha is new and at time of staying had still to achieve a liquor licence and properly open all its catering offers  All the staff were pleasant but the desk staff could be very surly and there is a problem of communication between the back office and desk  Booking instructions and billing arrangements not being passed to the front desk and when queried questions not checked with the back office  The house keeping staff were all Asian and very pleasant but if asked anything it was apparent that they didn t understand but would nod cheerfully The rooms are fine and kept pristine with towels changed daily  however my room had a problem with the aircon  Whatever was done with the thermostat it ran constantly at the same speed and tempeture  Colleagues reported the same experience with their rooms  The TV channels are limited with most being Arabic  Internet is currently free but confusing to operate and very slow response times  Use of the phone very expensive with charge being made immediately you dial even if no connection made Although only one restaurant was operating I found it expensive although offering a diverse buffet choice  
P =>  bien situ   Ski Dubai et Jumeirah   
P => 
P => decent peaceful location near dubai knowledge village and internet city  Ample car parking and decent price of     dollars for a room for    could be attractive if priced around    dollars  breakfast was simple and not too many choices  ample car parking is available and located minutes from the new dubai area of marina  jumeirah beach residence  mall of emirates etc  the access to the hotel could be difficult except by cab or car as it is not in the heart of the city would stay again if similar price or better deals  
P =>   Great decent priced hotel in Internet City area next to Dubai Knowledge Village  I paid       night  as part of a regular trip I make to Dubai to teach for Gulf Photo Plus  We are put up in the Holiday Inn each year  and this hotel has made me a fan If you have business in the Dubai Knowledge Village  you could hardly do better than this hotel for the money They have a shuttle that runs to DXB airport  or you can grab a cab pretty cheaply Rooms are very nice    clean  simple  etc  Internet is a weak link    expensive and not fast  But you can get it free next door in the cafe court of DKV  Just punch in any properly formatted phone number gleaned from any nearby flyer and you are in Breakfast is a mix of western and middle eastern  The little chocolate croissants will add to your caloric intake for your entire stay   If you want to make a cold cut sandwich at breakfast  ask for condiments from behind the counter    they have them  The Vista Bar atop the hotel is where to go    sheesha  beers  and a fantastic view on the balmy nights  We closed the place most nights during the week long events Cabs are cheap to anywhere  hey  gas is only a dollar a gallon  but you can get good food at the cafe court in DKV  across the parking lot behind the hotel  The indian place is very good  BTW  But lots of typical fast food options  too Very serviceable hotel  and will make your stay near DKV worry free  Recommended  
P =>   Great for a short stopover  We stopped in Dubai for a couple of nights on our way to Italy  Taxi drivers had trouble finding the place sometimes but all in all better than expected  Its a budget hotel and a good price for a good location  They also offered a free shuttle to the Mall of the Emirates  
P =>   Vista the restaurant is a hidden gem I m a Dubai based journalist  I ve never stayed at the hotel so can t comment on the rooms  but I visited Vista to do a review and feel obliged to shout from the rooftops how great it was  I have to say I wasn t expecting much   this is a Holiday Inn Express for God s sake   but the food was genuinely delicious and the staff were unfailingly polite and helpful In a city where many restaurants charge half a month s wages for a bottle of water and the food is ok but not great  Vista really stood out as somewhere charging reasonable prices for good grub  Furthermore  the decor was stylish and the views of the Burj Al Arab  if outside temperatures will allow you to check them out  are superb  
P =>   when on a string     it s fine Stayed   nights at Holiday Inn Express  Usually stay at more upscale places    star and up  but client booked this one for me so there was no discussion  Overall  I can t say it was a bad experience  Lobby is large and clean with accommodating staff  although their English is mediocre  Rooms are small but tidy and bathroom is as big as many of the more upscale and expensive places  water pressure in shower was good too  No noise issues as often happens in other Dubai hotels  thin walls  amp  loud guests   Choice at breakfast is limited  but the quality is quite okay  Gym is tiny and a few of the machines were not working  under repair   Taxi drivers know the place  so no need to wait for hours and hours for a ride  In short  this hotel is fine if you re on a budget in Dubai  
P =>   Good value for money A good hotel to a reasonable price for a business trip when you need somewhere to sleep and a breakfast in the morning  Clean and nice rooms and have everything you need but not more  The included breakfast buffet is not so varied with a basic assortment of bread and become a little bit boring after some days  If you don t want to eat your dinner at the quite costly hotel restaurant I will recommend you visit the University food court only five minutes walk from the hotel  I recommend you to not use the hotels own taxi service because you will pay nearly the double price compared with the  normal  taxis  As sum up this is a good basic hotel for your stay in Dubai if you don t have really high expectations of personal service  
P =>  Nice Hotel We needed to attend the book fair at Abu Dhabi and also had appointments in Dubai  This is almost at the edge of Dubai towards Abu Dhabi so the hotel suited us fine  Always missed the traffic  Very convenient if you are renting  Free parking  Very clean  Nice breakfast  Really enjoyed my stay  
P =>   Sightseeing Holiday As a base this hotel met all our requirements  The staff were very helpful and pleasant and always greeted you with a smile and hello  The location was excellent for getting anywhere you wanted to go  the taxis are very cheap  We had excellent accommodation and washing facilities and the breakfast was lovely  cold buffet  good selection of foods I would highly recommend using one of these hotels for this type of holiday  it offers everything you need  good value all round and I would not hesitate to use it again  Also it benefitted from having an excellent restaurant called the Vista next to it  I had some of the best food there and I have eaten in many of the Restaurants in Dubai  put it on your list of must dos  
P => 	star hotel     star service Always stay at this hotel when I am in Dubai  Management and staff are friendly efficient and attentive without being sycophantic   Big problem in this part of the world   The rooms are large always immaculate in regards to cleanliness and the housekeeping staff provide the same standard of service as their counterparts  quot downstairs  quot I wouldn t want to stay anywhere else when I am in Dubai  
P =>   So cool enough to visit more and more A Five stars service from all hotel staff and managers  I have worked in many parts of the world and stayed in some serious hotels but nothing compares with the relaxed atmosphere in this hotel  
P =>  Eh it was ok  Considering I spent only about      per night  I wasn t expecting much  Yes  the hotel is a little out of the way but I found that most of the city is spread out as it is  There were usually taxis available in front and if not  the bellhop would get one to pick up quickly  I was annoyed by the internet fees  especially because the connection was fairly slow  All in all  it was just an average hotel in an awesome city  Next time  I will probably stay closer to city center  
P =>  a great place to stay I don t normally review hotels but as I stayed at the Holiday Inn at exactly the same time as the previous reviewer I thought I d just add that I found the staff helpful and considerate  my shower worked fine  the bed was comfortable  and the hotel was ideally placed for the event I was attending  As for the internet  yes  it was expensive  by UK standards at least  but it worked and was reliable  I should also add that I stayed here last year  would stay here again  and have no issues in recommending this hotel to anyone else  
P =>  Wonderful Stay I have stayed in express by Holiday inn Internet City early       and one of the nicest simple standard rooms  The hotel atmosphere from the check in until check out was great  It is really wonderful management to keep the place warm  friendly and very peaceful atmosphere  
P =>  too good to be an Express i stayed there several times and all have been great  the rooms are very clean and front desk are friendly and helpfull  however  i could nt underatand the big change in rate       i stayed for      while in     it was above       location is great if you want to get away from Dubai traffic  many attraction points are close by not to mention the nearby petrol station which has a nice mini market and a fast food place highly recommended  
P =>  Holiday Inn   Could be a    Hotel  The Holiday Inn in Internet City is a hidden gem of Dubai  It s a great location for the ina and the newly opened Walk by JBR  Mall of the Emirates is only    minutes dive away also  The rooms are well above the normal Holiday Inn rooms and the walk in shower is fab  The desk is large enough to comfortably work   and the tv is in a new plasma format  The staff are all friendly and willing to help out  considering how expensive the hotels in Dubai are   for a clean and comfortable base I wouldn t hesitate to recommend it  
P =>  A Holiday Inn Express Experience I arrived at this hotel less than a week ago  and I m booked in until the end of ember      The staff are all very friendly  courteous and helpful  Nothing is too much trouble The rooms are standard decor  with comfortable beds  a decent desk workstation area  and a very soothing power shower Breakfast is slightly disappointing  probably because I m booked in here for so long   the same limited choice for so many days      There s a choice of breads  cereals  yoghurts  cheese  cold meat  and fresh fruit  plus juices and hot drinks  when the coffee machine hasn t broken down  The hotel is not in the best of locations  and it is sometimes difficult to get a taxi  even if you ask reception or security to call you one  I waited for    minutes today  then gave up  My biggest gripe is the internet access and the way it is charged  I bought    hours access   logged on and sent a couple of emails  then logged off the internet  all as per the compulsory pop up box  I went to the bar for a couple of drinks before returning to my room  When I logged back on  the  quot meter quot  advised that I had only    hours and    minutes left  even though I d only been on for    minutes earlier that evening  What is the point of having a button that says  quot Log off the internet quot  if  in fact  it does not stop the clock from counting down   Come on guys  you must be able to offer your customers a better deal than this I d welcome the opportunity to discuss this face to face with k  the General Manager   
P =>   nothing good except Vista Unless your company is in Internet City  please do not stay here  you will be disappointed especially if you have stayed in other hotels closer to Dubai  Its an overpriced USA Best Western experience I stayed in       and again in         It was bad in ruary and just as bad in ember  The front desk service is barely acceptable  but atleast polite  Its quite difficult for your driver to find the front entrance due to lack of signage  No irons in the room and it takes forever to get one when you call and ask  The rooms are small and the beds are hard  The location is terrible unless your company happens to be in Internet City also  Ironically  in Internet City  the internet connection is so slow   maybe like a fast dial up connection  The free continental breakfast is quite limited  Croissants      types of fruit    cereals  yogurt and coffee juice The only good thing about the hotel is the Vista restaurant which has ok food  good service and a great view of Burj Al Arab  dine outside at night and bring a good camera with atleast a    mm zoom lens Probably the most frustrating thing as a business traveler is that they charge your credit card at check in and then charge the difference at check out  So you have two transactions on your CC   neither of which match up to the receipt you submit with your expense report The worst thing is the location  there is nothing to do out there  no place else to eat at night except Vista without taking a car  Without any traffic  its at best    minutes from the airport 
P =>   Bad location The was clean and new  But the bad thing was the location  The hotel is located deep inside Dubai Internet City and it was confusing to drive to the hotel  The hotel s breakfast was basic  There were no close restaurants or even grocery stores   The closest place where you could find restaurants or stores is the Emirates Mall which took me more than    minutes reach there  Then  you would need to find an empty parking spot and go all over the mall for the food court or the Hypermarket  I think this hotel will give you good value for money if you are sleeping there only and you will leave the hotel in the morning and not come back till late at night  
P => 	  over priced This is the worst hotel I have everstayed at  The shower is luke warm  the breakfast is terrible and their is no service  In fact when I complained they remarked we are a   star hotel not at   star  I have stayed their two times  because it is close to my office  one time it was       per night and the other it was      per night  Well it is over priced at       DO NOT STAY HERE    
P =>   Superb value and good location If you want a consistently high level of cleanliness and comfort at a very reasonable rate  especially for Dubai  you will be hard pressed to find a hotel in Jumeriah that will beat this one Only a few minutes taxi ride from Souq Madinat  The Palm  Jumeriah Beach  Buddha Bar  Barasti Bar and numerous over top quality hotels and restaurants Before I moved back to Dubai I used this hotel a lot and was never disappointed  also has a good bar which serves good food and has a great view from the veranda Take it from me I live here   
P =>   Middle of Nowhere Bad Internet Service First trip to Dubai  and as work was in the  quot Knowledge Village quot  area of Internet City  Dubai I selected this Holiday Inn Express  Long time Intercontinental Hotel member  so that usually works to my advantage Hotel only eight months old  so clean and nice design As a business traveller I am reliant on broadband access at hotels  and for a place called  quot internet City quot  this hotel was pitiful  especially when being charged AED    per day  Manager admitted that they new the speeds were inadequate  only  MB connection for entire hotel  and suggested an upgrade was in process   to  MB  As DSL users routinely have   MB  connections at home  you can see how poor a connection shared across the whole hotel can be And I ve always liked Holiday Inn s Express brand for the great HOT breakfast they advertise  No such luck here  cold cuts and rolls   typical German Fruhstuck and nothing like Holiday Inn s ads Third point  NOTHING is walking distance  Not a shop  not a restaurant  not NOTHING  Taxis are cheap in Dubai but many have trouble finding this new hotel in an area far from the city  
P =>  better than any Holiday Inn Express in the states This hotel is brand new  and quite nice looking  The only issue I had with the accommodations was the shower handle falling off and the shower draining very slowly  Both issues were promptly resolved after talking to the front desk  The complimentary breakfast is amazing  It is about a    to    minute drive from central Dubai  but given the price I found it worthwhile to stay here  
P =>   Gets better and better I first stayed at this hotel in ober and did rate the stay as very good  However I have recently returned to what I can only describe as first class lodging with exceptional service The reception desk staff was extremly helpful and polite and even offered to take my luggage up when they they not provide such service at the express Rooms are still well kept  well stocked and very clean  The highlight of the stay was dinner at the new restaurant on the roof that was not open when I first visited The view from Vista is breath taking and the food and service can compare to the best resturants in towm minus the high prices  Well done the Express and I look forward to my next stay Charles 
P =>   Great New Hotel Near the ina This new hotel in the Knowledge Village area of Dubai  close to the new Dubai ina and Emirates Mall is a great value close to many new attractions  The service is not the same as the top five star hotels but it is very friendly and efficient  The lobby is very modern and large with wireless internet access available  The rooms are not huge but large enough to have a bed and small sofa  Wired high speed internet in the rooms fo    AED a day Breakfast is included with all rooms but don t expect a grand buffett  There are only cold items with coffee and juices  There is a surprisingly nice restaurant on the top floor which is not affiliated with the hotel  The food there was really nicely prepared and the service was great  Not very pricey either  You can t beat the view of the marina area from up there   especially when you go out on the deck and have some shisha The restaurant in the hotel lobby serves lunch and dinner but  still has service issues to work out  They were very understaffed the one time I ate there and it took forever to get a simple sandwich  Free parking in the underground garage was very helpful since having a car made it this location a lot easier  It is not right on a main street so taxis are not always available immediately Overall  this hotel is a good choice for someone looking for a nice but  not so expensive place in the ina side of town  
P =>   Fantastic hotel I am a regular business traveller  I have stayed there from uary  nd till uary   th hotel is fantastic  one of the best Holiday Inn Express I have ever stay This hotel has assembled a wonderful team  from Reception  management to restaurant wait staff   I was delighted by the friendliness and  quot extra mile quot  helpfulness of all the staff  always smiley faces   Incredible staff   always available and extremely helpful The in room high speed internet is quite good and reasonably priced  wifi in the lobby  cheap taxi ride to the beach  shopping malls like Emirates mall and Ibn Batuta mall The hotel was spotless  very reasonable prices  located in the TECOM area whereas Media city  Internet city and Knowledge village  they have a fabulous restaurant on the roof top I think it s called Vista with an excellent panoramic view overlook the Burj Alarab and Palm Jumeirah  serves great food the best fillet steak  I have tried shisha on the terrace it is fantastic Value for money I would stay here again  highly recommended for business travelers  
P => Brand New but COLD Water If you like cold showers this is the place for you  We called maintenance and they tracked dirt through the room to  quot fix quot  the problem  But the problem was NOT fixed  Only staying one night so I asked for a small discount to compensate my problem  The clerked grinned and said sorry Great view of the Burj al Arab nearby though  Relatively close to the Hard Rock Cafe too Never again will I stay here  
P =>   A bad experience There are lot of problems faced in there for the two dat stay  and follwing are the main grivences As per the documents they said they have iron box but asked twice at reception and the receptinist also agreed to send the iron box   but never delivered to the room As per the booking i was offered the late check out but at the time of check  in the recptinist refused you have car it is ok  otherwise save some money for taxis  They have a small shop for essentials   but price is exhorbitent  There s continental breakfast included in the room rate I was afraid it will be too simple   only toast and jam And some of the staff attitude is really not hospitable at all  
P =>   Nice one Nice new hotel in Knowledge village  near to Ibn Battuta Mall and ina somehow Burj Al Arab and Mall of Emirates  far from Deira  If you have car it is ok  otherwise save some money for taxis  The room is nice i only missed more closets  There s continental breakfast included in the room rate I was afraid it will be too simple but there was quitte a choice its not only toast and jam but if u like to spoil yourself with scrambled eggs and warm sausages don t count on it  Cleaning of room seemed to be bit slow sometimes they reached room after  pm maybe there wasn t enough stuff on the floor  But i can reccomend to stay here if your are looking for nice and not too expensive hotel  
P =>   Excellent value for money As a frequent traveller to Dubai  it is extremly refreshing to be able to stay at a hotel offering value for money I recently spent   nights during Eid at the Express at the excellent rate of USD     all inclusive Beleive it or not with breakfast The hotel is brand new and is sparkling clean  Location is good for the beach and Emirates Mall Staff are friendly and drinks are resonably priced I strongly recommend this hotel for those on a limited budget I hope Dubai will offer more quality hotels at good value  
P =>   Warning This hotel is brand new and ideal for anybody doing business in new Dubai or Internet City   There is a hotel shuttle bus that is supposed to pick up from the airport every hour but please beware that it is disguised as an AVIS car hire bus   We gave up waiting for it when we arrived and caught a taxi   cost    dhms    When I saw the bus the next day I realised why we had missed it as it had a great big AVIS sign plastered on the side so we took it to be a car rental pick up bus when we saw it at the airport   There is a tiny holiday inn sign at the front of the bus that you might spot if you have a keen eye  There are no shops or sights nearby so you need to get a taxi everywhere  The mall of the Emirates is about a ten minute taxi ride   There is a shuttle bus that runs to Jumeriah Beach Park at    every morning   we used this and then got a taxi into town   Might be worth hiring a car if you are staying so you do as you please   If not you will have to take a taxi everywhere  Hotel is spotless   it s just not for tourists   
P =>  excellent hotel  conomique  
P =>  H tel propre fonctionnel top resto en haut  
P =>   Ottima esperienza Holiday Inn Express Dubai   Media City  
P =>  Bello     
P => 
P =>   Very good Very good stay and as expected like any other good holiday inn express  The breakfast is complimentary and the fitness centre is open   hrs  The only downside was the internet access  they charge you a flat   aed for  hour  so if you want to check your email it s still   aed for a few minutes  Everyone nowadays need internet access when on the go  I think holday inn need to re think their policy on internet usage  
P =>   The best  We travelled with a family of   and an elderly woman  Wonderful hotel  brilliantly friendly staff   especially Mohammed at the reception desk   we liked it more than the    hotel we also stayed at in Dubai   which shall remain nameless   Definitely worth going  the BEST FOOD you will have in a long time  
P =>   Value for Money This hotel is located better than the other two Holiday Inn Express hotels available now in Dubai  The hotel is very close to Shaikh Zayed Road  It is really a good value for money in Dubai  
P =>   They understand customers In the beginig I had bad surprise when I compared the very low rates of october      with the high rates that I have paid in advance  non refundable  when I did my reservation in march       I used to think that prepaid payment offers good prices  but not in Duba  this year  I had an awfull regret because it s not refundable and of course impossible to cancel and book again with the discount price But after a few phone calls and emails   I found an a agreement with the manager  a deal honest for me and for the hotel  It seems that it s hard time for the hotel business in Duba    So as an intercontinental group hotel  they have good customer service standart  Stay calm and polite with them  understand their point of view and they will understand yours 
P =>   excellent choice good location  withing short driving distance to most of attractions in Dubai  clean  nicely furnished rooms  and most importatntly very affordable price the only thing i didn t like about the hotel is the breakfast  which i found to be very poor  with with this excellent rate  breakfast is no big dealwill definitely recommend it 
P =>  excellent stay   star hotel with a   star personality  just got back from the holiday inn express safa park  i travelled with my mother and we stayed in a twin room  It was our first time in dubai and it was ramadan  we wanted to stay at a no frills hotel  We travel a lot and are always on tours and the beach  so we knew we wouldn t spend a great deal of time in our hotel  there is too much to do in Dubai Our room was modern as the hotel is only    months old  was immaculate clean with tea coffee facilities and a fridge  tv  Could not fault the room  excellent staff made us feel valued and special We had breakfast included which was just cereal juices fruit and toast  not a lot of selection but it wasn t a problem This hotel is only a   star but i feel like in england it could easilly pass as a   star  The place is next to safa park and Gulf news good landmark for taxi drivers For a        a night room rate including a breakfast with great staff in a good safe quiet location  free shuttle to the beach and Dubail mall you can t go wrong  Note that the shuttle leaves the hotel once at      am for Jumeriah beach park and at      am for Dubai mall However if a swimming pool is important to you there isn t one   If anyone would like any further information please don t hesitate to contact me  
P =>   Friendly clean and great location  Excellent value for money  Stayed here for a few days business and found it conveniently located between the beach  Dubai Mall  the Creek and the ina  Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful  rooms clean and modern  Only minor complaint is that the breakfast is very basic  
P =>   Ok business hotel The rooms are not great but functional  It feels like a budget hotel so expect that standard  However  in my view its the best burger in town or perhaps I was hungry that night  Fitness facilities limited and breakfast is ok and included in the price No room service Internet though is fast and reliable which is a big help  
P =>   Clean and Good Value Typical Holiday Inn set up for Business travellers  Rooms are clean and well equiped with all amenities but the extra toiletries are not there  The shower taps are hard to work out  Good breakfasts  Very helpful and friendly staff  Free shuttle buses to the Dubai Mall and the beach are a bonus  There are no restaurants around and nothing much else so you need to take a taxi everywhere  The restaurant in the hotel has a limited menu and the food is just passable  There is a good gym on the top floor Dubai Mall is amazing and we most enjoyed the old part of Dubai  Good value 
P =>   Great value and service   would definitely recommend    Lovely and very helpful staff  very nice rooms  very clean  we were so impressed  great value  location pretty good  stay here you won t regret it       
P =>  The Best Budget Hotel in Dubai I really liked the hotel It s new just opened       very clean and nice decorated Everything you need for a budget hotel The bathroom is clean  room is standard decoration  and it s clean There is a car parking in the basement The only disadvantage is the internet is too expensive      per day  
P =>  Cool hotel I spent a week here on my own and found it to be an excellent buisness hotel This isn t a hotel you would plan to spend much time at but when you are there it provides excellent service Breakfast is a continental buffet  no more  no less  It was constantly replenished with croissants  cheese   meat  fruit etc Lunch and dinner is available from a limited but tasty menu and the service is great  The lounge and bar is spacious and comfortable and the staff at reception were very cheerful and helpful  In fact  all the staff I had contact with were very nice This is a new and modern hotel  The rooms had everythng I needed and were clean and very comfortable  Laundry service was very good too The gym is small but very nice  Cycle  cross trainer    treadmills  weights  tv and water cooler  My one problem was the aircon  My room was so cold  I turned the AC off for   days with no change  So my advice is to bring a sweater Location is such that you have to get a taxi everywhere  This was the biggest problem I had  This is a hotel to sleep in and grab a quick bite to eat at  As a base for a holiday  the lack of pool and outdoor space  means you need to leave the hotel everyday   often twice or three times  Due to it s location   you need to take a taxi everytime  if you want to go shopping or go to the beach park or anywhere  They may be cheap but it does become a drag   Long waiting times  refusing to take you  taking longer routes  expecting large tips  These things occurred half the time while other drivers were very good   but it can become very annoying  As it s fairly new  a lot of drivers don t know it but it helps to mention  quot Gulf News quot  which is next door  An ATM  cafe and mini mart can be found in the building directly opposite the hotel entrance  
P =>   Perfect as a base to explore Dubai We enjoyed our two night stay in the Holiday Inn during a stop over on the way to Malaysia  It is a good  basic hotel with some added extras  The reception area is big  clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful  The rooms were well equipped and had everything you would need for a couple of nights  Although the hotel isnt in the middle of the main areas of Dubai  it is a good base to explore from if you dont want to spend your time at the pool  it doesnt have one   If  however  you want to pay a very reasonable price and save your money for shopping  eating out and visting the other hotels  using their facilities  for example we visited Aquadventure at the Atalantis  without paying their prices  this is up your street  
P =>   New and reasonably priced on Sheikh Zayed Rd  I have booked this hotel through www asiatravel com which gave me a higher rate than what the hotel receptionist offered on arrival at the hotel door  However  the stay was pleasant  The room was tidy and clean a bit more on the smaller size to what I expected  outdoor and indoor parking was available and complimentary The complimentary breakfast is a joke  Basically cornflakes    types of juice  toast and coffee  However  for a business traveler perhaps that is more than enough as one of the staff in the hotel said I used the gym right after breakfast  After warming up  the house keeping guy came in the gym room and started cleaning  Vacuums  sprays  sweeping the floor and what not  No courtesy to the alone athlete trying to do his morning exercise Finally the hotel offers wired high speed internet connection which was very expensive  Not only that  but also if you accidentally close your internet browser  no mercy  you pay full price again for re connecting  So if you ever need the internet in Holiday Inn Express Safa Park  please make sure you have your laptop and internet explorer screen open all the time before you pay dearly Overall  good   star hotel which business oriented  
P => 
P => Cheap and cheerful   very nice staff The hotel is in a good location for downtown Deira  but many taxi drivers have not heard of it because it is small  The rooms are small but clean  The breakfast buffet is a limited choice but it is okay and changes daily  The metro station to the other side of the creek  Bur Dubai  is only   minutes walk   the Rigga road  
P =>  Great little hotel I stayed for two nights in ober    with my wife and four children  Found the reception and concierge to be very friendly and helpful to my family  Of the   of us only my wife could hear the disco when we were on the  rd floor  They moved us to a higher floor away from the discos without any problem next day  Other staff in restaurant were friendly also  Looks as though a lot of Russians stay here and so some of the staff are Russian speakers only The free shuttles to airport  beach and markets are great especially for a large family  The hotel was good value compared with others we looked at in Dubai  Depending on why you are visiting the hotel is in a good spot for sight seeing and shops  If you want to go to the beach every day you are probably better going to a new resort area as Deira can get clogged up with traffic and it may take a while to get there There are no fridges in rooms but there is a shop across the road to buy cool drinks and snacks  The hotel has   lifts  not one  The decor is old but I found it refreshing  sort of old European with thick wooden doors  plush carpet and low lighting  rather than the sterile chain hotel decor where every room looks the same  The rooms are clean and quiet and if you get a room on the corner of a floor they are a lot bigger The most lasting memory are the friendly staff  If you decide to stay here and have any problem make sure you talk to Yusuf the concierge  he will help you out  
P =>   Love Dubai This is really nice hotel  close to the airport  Stayed there already several times  when passing through Dubai  It allows    h check in  which is great  cause my plane arrived   am and needed early check in without extra charge  Its close by to great restaurants and malls  Dubai is fantastic  
P => You get what you pay for This is a budget hotel  and that s what you get  The reception staff are unhelpful  if polite with it  The rooms are very small  but not dirty  not sparkling either   The AC works  which is good  but no mini bar  kettle  safe or anything like that  There is a swimming pool on the roof about     x     but it s not a particularly relaxing place to be as the AC units are also up there  chugging away manfully  There are two nightclubs in the hotel but I have to say we never heard anything from them  Like a lot of hotels in Dubai right now  the Eureka is in the middle of a construction site  One night we had a delivery of cement going on until  am outside our window  If you re a light sleeper I would give it a miss until y or so  maybe a lot of the work will be done by then  Another reason to avoid it at the moment is the amount of disruption to the Rigga Road  they re digging it up for some reason and it can take a while to get to and from the place  
P =>   We Liked It I was staying in Hotel Eureka with my husband last il for   nights   i liked the hotel   it s clean and quite although the room and bathroom are small   but we don t need a bigger one   coz we don t stay at the hotel much   we use it for a late nigt sleep after having a lot of fun in Dubai   or we use the bathroom as well for a quick night and morning shower   i liked the hotel and it s worth the money we paid  it s a cheap price hotel but it s clean not like other   stars hotels which is too bad   this was a good one comparing to other and i recommend anyone who want to pay less and get a good hotel for a sleep to book this hotel   i will go back to it again if i visit Dubai    thanks 
P =>  Real value for money   The second time I have stayed at this cozy Hotel with a family touch and I must say it gets better every time  Currently under reconstruction  the Hotel is being upgraded and shall soon get a new management Clean  comfortable rooms well above the average   star standard of Dubai with a very accommodating and friendly staff to boot  The location near the busy Deira commercial district is another plus for anyone travelling on business The food served is also quite good and definitely worth the price charged for it There is a nice rooftop pool  which shall soon be fitted with a Sky BAR under a huge canopy  There are two clubs  one Indian and one Arab themed  which soon will also be refurbished At less than    Euro per night including buffet breakfast adefinite bargain  
P =>  Great Budget Hotel I had to find a last minute inexpensive hotel for   night and found this hotel through Travelocity  After staying in other   star hotels in Dubai this was a change  It is a good deal and the staff is helpfull and professional  It is very small and if they would use some bleach in the bathroom to get rid of the mold I would have given it higher marks  Overall  I would recommend it for budget travelers  The room service is good  It appears they cater to a lot of Russian travelers  I will return  
P =>  Good Me and my family stayed at Eureka hotel in         I had stayed here before for a night in      so I knew the standards and what to expect  From the moment we arrived  we were welcomed warmly and rooms given to us promptly  We stayed for a week and can quite safely say that we all enjoyed it really well   Pool may not be Olympic size but was clean and private  The gym was rather lacking though and a bit bare  Rooms clean and tidy  Space was limited but not too much trouble after a liltle organising of clothes and luggage  Bathroom was clean  however  was a little rusty around the bath handles At night  the in house Indian club can be a little loud and floors      amp    definitely heard a thump of bass till  am in the morning  so I suggest if you decide to stay here  try and get yourself higher than these floors The staff became really good friends with us and always loved a chat when we came in and out from the hotel to the extent that I was even given a telephone number from the Car Park attendant to call him anytime the next time we came to stay in Dubai Breakfast Bar   basic but enough to fill you up in a morning Location  Literally  mins from the Airport after timing myself  Close to the Clock Roundabout  Also is a  min walk from Al Riqqa Road  which was known as  The Place to be   when Dubai began developing  Tonnes of restaurants and coffee shops down one side and shops down the other  Fantastic at night  though can be very busy with traffic at night  Next to the hotel is mini market so dirt cheap food  snacks  toiletries  pots and pans anything and everything  Next to that is the Dry Cleaners and a  min walk down the street will lead you to a post office  so great for sending post cards Overall  we had a really nice time and if you re not expecting too much from a  Star hotel and on a budget then this place is recommended   Also a very important note  On Wednesday   st        the hotel was under new management who are expected to give the hotel a brush over A great to place to eat is a breakfast bar called B B that s open   hours on Al Riqqa Road   great coffee  huge variety of takeaway food and exquisite range of fresh fruit juices  
P => Clean budget hotel   don t expect any frills I have to say this was an above average hotel considering the dirt cheap rate we paid for twin share  The reception staff were not particularly helpful  we managed to get away with giving them only a photocopy of our passports   but the room was clean and pretty spacious  Watch out for the bad shower curtain though which leaves a flood on the bathroom floor The food available in the restaurant  very basic  downstairs was fine and pretty cheap  Breakfast wasn t too bad  There is some noise from the street nightclub  but it wasn t excessive and we had earplugs anyway Overall  it s definitely a budget hotel which is good value if you re looking for something basic in a pretty central location  
P =>   Selective Welcoming Staff I took the advice of the hotel booth operator at the airport to stay at Eureka Hotel  My experience with the front desk receptionist  who is a Filipino girl who is there during the early a m  until afternooon  was horrible from the time I arrived until the time I left I booked for two nights and ended up staying a third night  When I came downstairs to extend  she suggested that I go back to the airport to reserve my additional night and wanted to charge me a much higher rate I got food poison from the breakfast and the toilets wouldn t flush properly   so you can imagine the smell   I can go on and on  but the bottom line is that I would have been better off staying in the streets than staying at Eureka Worst hotel I have ever experienced  
P =>  Cheap budget hotel This hotel is cheap budget hotel with i would rate as a   star and not a   star as stated when booked  Rooms were clean but the bathroom were terible and tiny however room was a reasonable size  It was also stated there would be a mini bar WHAT MINI BAR   also stated there was a gym and swimming pool WHICH WAS NEVER OPEN    Breakfast is terible  not worth getting out of bed unless you are happy with toast and jam  Room service was ok but prices were like staying in a five star hotel  I stayed for   nights and the music from the night club on the ground floor was very load and could be heared from the  th floor untill  am  recomend you ask for top floor if you stay  On average if you dont want to spend alot of money then this hotel will be in budget and is ok  Its what you pay for is that what you get  Would i stay in this hotel again NO    I have visited Dubai again and i really suggest you stay in the Lotus hotel around the corner  This hotel was great and it lived up for its   stars    
P =>   Naja  
P =>  Ein Klasse Hotel f r den schmalen Geldbeutel  
P => 
P =>   everything is ok except I was in Hyatt regency galleria on    ember and everything is ok except   Slow dialup connection with expensive rate  bad location with traffic jam 
P =>   Out of the way but a modern and high end Great breakfast  clean rooms  everything was well designed in the modern  minimalist style  The lobby area is sophisticated  and the staff was very pleasant Only comment is about the location   because it s out of the way  I wouldn t recommend this hotel to people who are new to Dubai  coming here for a short stay  or don t know anyone in the city because you ll be driving a long time  and in traffic   for anywhere you want to go in Dubai Dubai is a city with a great hotel culture  and its seems that every hotel wants to out do the others in size  design and services  Hyatt Regency is understated  doesn t flaunt its ambiance  doesn t get caught up in the glitz  and remains a reliable place to stay  
P =>   It was great I truely enjoyed staying at this hotel  The staff was great  The rooms were clean  The service was great  We arrived at the hotel late after trying to find another hotel when all others were booked  The staff exetended out check out time to   pm instead of   pm free or charge  I loved the fact the they have a full service spa and salon in the hotel  as well as a ice skating ring  night club  and mini mall  We had a great veiw on the   th floor  The only thing I found a little odd was how the salon was set up  My husband and I wanted to get in the hot tub  but there was no co ed  On for the men and one for the ladies  It was still very nice  They had to hot tubs  a steam room  and a sauna  Very peaceful and relaxing  
P =>  Choose a hotel on Jumieira beach location Hotel was fairly good  not in that great a location  about    min drive to beach  The swimming pool was rather small  and poolside bar needed a more varied menu  The kitchen restaurant buffet food wasnt that great  preferred the coffee bar   For a fraction of the price  Hotel offered an ice skating rink which was a good price  You need to get a taxi everywhere and the traffic is quite bad  it is where all the locals work  If you are visiting Dubai go to Jumieira beach end the hotels all have own private beaches and plenty of restaurants with shuffle buses to a lot of place  I recommend the Hilton Dubai Jumieira Shuffle buses from the Hyatt were VERY limited  once a day and only go to city centre or beach at not very good times  
P =>  Good location Very helpful hotel staff  A good and reliable Hyatt Regency  Definitely would consider it again  
P =>  An absolute Hyatt Touch  Food Location  The location of the hotel and the sophisticated Hyatt touch into the minute details in the making makes this my preferred hotel in Dubai  I have been frequenting this hotel since      and due to the proximity to the Deira Gold Souq  a    minutes walk  makes this a very comfortable to work with  The three restaurants  FOCACCIA for Italian food  KITCHEN for Continental and an Iranian restaurants besides the independent sleek bar offers cuisine of highly exceptional quality  Focaccia Restaurant perhaps is the best Italian restaurant I have ever visited on the planet earth  Kitchen Restaurant offers good quality breakfast besides quality continental food  The utensils  cutlery and the accessories used are extremely classy and elegant with marked difference in comparison  The hotel has world class Spa and Health Club on level   offering usual health club facilities but in style along with tennis courts  heated but open swimming pool  Jacuzzi  steam  massage etc  The pool location is mind boggling facing the sea with huge area offering a pool side bar restaurant  The service standard and the courtesy level are superior and easily noticeable I highly recommend this hotel in Dubai either for business or pleasure  
P =>  A definate must to stay We were treated like king and queen here  Everything was available at your finger tip including an amazing gym and pool area Please take our word for it  this is one hotel you can t say NO to      
P =>   Truly memorable service The people make the hotel  I ve stayed at all three Hyatt s in Dubai and this is certainly the best for business  Park Hyatt for a romantic break  and if you can push the budget you MUST get a club room  The Club Lounge on   th floor is staffed by a truly great team who greet you like very special friends  
P =>  Clean and Friendly but a little out of the way and like most of Dubai expensive  After a short trip     mins  from airport  we arrived in the early hours to be met by some friendly reception staff who quickly sorted our room  We decided to upgrade to the executive level      per night extra   This actually proved to be a good investment as it gave us access to the executive lounge where we had free soft drinks and snacks all day  free internet access and free alcohol and a light buffet from   till   in the evening The room was a good size with good views over the sea front though the base of the Deira Palm is in full view  All work has stopped due to the economic crisis   The beds were large and comfortable  The Bathroom  which had a seperate bath and shower  was clean and well stocked with toiletries  A free local English language newspaper was delivered each morning Breakfast was very good with a large selection of hot and cold fare  Again the staff  definately the hotels strong point   were very helpful always smiling  ready to top up your cup almost before it was empty  The local taxis are excellent value but beware of the private  None Yellow  ones as they are very expensive and can be double the fare of a Local one  
P =>   Hyatt Dubai Great place to stay  If travelling with family  I suggest to take a   bedroom apartment called Galleria Apartments  One can enjoy the Ice skating and the night club located at the ground floor 
P =>  It s a Hyatt  In most other cities in the world  this would probably rank higher than it s current position on trip advisor  but being in Dubai it probably isn t surprising that it has been overlooked  Okay so it isn t as imposing as its sister hotel the Grand Hyatt  nor is it as chic as the park hyatt  but if you re in Dubai and want quality accomodation  great service and a convenient location  at a price that is still reasonable  then the Hyatt regency deserves a look  Rooms are clean large modern  and offer great views  The restaurants were all good  the revolving restaurant on top of the hotel is great for buffet dinners with friends  and wiling away evenings  The hotel is probably more of a business hotel than one for tourists  but is very conveniently located for getting around Dubai  Staff were professional  and upon checkout I didn t feel like I had a gun in back when handing over my credit card  
P =>  Cooler than outside Dubai is a strange place to visit and this was my fourth visit over the last fifteen years  This Hyatt of the range available in Dubai is at the mid level price range for this up market chain  Most hotels in Dubai are in general overpriced and this is no exception  This is not a tourist hotel but is well occupied with business men mostly from India and Pakistan and Europe The hotel is Westernized as is most commercial space in the Dubai emirate  The standard is high and the eating places are varied and never busy  The mezzanine bar is attractive and sells both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks  In a reverse of most countries and in keeping with the Islamic arab tradition non alcoholic drinks are the more expensive option and to my palate taste a lot better than cheap watery Indian beer I dined in three of the restaurants  italian  the ground floor bistro and the rotating main restaurant on the roof  The former two are not to bad and acceptably priced the latter is for the guest to pay for  The roof rotation is very gentle and mildly entertaining  The Dubai tower is quite a picture at night  The food in this high cost option is average and unfortunately served as a buffet  The choice is wide but to be frank the cost is excessive  While our party dined there was a dreadful noise from an attached disco nightclub  Obviously these would be very rare in an Arab country as women are not allowed out so most in attendance presumably were visitors staying in the hotel  The music was way too loud as were some of the visitors  I was not sure what the managers wanted to achieve here  either diners take precedence and reasonable quiet is required to allow speech or they are making a break with local cultural norms and want to party  Either is of course fine but make your mind up chaps Rooms in this hotel are pretty much the standard one would expect  They cost a lot and they are fully up to the charging  The hotel is isolated and walking outside even at night is far too hot in all but the winter months  I made a mistake of walking around a mile in the late afternoon and ruined a suit with sweat  The gym is good but very busy until mid evening  
P =>   Old Dubai hotel In the city of the thousands of hype hotel  the Hyatt Regency looks very old  Build before the Dubai boom it is the the  quot old quot  part of the city  at least half an hour drive from every point of interest  if any  in Dubai  i e  shopping malls   small room  although clean   only   elevators for a full hotel     floors  ends up in long waiting times in the elevator bank  A very small swiming pool  in a city where temperatures reach more than    C  in summer  and an old gym  As far as service is concerned be aware that they will try everything they can to up sell you  club    Another thing  becaus ethe hotel is far from the shooping malls ect   you will have to wait long time to get a cab  you may be bound to order an hotel limousine  
P =>  Would Gladly Return A fine hotel offering good value for money in Dubai  It s not glitzy  But everything works well  The health club is excellent  The pool was pleasantly warm in the winter  not always the case in     hotels in the Gulf   The staff were extraordinarily welcoming  The Club Floor offers good value    for the additional cost  one get airport transfers  breakfast  internet  in the Club lounge   and cocktails  This is a functional hotel that functions well  It s not a glamor spot  Not one of the flashy new places in Dubai  But it s a great place to stay and relax and from which to venure  
P =>   Absolutely brilliant   My sister and I had the most amazing stay at the hotel  The staff were incredibly helpful and nothing was too much trouble  We found the room to be ideal  it was quiet and clean  I would absolutely stay there again if I m ever lucky enough  
P =>   beautiful hotel but    We stayed at the Regency for   nights The hotel is located near the old part of the city  What is nice about it is that is renovated and the staff is very helpful  The rooms are big and of course clean We had a lot of requests and everyone was welcome to help us at any time The swimming pool area is not impressive but the bar is ok The japanese restaurant Miyako was excellent and one of the best in the city  Also i recommend the Al Dawaar the revolving restaurant but go during the night time the views are beautiful The only problem that we had was that you have to wait in line for a taxi and it might take a while to get one And sometimes the taxis don t want to take you back to the hotel because of traffic  so here is a tip you can write down the car plates and he can have some serious problems If you decide to take the black lexus in front of the hotel make sure to ask the price before you get it  
P =>  Loved The Regency We Arrived early morning and were delighted to be given our room key immediately  Our room had a beautiful view of the Creek and pool area  The sun rises and shines on the pool area until about  pm then the area becomes fully shaded  Hotel supplied unlimited bottled water free of charge  Mini Bar was not electronic which meant we could use it to keep our water chilled in it  Hotelopia supplied a wonderful price   nights was just under      and this included full Buffet Breakfast each morning     minutes walk from the hotel is the wonderful Gold Souk and many more attraction areas  We discovered the best way to sight see was by Air Conditioned Taxi  they are extremely cheap and drop you door to door  The Big Bus tour is not recommended  The only down fall within the hotel is the Guest Relations Department  every question they were asked they had to phone for an answer  Make sure you use the registered taxis and not the private ones who the doormen at the hotel know  This is a great hotel in a fab location  should I visit Dubai again without Doubt I will stay in the Regency  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel A fantastic hotel  Excellent service  excellent food  amp  excellent rooms  I stayed there for a conference and couldn t find any fault at all with the hotel  Will definitely stay there again  
P =>  Great Great Great This hotel made our holiday five star   The staff are so friendly and helpful and you do not want for anything  They will even go and check what the weather is going to be like if you ask them  The hotel is amazing and the rooms are excellent quality and were cleaned twice a day if you did not put your do not disturb sign on  We had an early morning flight but checking in was no problem and our room was avaliable straight away  Due to all the construction in dubai  you will alway have a crane for your view but we also had the mouth of dubai creek and the skyline was amazing at night  Best of all was the food  The hotel has   different restuarants  the best being the revolving one on the   st floor  with a fantastic buffet offering you food from all over the world  but I also enjoyed another resturant called the Kitchen  I would also recommend the Spa for a massage as it really relaxes you  The only disadvantage is that you cannot lay by the pool later than  pm but they cater for that by having a sun deck  which is just as good  you can order your drinks and food by the phone nad they will bring this to you as well Location wise we found this perfect     min walk from the gold souk and everywhere else is no longer than a    min taxi  and taxis are very cheap  The bar was very busy when we stayed but i am already looking to stay here again next year    
P =>   Great hotel in walking distance to the souks We stayed for   nights in a Regency Club room  All hotels in Dubai are expensive   and given that you can only drink in a hotel bar  this was a good option  as evening drinks were included  The lounge included supper  breakfast    pcs with internet connection  newspapers etc Check in was very smooth and quick  and staff were always very attentive  The room was big and well equipped with a good view  A negative was an annoying glass panel which allowed light from the bathroom into the bedroom The hotel is within walking distance from the gold souk  creek  old city etc  
P =>   Great Hotel   Not so great location After arriving at the hotel at     am off an   hour flight It was such a relief to be checked in an shown to our rooms with no fuss about the early check in time  I found the rooms very spacious and clean with views over the ocean in the distance   one of our rooms overlooked the building site of one of the palm islands which was interesting to see   there was no noise from that  I realise that this is primarily a business hotel and not a resort type of hotel  the location is within walking distance  a fair way  of the creek and the gold souks   taking a taxi from the hotel towards the Madinat etc is very frustrating and time consuming as the traffic in the vicinity of the hotel is very slow and heavy  The shopping centre attached to the hotel is not worth a visit   there is an ice rink in the centre  but when we took a walk around there was no one using it and the shops were very basic in comparison to all the other very impressive malls in Dubai  The business centre is efficient and the breakfast choice was quite wide  In general the staff were helpfull and eager to please  
P =>   Excellent   The hotel  room  service  food  everything was absolutely great    I would definetely go back  The location is also very good  is close to all main tourist places  
P =>  Good and Bad This hotel had some really good points   excellent checkin  nice room  helpful staff and some really bad points   booked a package including breakfasts   charged for them  dont bother with the revolving restruant expensive and very ordinary  Pool area is not good have much better at home This is not a hotel for the holidaying family but it is a convenient base for a short stay   close to airport  shuttle to nearby mall  good tour desk   i recommend the desert safari one of the best things we did in Dubai and close to the gold souk and then a ride accross the creek  
P =>  Nice hotel but don t stay there if you are on holiday  Nice rooms but    I was there in   there was no sun at the swimming pool after   or  pm  as it is hidden behind the hotel building  The bar is beautiful but empty and REALLY boring   Would go back if I was on business  will definitely not go back there for holidays    
P =>   Good price   fantastic hotel View of persian gulf fantastic  Great room     qualtiy but as I was in summer I got a great price  Location is fine but in summer it was a bit hot for me to walk any distance  As you would expect Hotel ammenities were great and service excellent  Hotel efficiently arranged several trips for me  
P =>   For business travellers only  Well you wont find a cheaper   star hotel in dubai thats for sure  however the hotel is poorly located unless you have you re own car  want to take taxis everywhere you go or are just here for buisness meetings  in which case it s perfect Good points   The rooms are great  lots of space  comfy bed  large tv with a good choice of tv channels  air con here is great  The mainhotel is very stylish and a good place to people watch Bad points   The fresh fruit in my room however was rotten  the hotelseems to sneakily put     on top of everyhting they charge  even the hotel room  so be careful and read the fine print  Also  if you re onmore of a budget there is a small and extrremley cheap well stocked supermarket attached to the hotel complex  a can of coke here will cost you   durrahms compared with    from the mini bar  so makes sense to nip down there and stock up for you re stay  There is also asmall bakery nearby  this is great for a cheap breakfast as well  i had their  bread basket  including croisants etc on the first night and this was of very poor quality not to mention expensive  i would give this   stars and a half stars if i could  This is my second staybut i think i will choose an alternative for my next stay  
P =>   Top Class Hotel with service to match We originally booked another hotel in Dubai but changed following TA reviewers advised that it had been surrounded by building works This resulted in more TA research and the decision to book the Hyatt and a Club floor room which included an Airport pickup and other access to club floor lounge  We were not disappointed one bit  in true Hyatt style this hotel delivers the goods in all respects  Whilst some reviewers have found its location out of the way  for us it was perfect as it provided great view over the Gulf back to the City from our room  It is easy    minute walking distance to the Gold Souk     minutes to Fish Souk and    minutes to wharf area where you can take a relaxing tour of the creek on one of the many small boats waiting The Club Floor provides great value and the service provided by the attentive staff is the best that we have ever experienced and enjoyed in any Hotel in the world In a city that has a Grand Hyatt and a Park Hyatt as well ensures that the Hyatt Regency staff look after you well so that you don t get tempted to stray on your next visit  Eating options are many and good quality  we ate at the Italian Focaccia one night and had a good meal with service and ambiance to match  We also recommend the revolving restaurant on the   th floor which serves a good buffet and views of Dubai  The bar is also an enjoyable place to have a quiet drink and enjoy a great view over the gulf Overall we could not fault the Hyatt and if your budget allows pay a bit extra and enjoy the benefits of the Club Floor Room  
P =>  Superb Hotel Despite Traffic Snarls I booked my stay through Emirates Airlines  There is much that is outstanding about the hotel  The room was huge  luxurious wiht a beautiful view of Dubai and the water nearby  The food was excellent and the coffees and hot chocolates to die for  Service at The Kitchen Restaurant was exceptional  The breakfast buffet in The Kitchen Restaurant  which was included in the room  rate was ample  After having breakfast  I was rarely hungry before   PM and then I only needed a light snack  As a result  I didn t get to try the revolving restaurant on the top floor for which this hotel is noted  Service was good and the staff did their best to help me with some snags regarding changing my return reservation Adjoining the hotel is a small shopping centre which includes a disco and  believe it or not  an ice skating rink  The hotel staff did not tell me but I discovered a coffee shop upstairs where you could pick up your e mail at a fraction of the cost of the hotel business centre  There is also a bank downstairs and money changing facility upstairs where you can get a more favourable exchange rate for your money than the hotel offers You can book desert safaris  not to be missed  and other tours at the hotel and a shuttle will come to pick you up The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of some important historical sites  Nearby  you will find the gold souk and the Heritage Village which includes the Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum s House  one of the oldest in Dubai and an example of traditional Dubai architecture  Unfortunately  due to the traffic pattern and underpasses  it can take         minutes to walk over there  Save it for a pleasant stroll in the cool of the evening  In fact the traffic was the only drawback to this location  I realize that Dubai has grown very rapidly and is undergoing a construction boom  It will take time for the transportation system to catch up  Shopping is not nearby so you wil have to take a taxi  I was there during the uary shopping month and the wait for taxis was LONG at times  If shopping is a major interest  you may want to stay at a beach location close to the Mall of the Emirates  where there is even believe it or not an indoor ski hill  for   or   nights for easier access  Most of the beach hotels offer regular shuttles to the mall so this will make shopping easier and give you a chance to unwind at the beach before you fly home One thing that is unique about this hotel is that you can take a    minute stroll to a local  really mult cultural community  sample cuisine from around the world  including Ethiopian  and see the diversity that is beginning to unfold in this city  It s a side of Dubai you may not see if you stay in other areas  Other than the taxi situation and the distance from some of the major shopping malls  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => All round winner  There is some confusion on this website   we stayed at the Hyatt Regency not the Grand Hyatt  which is on the pictures   We had an excellent holiday at the Hyatt Regency as it is a very well run hotel  plenty of staff who are friendly and helpful  The pool area was nice  some overhead plane noise  but generally uncrowded and safe for children too  Breakfast was really good with lots of choice and variety   I especially liked the freshly squeezed juices  about    varieties    The rooms were spotless and the bathroom decor was very modern and everywhere was clean  The revolving restaurant on the top floor is a must  as the views and food are fab   although watch out as it does become quite expensive  We also tried the Iranian restaurant which is also superb  I recommend finishing the meal off with a sheesha pipe by the live music  Great  Overall a really excellent hotel  The location is not bad  although we generally had to get a taxi to most places so that can mount up  I would definitely return to this hotel as I definitely recommend it  
P =>   Luxury all the way I travelled to Dubai for    days with my husband for a relaxing break from   th ch to   st ch  Having only decided to travel at the last minute decided to stick with the Hyatt brand as we had stayed in the Grand Hyatt last year for   nights  This hotel is in a central area and overlooks the persian gulf with fantastic views of the city  We had booked an executive room and were picked up at the airport by the hotel  On arrival check in was quick and efficient  We originally got a room on the   th floor but after   days we realised we both were disappointed with the size of the room as in the Grand Hyatt the rooms were much bigger  We arranged to upgrade to a suite for an additional charge and boy did we notice the difference in size  The rooms were much bigger and more luxurious and I would recommend it if it s within your budget  We were on the top floor      and the views were fantastic  All the usual facilities in the room with fresh fruit  plenty of water and Molton Brown bath amenities  The shower was very large in size and strong  Beds are extremely comfortable and we had both linens and robes changed daily The service in the hotel is excellent  In the lounge where you can have a buffet breakfast  nothing is too much trouble for them  In the evening over drinks they will chat to you if you wish or leave you alone if you want  They organised a couple of outings for us and certainly should be mentioned as a reason people would return to the hotel  Other services we used like laundry and room service were equally good and efficient We eat in the  quot kitchen restaurant quot  for breakfast most mornings where a hot buffet is provided with more variety  again very good service and choice We tried a number of the restaurants in the hotel  the Italian is excellent as is the Iranian restaurant   please try is as we seemed to be the only european visitors to it the evening we went but the food is brilliant and the live singers are also a nice distraction  Try the lamb chops We also eat in the Revolving restaurant on the   th floor on three evenings  It is fantastic value and brilliant food  the choices can not be described to you there were so many   it is a buffet meal and if you like large portions you can go fill your plate as many times as you like  Also very reasonable   only     per person The revolving takes about an hour so you see the whole city in it s glory   try to get a seat on the lower deck as you can see everything with nothing hindering your view  Our one negative about the hotel is the swimming pool  it is very small and goes into the shade from about  pm each day  you then need to move to the sun deck with no pool only a large shower if you want to stay sitting in the sun  There were always enough beds for everyone and the service again was excellent with regard to towels and drinks The gym is very big and spacious and has everything you could possibly need  we went every day as we like to work out and if you like this sort of thing it is perfect Shopping is very close to the hotel  short taxi ride or you can walk to the gold souk in    minutes  There is also a small shopping centre attached to the hotel with an ice skating rink  The Deira City Centre Shopping mall was the best one we found but beware of the long taxi queues when leaving  avoid the Thursday evening Friday as it is worse then This was our third visit to Dubai and it improves each time  We have found that the price of food and drink and taxis seems to be going down rather than up as we definitely found it cheaper this time around If you want pure luxury and an extremely large pool and facilities for kids then choose the Grand Hyatt but if you are looking for a relaxing break with excellent service and high quality food then choose the Regency Hyatt We will definitely go back  
P =>  What a transformation   There seems to be some confusion on the Tripadvisor web site  This review is about the older Hyatt Regency on the corniche   NOT the Hyatt Grand which seems to be shown in the pictures  I d stayed at the Regency on a few occsions in the past when weekending over from Muscat  When taking my wife and son back to Dubai in uary I d decided the hotel from past visits to be a little run down and out of date so booked into the Dusit instead  a mistake    However on taking my son to the ice skating rink at the Regency I was amazed at the transformation a makeover had made  So much so in fact that we booked to stay there   nights in ruary  What a fantastic change this hotel has gone through  This goes from the lobby  through to the relocated  and vastly improved bar  into the rooms  Staff were courteous and helpful at all times  Location of course is away from the  new  Dubai but easier to get to the airport  Pool as always is a bit square and goes into the shade in the afternoon  My wife says that on the plus side its only a walk away from the gold souk  Would be my hotel of choice   if I had t stayed at the Hyatt Grand leter in the week  
P =>  Excellent Stayed there for three days    I loved the views hotel     and especially the service l was provided by the waiters   it was at night and the were very proffessional  Well done Hyatt  l ll definely recommend everyone there  
P =>   Excellent hotel This hotel is perfectly located near the sea in the heart of Dubai with excellent views over Sharjah on east  Sheikh Zayed Road and Jumeirah Beach even to Burj Al Arab on West  Al Mamzar beach is located towards Sharjah and only   min away by taxi and the water is warm and clean  The staff of the hotel is very helpful to the point they even removed a family of noisy Russians with a small baby they kept waking me up  You go to sleep and wake up with an excellent view over the city if you ask the reception to put you in a west viewing room  One thing I must complain is the non metered taxi that operates outside the hotel and that charges double than a metered taxi  The hotel cannot take any action against this rude and nasty individual  so do take care and avoid non metered taxis  Appart from that all indians I spoke with  they all want to come to London and if you use some     taxis per day be nice to them  They will even tell you nasty stories that happened to these poor guys in Saudi Arabia Shopping is cheap in Dubai and lots of shopping centres  some show off and expensive some good value for money  Burj Al Arab is some    min away from the city and need to book well in advance a table and go there with your confirmation  however is packed with loud and show off English and Australians  
P => Wonderfull views We ate dinner at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Dubai at their revolving restaurant  The views are out of this world  The food is very good and is buffet style so you can eat as much as you like  The choice was excellent covering a range of hot and cold dishes with wonderfull desserts  Please try the American prime rib roast beef with the gravy it was the best we ever tasted and my husband had four helpings  
P =>   Good but be aware  We have just returnded from an   night stay and i hope i have provided here a fair review to help other travellers  The hotel is very nice  rooms are excellent  clean and spaceous  The reception area is an open souless place with none of the touches that make Dubai s   star hotels outstanding  this is our  th hotel in Dubai   The photo supplied by trip advisor above is the Grand Hyatt Dubai  so don t be misled  go on the hotel website for the photos We had some little niggles that the hotel could not  would not resolve  they put our    year old son at the opposite end of the corridor to us despite requests both  before and during the stay for rooms close together and the hotel was not full  We could not get a late check out beyond  pm our flight was at  am  A big draw back for us the pool only has sunlight until lunch time after that it s completely in the shade so no good for sun lovers or if you want a bit of sun after a day out  If you ve got kids the mini golf is    each  pitch and putt    each  tennis raquet hire        ice skating     not a lot but it does add up if you re on a budget  We ve stayed    before and these type of things are usually free The hotel is far out but you can get taxis cheaply and you are away from the major construction  the walk to the gold souk is along a very busy road not suitable for young kids Do not take the hotel shuttle bus to Mamzar beach it s awful   full of litter and you can t even buy shade  we went  paid to get in and came straight back  You can use the facilities at the Grand Hyatt  they have a beautiful pool set in gardens  definately worth a day out while you re there we have stayed there so know how good it is  The staff and service are good  rooms cleaned at least twice a day  We only ate in the  quot Kitchen quot  restaurant food was very good and not too expensive  This hotel is an average      we would not stay again only because we know there are better    hotels within this price range  We paid      per night for the double room and     for the single  booked through Hyatt com for the best rate  
P =>   Amazing  I have just got back from the Hyatt Regency after staying here for a week with my family  I had the most amazing time and the hotel is lovely  Yes there are quite a lot of businessmen but there are in many hotels in dubai  The reception staff are very efficient and helpful  we arrived early morning  not expecting to check in till   o clock but were alllowed straight into our rooms which was great after a long night flight  The club olympus includes everything from a gym to table tennis and squash  The pool is a decent size and there was always sunbeds  The sun deck also has plenty of beds  There are plebty of eateries and we dined twice at Al Dawaar  which i personally thought was lovely so ignore reviews  The gold souk is only about  dhs in a taxi and is a wonderful experience  You must bartar because they dropped a gold bracelet down from       to       Here you can get an abra across the creek and experience cheap shopping and lovely waterside restaurants  The boardwalk is also a must and includes great restaurants  Wild Wadi Waterpark is a must as they have flumes which actually go up instead of down which is definately different   Here you also get great views of jumeirah beach and the burj al arab  We went for a meal at the burj  must pre book  which was a once in a lifetime experience  it was beautiful  I would definately rather stay at the hyatt rather than jumeirah end as there is a lot of building work and not a lot to do within the area  Being close to the creek was a lot more enjoyable  I would go back tomorrow if i could  
P =>   First Class Hotel We have just returned from a   day trip to Dubai where we stayed at the Hyatt Regency  A lot of review sites said it was a great hotel but a poor location  I have to disagree   it is a fair way from the beaches and construction sites of Dubai but is in walking distance to the Gold and Spice souks and a short cab ride  which are cheap  to most of the old Town on both sides of the creek  The hotel was spotless  the staff very helpful and the rooms were spacious  clean and modern  I am fussy and we could not fault it The hotel has some of great restaurants including a    storey revolving restaurant serving buffet style food  fabulous Italian and the Kitchen   serving meals all day including a clay oven cooking The hotel was great value and the location although a fair way from the beaches offered easy access to most other areas by Cab  including    mins to the airport  
P =>  Wonderfully grand It was my first trip to Dubai so thought I d treat myself with a nice hotel and the Hyatt didn t let me down  It is a large and not very attractive building from the outside but when you enter the lobby you realise what s ahead  The check in staff were superb and noticed I had a late flight onto Colombo at the end of my stay so organised a late check out for me  The room was outstanding  plenty of space  huge bathroom  nice view out towards where they are building  The World   Used one of the hotel s eating places   there are plenty   and wish I d been told when I started that dessert was free with a main course as there was a table filled with all manner of chocolate dishes and a chocolate fountain where you could stand and help yourself  Very impressed and would stay again  especially if there was a special rate available  
P =>   Everything you expect from the Hyatt  After three weeks of travelling around the region I just wanted something comfortable to stay in for two nights before going back home  I was very pleased with the suggestion of the travel agency in the airport arrivals hall to stay at the Hyatt Regency   not to mention the excellent last minute deal they got for it  This hotel is a little further north than a lot of the newer ones  situated in the older part of dubai  But it is extremely close to the Gold Soukh  If you want to be close to the beaches and the newer Dubai ina area then this is not the place for you  But otherwise  this is a top quality hotel with everything you would expect from a five star establishment It is a very modern  contemporary design so I can see how the rooms seem a little sparse to some  It is nice that they actually thought to put a lot of extra outlets in the places you need them and the desk is actually condusive to doing work if you need to  We had dinner at the Iranian restaurant in the hotel and it was excellent  The live singing and band was a nice touch although a bit loud if you wanted to carry on a conversation  Sit out on the balcony and you can avoid some of the noise  Also very nice is the shisha  hookah  that is available here  Some of the best in Dubai   I am sure the brand new pipes help that And I can definitely say the service was wonderful  I forgot my cell phone on the table at dinner  Even though I immediately went back for it the restaurant had already closed  Fortunately  a cleaning person saw me and found a manager of another place that was open next door  This guy went out of his way to call the restaurant manager on his mobile and find out that my phone was with housekeeping  A very pleasant ending Overall  the Hyatt Regency is a classy hotel and I will definitely look forward to staying there again  
P =>  Rooms are great location is a little far out Stayed here for four days  We stayed on the newly refurbished fourth floor overlooking the pool which was very nice indeed  Bathroom was fantastic with a seperate shower and bath  The minibar was very very well stocked but be advised it will cost you more than your average minibar  If you feel like ordering booze from room service think carefully it will cost you a LOT of money TV shows quite a varied mix of channels and it was a definite bonus to be able to watch British news and see how the folks were freezing back home in the UK The pool is large and is heated in the winter and cooled in the summer  it s nice and deep too   down to     metres  During our stay the pool only had maybe one or two guests using it  unlike that facilities at the beachfront hotels further down the coast The revolving restaurant is worth a look but don t expect to be wowed by the cuisine  it s a buffet but it s not bad at all from a sustenance point of view The Iranian restaurant was very very good and with the live local music certainly gives you the flavour of Arabia  Recommended The staff were very pleasant without exception and were very helpful and attentive at every stage I think that the only real problem is the location  It s a bit far from the centre of town and the beach areas  however after saying that you have to remember that Dubai is not a pedestrians town  Taxis are cheap and plentiful  but often are complete lunatics and if you walk for   mins you will be at the top of the creek and with the local Gold souk within easy reach I particularly enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Regency  
P => Recently renovated comfortable My girlfriend  amp  I stayed here for one week  We were given a freshly renovated room with a view over the Gulf  and could not fault the room   large  amp  comfortable Breakfast served in the room was enough for   people The gym is decent  and the outdoor pool is fairly large  Tennis courts have a ball machine which is inexpensive to rent All the staff were friendly and helpful Internet access is indeed expensive  but we were able to pick up a  weak  signal from an open access point  and surf for free using that The hotel is slightly set away from the bustling shopping streets  You could walk to the gold souk and electronics district in about    mins  but a taxi is under    The hotel s nightclub is not as trendy as those in the nearby ine Beach Resort  so dress up a little and take a taxi there instead for cool bars and beautiful people  it s a short ride away I would be happy to stay here again  Shop around for prices  we paid US     with tax using prepurchased Hyatt vouchers  With lots to do  Dubai in general is a great place for a holiday  
P =>  Look elsewhere Cold  marble clad and one to be avoided Reception staff pleasant   and that s about it Definitely a business hotel  being near the gold souk doesn t make it  central  As for Al Dawaar  the revolving restaurant   save your money  
P =>  i cant fault this hotel   and i m picky

P =>   Good location with helpful staff Stayed in this hotel for    nights while a business trip The Manager was extremely helpful on arrival at the hotel due to mix up with the sister hotel at Mall of Emirates Hotel Staff were friendly and helpful with adequate dining facilities on site Room were basic but clean and well maintained  
P =>   If only Ibis hotels in Europe were like this  Stayed for two nights and was very grateful to be given a room at     am after a night flight  View from the room nothing great but good location on Sheikh Zayed Road   v covenient for Jumeirah and Mall of Emirates etc  Room was comfortable and clean  as you d expect from a new hotel  Bathroom small and some fittings a bit basic but otherwise vast improvement on all other Ibis I have stayed in  There was even an element of design  unlike the  quot posh youth hostel quot  feel of many of their European outlets  With two restaurants and a coffee shop bakery  dining options were also more than adequate  My only gripe was lack of hot water  Overall though  good value at DHS     Would like to see Ibis  and others  try this hard on their own patch  Expectations   and service levels   are clearly higher in this part of the world  
P =>   Great hotel for a budget conscious traveler  This hotel is mainly for business travelers  but I stayed there with my family  family of       small kids   and I do not have any complaints at all  Yes  the rooms are small  but I have seen some   star hotels with rooms smaller than these ones  Actually  they are very decent size rooms  even with   small kids I did not find there was a problem with space The service is EXCELLENT  very friendly and accommodating staff  If you request something  you get it within   minutes  The hotel is very very clean  maybe due to the fact that it is still new  but the staff is always walking around with dust cloths  wiping mirrors  dust bins  elevator buttons  etc If you have a car  you can park right in front of the hotel  no problem there at all The buffet breakfast was excellent  more than enough to choose from Bottom line   great choice for a budget conscious traveler  
P =>  Small remote decent small The rooms are really small  bathroom too and for      durhams  Free internet for  hours only  Free airport pickup in mpv  takes about    mins each way  ent continental breakfast provided eg  pastries  toast  eggs bacons  cold cuts  dairy stuff  etc   Hotel looks clean due to it being newly launched in il       Exterior area of hotel is a mess  but that s dubai  everything is under construction  About    to    mins walk to excellent Emirates mall  cab drivers usually grumble due to insufficient short distance fare  one way is about   to   durhams   This hotel should provide regular shuttle service to malls or popular spots  be it s still new or remote  located in service road off Sheik Zyed freeway   cabs need to be called in advance  sometimes a no show Bathrooms need a proper shower screen door     each shower floods the floor area  
P => 
P =>   WILL STAY THERE AGAIN We stayed in this Hotel for   nights  married couple  and i will do it again in the future Location is perfect rooms is clean and staff is very nice This Hotel is a bargain comparing with other Hotels It is still very new  the morning buffet breakfast is ok and is all one needs If i can make a recommendation it will be to place coffee tea making facilities in the room Taxis is available    hours and the nearest metro station is only    m away Just accross the street is the Deira City Cente Shopping Mall HEIN FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
P =>  Good value for money without the standard room provisions We booked this because it was brand new  right oppossite my favourite mall and very cheap  I found the room a bit small  but since just me and my best friend were going to share  that was not a problem  However the wardrobe is designed without a door  and there are no drawers in the room at all  we searched high and low  you dont get a mini bar  you dont get a hairdryer for your room  you dont get a iron or ironing board  the hairdryer i had to beg the staff for and they told me they were all being used  only when i shouted at the manager  was i provided with a new one which i then hid in my suitcase and only returned it when i left  iron and irnoning board we had to request from the porter each time we needed it  in the bathroom we only had two towels which was a bit of a nightmare   one bath size and one hand towel  and the bathroom toiletrrie  well it was all in one  hand wash body wash shampoo conditioner  all in one bottle  I am used to having all the above as i only ever stay at   or   star hotels  but since i travel so oftent o dubai  i settled for ibis  Oh  and there is no room service for food and drinks so if you need a cup of tea  you must carry it to your room yourself  as there are no tea making facilities in the room either  despite the lack of all BASIC ROOM PROVISIONS  i would stay here again  as its very clean  the staff is very nice and its cheap for people who want to be out shopping all day   bit of a shame though   wish ibis would provide all the basics  the next door accor hotel has all of the above and actually is not much dearer  
P =>  Average Brand new hotel  but very basic  seemed along way from anywhere 
P =>   NICE ENOUGH GOOD POINTS   Cheap for Dubai  clean  helpful staff  near the metro bus routes  near a mall  cheap food nearby BAD POINTS Poor breakfast choice  not a great location for sightseers  not suitable for anyone wanting to walk anywhere  small rooms DETAILSMy wife and I stayed here for   nights  it was one of the cheaper hotels but was acceptable for our needs  It is just   mins taxi ride from the airport and just across the road from a mall  Food and drink is expensive in UAE but the mall has a food hall with some great choices at good prices try the freshly cooked Italian food outlet I was not taken with Dubai and although I would recommend this hotel  I would not recommend staying in Dubai  It is just one large building site and unless you want to spend a lot of money there is not a lot to do  Shopping prices are the same as in the UK  The Metro is very good and cheap but has a limited coverage I would recommend getting a silver pass that allows you bus and metro travel combined  just keep topping it up as you need to  You can only pay at the metro or bus stations if you do not have a pass you can not jump on a bus and pay cash  When you get on the bus you swipe you card make sure that when you get off you swipe it again  ensure that it registers  or you will get a maximum fare deducted  
P =>   One of the Best Budget Hotels in Dubai This is a brand new hotel  Opened ember        so it s clean and shining The location is great  just across the street of Deira City Center  one of the major malls in Dubai   and it s just   minutes drive to Dubai airport The rooms are tiny  good for two people only Advantages   Good if you are looking for place to sleep only  Free car parking is availableDisadvantages   Internet is not free  There is no refrigerator in the room    No safe box in the room  No tea coffe making tray 
P =>  Nice Hotel Nice Location Had a stopover in Dubai for   days  If you are there on a short trip and a budget   search no more  Great Hotel for this purpose  Location   very good  close to hop on hop off bus stop and the mall  Rooms   small  but very comfy  Staff was helpful and polite  Our view from the window was great  And it was QUIET and CLEAN    There s a shuttle to Jameirah City Park Beach Minor grudges  all extras are to pay for   swimming pool at the adjacent otel  Internet   expensive  no wi fi  breakfast   not really great  but they want smth like     bucks for it  included in the room service   local phone calls are additional charge  
P =>   Great Location Room  Very basic  but clean room  Had everything you d expect but a safe  Standard basic  no frills room Rating         Staff  The staff was hit or miss  Some were great and very knowledgeable  whilst others had no idea about the simplest things  like what time the shuttle departed for the airport  and didn t know how to find out  Rating         Location  Only minutes from the airport  with the free shuttle  Literally across the street from the City Centre Mall  landmarks come in handy if you have a taxi driver that s only been on the job for a day  Only about a    minute taxi ride anywhere  Downside  if you want to lounge by the pool there isn t one  but you can pay a small fee  never inquired about the price  and go over to the otel  which is in the same complex only a minute away  Rating       
P =>   Very Basic at the Ibis Deira City Centre   dont expect much I suppose you get what you pay for  Its basic  clean and well serviced  However  its a long way from the hub of the city  Easy to get a taxi downtown but taxis didnt want to go back there  Took an hour to get a taxi to take me back  The hotel staff knew of this problem but didnt tell me  Only a few steps across to the mall    great supermarket  Good shopping over there  You have to pay to use the pool and gym equipment  which I thought was a rip off  Staff got snitchy when I wanted my pre paid breakfast at  am  I only wanted tea and toast as no tea makiing faciities in the room  kids were running up and down the corridor at     amI complained that kids were running up and down the corridor at     am  the staff just laughed and said that it happened all the time and they couldnt do anything about it  Very basic hotel  nothing flash at all  Ok if youre out all day  ps  you cant get a meal in the restaurant on a Friday night as its closed   so either go without or get something over at the  mall  The little cafe in the lobby is very expensive 
P =>  IBIS is good only for Sleeping HiI have stayed during my visit to GESS at Airport Expo in the month of ch   probably cooler in Dubai  Dubai as said is an expensive city   and to find a Hotel at USD     was understandable   But this Hotel is a TWO STAR Hotel in terms of service or you can say No frill hotel   You just need to go to sleep at the end of the day and its for the same   There is no entertainment in Room   TV Reception poor   Small Room and Very Small Bathroom   No Toiletries   nothing just one bath gel   You need to pick your luggage from the Pick up Bus  For me I was fortunate to find an Indian Guy who was actually a security but helped me  IBIS is near to otel  and is interconnected   Its Clean and No doubt about that   you can straight away go to City Centre which is walking distance from Hotel  Taxis are no easy available   and Hotel do not help on this  The only way is take a Hotel Cab which is going to cost atleast    Dhms and further if you get a Taxi its good  Its near to Airport around    Min   but Pick up faciltiy is too bad   I mean they have a shuttle and if you miss one then its not necesary the next will be half an hour only for me it took one hour from Airport to Hotel   waiting for the shuttle  But the Guy was good so he helped me finding something to eat etc  IBIS has nothing to offer you   Absolutely Nothing   Even Bar has nothing to eat  except beer and Break fast has no good menu   All the while it has been mixed kind for me  But if you are looking for Cost Effective   neat and safe place   Go for it   But do not go if you want to have a Good Services etc  Final Point the Card for Entering in the room has wrongly printed you need to use the opposite side of the Arrow   They would tell you this any ways Thanks Rohit 
P =>  Clean Tidy Helpful I would definantly stay here again I stayed at Ibis Deira City Centre in ch       I had a really good stay here  Reception people all spoke good english and were helpful  The rooms are very basic but are clean  To get a taxi from here was not a problem  they pull up outside the hotel regular or you can go acorss the road over to Deira City Centre and get a taxi from there There is also a free shuttle bus going to the airport every half an hour which was brilliant   they also provide a free shuttle bus to the beach as well  round trip  The only one problem I had was with the internet  I had paid for   hour of usage and only went on it for   minutes  I didnt have a pop up box saying to log off so I shut the computer down and let the receptionist know that its shut down and will that have logged me out of the internet usage  he assured me that it would have  Well surprise surprise  next time I went on the   hour usage had totally finished  I spent a good half an hour arguing with the IT man who didnt see the point I was making and that there was NO pop up box saying to log out  In the end the manager kindly said we could use the PCs around the back anytime during our stay    I dont know why they just didnt give us another card   
P =>  Clean Comfortable and Convenient  I liked the Ibis  The housekeeping staff were great  The staff at the desk were efficient but were easily distracted and could get a bit  quot uppity quot  when questioned The room was clean and comfortable  The bathroom was a bit cramped and I would have liked it if the Shower door was a double door so it could be shut while one is showering  Ibis is a no frills hotel but most things are supplied if one asks  I would have liked more options for TV viewing  The room was OK for a solo traveler but might be cramped for   people or a family  The view from my room was a bit voyeuristic as I was looking down onto the Swimming pool of The otel and all its swimmers        also at night the drapes have to come down or quite a number of otel guest would get quite a good show     The location is fantastic  Its easy to get a cab and one can also walk to the mall to get buses  Likes  I could walk out of the hotel and get tons of choices to eat form either around the hotel or at the mall and most are cheaper than the Hotel   Dislikes  Because its a no frills hotel  there wasn t a fridge or even a kettle in the room All in all it is nice hotel and I would stay there again  
P =>  More like a   star hotel  Very strange that this hotel is two stars as it felt more like a   star hotel  The location is perfect  next to one of the big shopping malls  and next to the otel Hotel  Free parking and most of the staff were helpful and friendly  The TV was not working and within minutes engineers were up to fix it  Modern hotel  clean rooms  near the creek  near the airport and I would definitely stay here again  You definitely would need a car though  but I think you need a car anywhere in Dubai as it s a big city and spread out like LA and other major cities  Not close to the beach but this is not a problem as the hotel offers shuttle services and if you have a car then it s fine  I d definitely go back to this hotel and recommend it to all  
P =>   Probably worst hotel of Asia trip The title says it all    amp  probably sums up Dubai too Spent a long time travelling around Asia  amp  to spend      on what is essentially worse than a UK Travelodge is an insult   and you dont even get tea  amp  coffee Staff on the reception are terrible   couldn t give a monkeys about  normal  travellers   when they were serving us  as soon as a  business client  arrived  they dropped everything  amp  served them   insulting Rooms are tiny  box like with no view form window  felt like a modern prison   i have stayed in better youth hostels Yes it is new   amp  functional   but not a nice place to stay for a holiday   or a honeymoon like us for   days  The bathroom is so small the door has to open outwards Water in the bar   rip off      for a big bottle   its actually more expensive than Petrol here So next time i went to Carrefour opposite  amp  got a bottle for   pence Food  amp  alcohol is very expensive like anywhere in ripoff Dubai Barstaff in Bar were very nice  amp  polite however We ended up eating in a locals street cafe  amp  had the best meal of our stay   for a fraction of the price Dubai is fine as long as you like building sites  construction  no natural beauty  ugly man made beaches  more character at gate  and expensive clothes  double the price of UK for designer stuff   whats the point  Some of the skyscrpaers are nice to look at  but thats all there is to look at We did afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab for a treat   that was nice   
P =>   Clean rooms Great Staff The rooms were simple but comfortable  No irons or hairdryers are included in the room but you can call housekeeping or the front desk for them  Clean rooms and new property  Great location in Dubai  We had a great time and were able to relax in the hotel as well  
P =>   Great Hotel Having done my research on hotels in Dubai it became apparent that you could easily spend a fortune on one of the many      places available  However  as my partner and I didn t want to break the bank and would rather spend the money on doing activities the Ibis Hotel seemed like a real bargain  We were not disappointed The place is brand spanking new and has the appearance of a      hotel  it is located around    mins from the Airport and there is a free shuttle bus  although this is not advertised anywhere when you arrive at the airport    ask someone when you arrive  a taxi is only around     so it s not a big deal   The room was exactly what you would expect for a new Ibis hotel  compact  clean and modern  It is located across the street from Deira City Mall which offers food  shopping and the starting point for the Red City Bus Tours  If your on a budget the location is excellet as you can waste some time in the Mall as there s not much else to do at night in the local area  The only downside to the Ibis Hotel in my view was the fact that you need to get taxi s everywhere from this location  but I would presume this is standard in Dubai due to the size of the city   One other minor gripe was the cost of everthing in Dubai  it is very expensive  except the taxi s   You could easily spend a fortune if you want to see the all the sites i e Big Red Bus Tour Ticket    persons          Atlantis Water Park    persons           Pint of Beer in Hotels        Glass on wine in Hotels         Meal for two in Hotel  No drinks            Hour on Internet         One other tip if you are staying in this location  take a left and first left when you leave the Ibis Hotel and there is a great Italian Restaurant which was very good  eating in the Mall can get somewhat tiring  Hope this helps  
P =>  worst staff ever i hope this dosnt sound petty but i was in shock id just travelled through south east asia and arrived at the hotel very late have booked and paid online with asiarooms  and apon arrival were told that they hadnt recieved payment and we would have to pay again  so we gave credit card details before going to bed and were told we couldnt have breakfast until this was sorted out  so next morning got up and bernd at the desk gave us a number to ring our bookin agent and only after alot of pushing did he make the call himself  we had one day in dubai and these bunch of morons ruined it  hotel itself is clean and modern couldnt fault the building but the staff were shocking  and on checking out i heard someone else in the exact same situation as us so obviously it happens alot  sorry if this sounds nasty but i was shocked 
P =>   Good hotel near City center shopping mall just a min walk Check in smoothly  good quiet room  bed is not that bad   breakfast i think its better to have a breakfast at the city center shipping center and location perfect but some times no taxis but you can cross to the shipping center to have one   if you get a car they have a good and big basement parking over all its good modren and nice  but i prefer to stay next time in the otel Deira City Centre its a   star hotel with the same location and better service 
P =>  loved it   my husband and i stayed at this hotel for   nights it is a very beautiful hotel brand new with free internet and shuttle bus to jumeirah beach the double room is simple u don t get much luxury but i think it is good for the price being a budget hotel and it is directly opposite the deira city centre mall where u can get free shuttle buses to mst parts of dubai Already planning anther trip to dubai 
P =>  Rapport Qualit  Prix imbattable

P => why can t all hotels be Ibis hotels  After being impressed with the World Trade Centre  Dubai  Ibis  we headed here once we d got our bearings  I think I m actually in love with Ibis  This place  and the WTC one  looks straight out of a glossy interiors mag yet costs so little it makes you blush  The staff were absolutely delightful and the  pork free  breakfast was excellent value too  Wasn t that impressed with dinner but after a   minute game of chicken you re at the Mall of the Emirates with Skiing et al  Internet was a bit pricey for those of us without a dongle but I feel ashamed to be complaining really  
P => Extremely good value   I stayed at this hotel for  nights last week  Its very good value at approx     per night and the location is quite good    mins walk from Mall of the Emirates Room size is decent but bathroom was small  However  they were clean and modern and definitely fit for its purpose Breakfast at    DHS was good value   all you can eat  Didn t eat dinner there or use the bar Internet available in room  wired access  or at lobby which is wireless  Prepaid vouchers available from reception starting from   DHS for  hr No safes in room but secure safes available at reception Plenty of taxis always available outside of the hotel to explore Dubai If you want to see Dubai and only want somewhere to throw your head down at night  without breaking the bank  this is the place for you  
P =>   Nice Hotel   But its an Ibis So you get what it says on the tin Just a point of note before we start  the photographs of the hotel on the TA website are not that of the hotel Despite the above  the hotel is fine and if you want a cheap room this is one for you  We arrived very early having travelled overnight and were told we could not have our rooms until   pm  bit of a pain but ok  however after a couple of hours sleeping in the lobby  the receptionist let us have our rooms at about         thank you receptionist The reception staff were polite and on the whole spoke good English and were generally helpful  On getting to the room  there were no tea or coffee facilities  but that was not a problem  but would have been nice  The rooms are basic  but it s an Ibis and you get what you pay for  the breakfast was excellent  good choice and plenty of it The location is fine if you like shopping as it is next to the Mall of the Emirates and if you like Turkish food  come out of the hotel  turn left and walk down the road where there is a great little Turkish  and cheap  restaurant to enjoy  Taxies are also easy to get and some even rank outside While we were there  we were allowed to use the breakfast area as a small office i e  laying drawings out and were not mithered in any way   thank you hotel Just a few points to wrap up  shoe cleaners are provided   great in a dusty environment  rooms were not vacuumed daily   poor and while we were there  the bar had a special offer of two for one beers making the beer about       a pint   great Would I stay there again yes  is it a place to go and have a hotel experience   no  but if you are just visiting and what a cheap room it would be difficult to beat  
P =>   Awesome  Brand new  clean  spotless  great location  right beside Ski Dubai and Mall of the Emirates  it is walking distance to the metro and bus routes  The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating  Restaurant food is delicious  The only downside is that internet use is expensive      hr  
P =>  Such good value in a very expensive city Accommodation in Dubai is great and prices are rather high  We found this was one of the cheapest hotels within reach of all the sights and activities  at     AED per room per night we thought it was a bargain  The room was a standard size for an Ibis hotel  but comfortable and large enough for us for   nights with   kgs of luggage  The room and bathroom were always clean and well presented  with a hair dryer  TV  wardrobe and desk  Due to the cheap price of the room it didn t have the other basics you would expect in an Ibis room  no kettle  tea or coffee  no fridge  which would ve been a huge help in such a hot dusty city   no rubbish bin in the room and we didn t have any small towels either  As with everywhere in Dubai  the A C was cranked up in this hotel  but in the room you could adjust the temperature to suit The location of this hotel confused a few taxi drivers who had only heard of the other   Ibis hotels in Dubai  but a quick point on the map before taxi departure and we were fine  This hotel is a   minute short walk away from the huge Mall of Emirates  This Mall houses loads of eateries  don t go to Toast  it s awful  the food is microwaved and is worse than aeroplane food    shops including a supermarket and Ski Dubai  The newly opened Metro has a station here which we found really helpful to get around Dubai without our own transport  it s cheap too  This hotel is also a short drive away from the Jumeirah Palm  Wild Wadi Waterpark  the Burj Al Arab and the Madinat Jumeirah  so you won t spend a fortune in taxi fares  The reception staff generally were pleasant  We had a slight language barrier with one staff member who could ve been nicer  but no major problems  The reception is quite modern as are the rooms  no drab curtain or lampshades in sight Overall this was a really good  cheap place to stay whether on a budget or not  in an excellent location with great transport links  
P =>  Very good hotel Highly recomanded We stayed there   nights  Conveniently located next to a very important mall  the hotel is stylish  and the rooms are clean  BENJAMIN at the reception was very friendly and helpful  Only bad note is the cost of Internet  extremely high  
P =>   great value but small rooms Good location  clean  nice reception  for only    AED night its a good value Rooms very small  no room service  no pool and no gym one of the receptionists  phillippino lady  was very nice and friendly  they didnt charge me when internet connection was bad one day and she arranged delivery to my room eventhough its not the hotel policy  that made a good impression for me  
P =>   Stylish and Great Value Only stayed for one night as a stopover from the Maldives before flying home  We chose this hotel because of it s proximity to the Mall of the Emirates  It s literally a   minute walk from the Mall  so if you have an urge to shop  this is the hotel for you The hotel is new and very stylishly decorated  Our room was clean  compact but ideal for the few hours we were spending in it  Bathroom is tiny  nicely kitted out though  excellent hairdryer and good toiletries We had lunch in the Deli and it was good  service excellent  We ate again at night in the hotel  purely because we wanted an early dinner and due to Ramadam  all eateries in the Mall were closed until     pm  The restaurant was impressive  again immpecible service and decent food with a good choice I would have no hesitation is recommending this hotel  Possibly not for more than a couple of nights stay  as the rooms are small and have very limited storage space  However as a stopover for     per room  it s tremendous value
