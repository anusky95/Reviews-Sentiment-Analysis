P => Lots of charm   and a few quirks This lovely auberge has a lot going for it a brilliant location in the heart of vieux Montreal very large and attractive rooms with bare beams exposed brick hardwood floors and large windows   ours looked out over the river  The ensuite bathroom was a dream wonderfully spacious and well equipped with an abundance of fluffy towels and quality products a shower with lashings of hot water and a arate jacuzzi tub  FabulousBreakfasts were good  A continental breakfast buffet was laid out together with menu service that included full English breakfasts omelettes pancakes etc  We also enjoyed an excellent dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant Quirks As has been mentioned by other guests there seems to be some under staffing  Although courteous friendly and ultimately responsive the front desk staff person is also responsible for answering the phone and taking reservations   which can mean quite a wait for incoming or outgoing guests  When we arrived our room was extremely cold in part due to a faulty thermostat and not helped by the faulty window sealing which allowed frigid Montreal air to whistle through  The brick wall beside the window was also crumbling in places resulting in small piles of dust and brick fragments on the windowsill and floor  We also expressed disappointment to the front desk that here was no means to make coffee or tea in the room  By the time we returned to our room that afternoon a portable heater was waiting for us together with what appeared to be a brand new coffee maker   complete with coffee cream etc  Thats serviceAll in an experience that I would recommend  
P => A High Point in our Travels We were pleased from the outset with this hotel  Truly one of the high points of our  state and  province tour of the Northeast  The staff was rekably attentive although we thought at times the hotel was short staffed for all that was expected of them  Still we never got an ounce of attitude from the front desk the valets maids bar or restaurant  All were attentive to our needs  In addition the rooms were nicely orated clean and comfortable  The wine and cheese hour is a delight and the breakfast was delicious    really  This hotel was for us one of the best aspects of our trip to Montreal  Well go back to Montreal just to stay here again  
P => Lofts   EXCELLENT I stayed in a loft above a restaurant and could not have been more pleased  The room was fabulous the people VERY nice the view fantastic  The noise level was very low on the street and the restaurant but it was ober  The loft was in the middle of the quotplace to bequot  Others I went with stayed in hotels Hilton Sheraton and were very disappointed they did not take the Tripadvisor recommendation to stay at Auberge du Vieux Port  Cant go wrong staying here   its where those in the know stay  
P => Greet the staff and get prepared for an argument about almost everything such a disappointment from beginning to end The unhelpful disinterested arrogant staff watched us spiral out ofcontrol without helping to give any ideas for visiting local attractions to eating at local restaurants  Just avoid the breakfast it takes way too long they run out of supplies anyway and treat you as if you are a real quotbotherquot to be ignored and youre taking up valuable time in their day  The quotdeluxequot room had trash pickup at am in the morning outside your window  Hope that you like lots of morning noise The hotel should take a course  in welcoming guests especially tourism and making people feel special and happy that they chose to stay there over all the hundreds of places to stay in montreal In retrospect we should have chosen another place that a friend recommended  We are Very sad because this completely ruined our trip to Canada  
P => Simply Superb When booking a small hotel in a large city never previously visited one never knows if you have chosen wisely regarding location cleanliness amenities etc  I must have looked at  places in Montreal when planning where we would spend our th anniversary and Auberge du Vieux Port was absolutely the perfect choice  Excellent linens including robes high end bath products multiple breakfast choices such as crepes amp omelettes included in addition to the buffet evening cheese and a glass of wine also included  The fact that a small hotel in an old building has an elevator is a rare treat The location is ideal as it is easy to access the rest of the city via subway or bus from the hotel and you are in the heart of Old Montreal which is the part of town to simply walk and enjoy  Some of the very old aspects of the building have been preserved like stone walls but everything else is very up to date  Our room which had an immense jacuzzi tub plus arate shower did not face the river of which we were actually glad since that street tends to be very busy and therefore noisy all the time  Our only disappointment was the rooftop restaurant the on line pictures made it look like a place for a special event dinner when its really only a place to stop for one drink but there are a multitude of wonderful restaurants very near the hotel  
P => Beautiful Hotel with Lovely Staff Originally we thought we would be in the lofts down the street but wound up staying on the top floor of the main hotel in a back room overly Rue St  Paul  The suite was exactly as advertised and the terrace was wonderful the curry chicken salad was quite refreshing on a hot summer day  Frederic greeted us at the door and was always delightful  The hotel itself is excellently located in the old town and we walked EVERYWHERE The breakfast that is included is varied enough to not get tiring and the staff are always willing to try and meet any special requests  Check out was easy and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay The restaurant menu is a bit limited but the food wasnt disappointing and there are tons of restaurants near by  
P => Amazing This is a beautiful small quaint boutique type hotel with all the charm of surrounding Old Montreal  The service especially Michael the rooms the restaurants and the ambience were just what I was hoping for  Full concierge service full breakfast included in stay wine and cheese with jazz music included turndown service and even monogrammed robes and umbrellas in the room  The river view room was a little noisy during the night but the other perks made it worthwhile  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Attractive clean and peaceful Extremely attractive rooms and I was lucky enough to have one with a wide view over the river Bed extremely comfortable bathroom facilities excellent Copious breakfast although unfortunately served in a rather dark basement dining room Staff on the whole very efficient and pleasant though with one unfortunate exception Generally speaking highly recommended  
P => excellent choice I would like to confirm all the positive feedback on this hotel It is in a great location with many choices of restaurants nearby The staff at the hotel were the best I have ever come across   lots of time for you and very helpful   my husband needed a dor whilst there and Michael did his utmost to assist us Although I had a lovely room overlooking the ina I was disappointed it did not have a jacuzzi  I asked the staff to be moved and I was given the first available room with a jacuzzi which I greatly appreciated after long days of walking around The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are just as they appear on the internet   lots of charm and character I would definately stay here again and would highly recommend it   
P => some kinks but enjoyable stay we spent  nites at the auberge   and   we reserved a deluxe king room and checked into the room the ac was not working  we were told to give it some time  so we went out and enjoyed the city  came back after pm and the ac was still not working  the night manager came up to check and said that it was broken and brought us  fans  it was fairly hot that nite and we didnt sleep well the next morining we spoke to the manager  he was very busy but after he gave us his undivided attention he switched us to a different room with functioning ac and ended up comping us the first nite we would have rather been comfortable the first nite than have it for free but ok both rooms and bathrooms were very spacious with brick and stone   the hotel itself was nicely reated and is comfortable and charming  there is a breakfast room in the basement that is lovely and a rooftop bar with river views asked the staff for restaurant recommendations and ended up at an excellent italian trattoria  cafe via dante in petite italie  not touristy at all with wonderful food and service and noot crazy expensive the next nite we ended up at chao phraya an excellent thai place in a non touristy residential part of town so but for the ac issues i would give it  stars  
P => Wonderful hotel My family spent  nights at this hotel in late e   We had  rooms overlooking the main road  The rooms were charming much the same as shown in the photos provided on the website  Exposed brick wood floors  It is a really old building but the rooms are reated and charming  They are also a good size  Breakfast was served in the basement which is also very nice  The only negative to the experience is the street can be somewhat noisy but with the windows shut it was not a problem  The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly  One of the  nights was spent in an apartment managed by the hotel in a different building  We changed our plans late and they could not get us a th night in the main auberge  The apt was OK and actually a great value at just over  a night for a  bedroom unit  While it was nice the main auberge is a much nicer experience but if you are looking for something more affordable it is a solid choice  The hotel is in a nice part of the city with restaurants everywhere although a bit pricey  Its about a  block easy walk to the metro  We highly recommend this hotel  We tend to be really fussy and not shy to voice complaints but really had none during this stay  
P => Nice Quaint Hotel We stayed here in early ch  The hotel is in an excellent location in Old Montreal  The hotel is gorgeous very European  The staff is absolutely excellent and are truly there to serve you  The rooms have hardwood floors and are very comfortable  Old Montreal at this time of the year is quite dead the restaurants close early and I didnt think there was much to do  We ended up spending the majority of our time downtown which is about a  minute walk from Old Montreal  I have been to Old Montreal in the summer and it is definitely more lively than it is in the winter spring  
P => Staff neglected to tell us some things The Hotel itself is one of the most picturesque in old Montreal We stayed in the lofts whichwe were not toldwere about a block and a half away above a restaurant thats owned by the hotel There was no lift and it was a  story walkup again we were not informed The lofts are spacious but the furniture in ours was old and worn My friends rooms furniture was much nicer The beds are huge kings and pretty comfortable A huge problem was the windows I dont know about the rest but   does not have double paned glass and it is very noisy at night and you can hear everything We only stayed for a night but that was a big concern The staff was very helpfulespecially the conciergedoorman They offer valet parking for a fee and will retrieve your car at any time They also gave us an extended checkout The hotel itself looks real niceespecially the main restaurant and the location is excellent  
P => Beautiful building excellent location We choose this property via the Montreal tourism web sites Sweet Deal Promotion but cross checked available properties here on Trip Advisor We were very pleased overall with the property the service the room and the food the hotel serves a complimentary breakfast with choice of entree and access to buffet for guests  We would stay here again without question and would recommend it to our friends Of note This part of Montreal has heavy pedestrian traffic and is busy at night which is part of its charm  Our stay began on a weeknight and ran into the weekend  The increase in noise from the street was significant on Saturday night  Our room was located on the third floor which more or less negated this problem and if you are sensitive to noise you might want to try and get a room on an upper level  While there are train tracks nearby we found that the train itself was a non issue even with our windows wide open  
P => Old world charm in the heart of Old Montreal My wife and I visited Montreal for a long weekend getaway and chose the Auberge du Vieux Port after a quick web search  The hotel consists of five arate buildings located along the riverside in Old Montreal We chose a loft apartment which was clean and well equipped with large windows looking out onto the street  As some reviewers have mentioned the lofts are not brand new or designer chic but they are very cosy and comfortable like a well lived in apartment with lots of exposed brick and timber floors  The kitchen was roomy and well equipped although we didnt use it as the local restaurants are excellent  Like most New Zealanders we dont speak a word of French but the hotel staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful If you are staying in Old Montreal its well worth renting a bicycle and cycling along the riverside  There are over km of bike tracks throughout the city and its a great way to look around  We had a great stay at the Auberge and recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal  
P => Excellent My wife and I stayed for two nights in early il and couldnt have been happier with our choice  Room furnishings desk service bathrooms etc  were all excellent but it was a few extra touches with which we were most impressed  First there is a wine and cheese between  and  which was lovely  Guests get a free glass of wine and can nibble on brie and gouda served with fresh baguette  Also guests get free breakfast  Not quotcontinentalquot as is the norm but hot cooked from a menu breakfast  Overall this hotel was a big part of a perfect weekend  
P => An Excellent Stay  My wife and I stayed  nights in ch   We very much enjoyed the excellent service  The staff was friendly and very helpful to recommend restaurants and provide directions  The room was very nice with high celings stylish furnishings and a very nice jacuzzi tub  The only drawback is that the walls seem a bit thin and you can hear street sounds and anyone next door  But I would highly recommend this hotel and congratualte the staff on an excellent job  
P => Wonderful Inn with a personal touch  Top notch customer service very clean rooms with quality linens  The Inn has a lovely ambiance and the staff are very welcoming and more than helpful in English or French  An early arrival in Montreal mid uary meant we were at the hotel earlier than expected  We were checked in and given great directions for our itinerary over the next few days not to mention a few other useful tips and places to visit  I even noticed one of the managers have a discussion with staff on the best fruit to have in the foyer for the clients  Attention to detail seemed to be where their mindset is  The complimentary cheese and wine for the guests served  pm is a great touch  The little bar is cozy and with some jazz in the evening there wasnt much of an urge to head out to the cold Montreal streets to sightsee  Location is great to visit the Old City and Notre Dame is only  or  minutes walk away  A tip to go to the Jean Talon ket proved invaluable to us foodies  I could go on but    try it out makes a great winter getaway KC 
P => Very good stay Stayed on the first floor with the original exposed brickwork  Very nice room only comment would be the slight noise from the road outside and the trains m away Overall would use again  
P => Gorgeous building   Great service We booked on short notice and based on the website pictures and some reviews  As always you never know if the actual hotel is as beautiful as the pictures on the website there was no doubt we were in the right place  It was warm considering it was ruary and  C without the wind not pretentious but classy and the staff were pleasant helpful and volunteered useful information  Some hotels you have to do all the work by asking  questions they answered your questions before you could even ask  We were lucky to be upgraded and had a beautiful King Size room with double jacuzzi with a view of the river  The room was welcoming and warm the food was delicious and the rates were very reasonable  A rare find   definitely recommended  
P => Avoid the Lofts   at least Paid a premium price based on what I saw on the computer   very disappointing   expected some character but also some better quality  The only ent piece of furniture was the bed which was very comfortable  The table was a very basic kitchen table with chips in the formica top the sofa bed was so uncomfortable my son had to put the mattress on the floor to sleep as well as being well used like the matching love seat one of the prints on the wall was sliding out of its frame the remote control for the TV didnt work perhaps because it was a different brand  Most disappointing though was the bathroom  Rather than something comparable to a high end Sheraton   the walk in glass doored shower and avante garde wash basin I saw a picture of we had a small cramped bathroom more in keeping with an average highway motel  The wash basin had several chips in the porcelain and the cheap plywood door didnt close properly On a positive note the staff were very friendly and accommodating The concept of the loft is great   we didnt mind the stairs   wouldnt expect to find a loft on the ground floor And blends well with the old world nature of Old Montreals architecture  However reality did not meet our expectations Perhaps I should give the hotel the benefit of the doubt   we booked late so perhaps we got the worst of the lofts This review is more of a warning than a complaint   I didnt complain to management  Why Because my wife and I were there with our two grown children on a short vacation  The opportunities to do so get fewer as the children get older  The loft was large enough for us to enjoy each others company and the city of Montreal offered lots to do  We werent going to let the lofts short comings detract from our time together   I wont however stay there again  
P => Still a good place    Although it was a better buy a few years ago with the exchange rate and increases its still a great respite in Old Montreal  If you wanta ton of amenties like a gym go to the Omni  otherwise for quaint charming comfort  choose the Auberge  
P => Still a charmer but could use some improvements     We have not stayed at the Auberge du Vieux Port for a few years so we figured it was time to revisit this old favourite The hotel still has its charms but this year is its th anniversary and the hotel is showing its age in small ways The upholstered bench in our room had a noticeable hole in the corner with the stuffing coming out  The caulking around the bathroom sink was all mildewy and deteriorating    it ought to have been replaced ages ago  That sort of thing  Nothing major but it all adds up Also the Narcisse the new wine bar is not as nice as the old Les Remparts restaurant either in atmosphere or menu However the service continues to be impeccable  Staff are friendly and helpful at all times    they certainly made the stay very pleasant  
P => wonderful I waited until the last minute to book a trip to Montreal and had few choices as to where to stay  I saw Auberge Vieux du Port and it looked nice so I blindly took a chance  Sometimes dumb luck is the best way to travel On the way up to Montreal I took a recent copy of Conde Nast with their annual readers poll  Turns out Auberge was the number  hotel in Montreal and number  in all of Canada I understand why it gets high ks  The staff is outstanding the hotel is adorable the location is perfect and there are so many little things they do well  I was on my own but was always comfortable and well taken care of  The concierge gave me her card when I checked in    just in case I had any questions while out and about and then called my room to make sure that quoteverything was perfect quotThere is a wine and cheese reception in the bar each evening  The bedding rivaled top hotels in Europe  And I could not have been happier in the Old Port section of Montreal  It is magical at night when the lights come on there are adorable shops restaurants galore and art galleries to poke around in The food scene in Montreal is amazing  I had some of the best meals ever and felt that had I chosen other restaurants I still would have  There are so many to choose from I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a boutique well serviced comfortable experience  Oh and their restaurant was very good too  
P => This place is amazing We needed a break and this hotel was the answer in spades   from the moment we arrived until the concierge got us in our cab complete with coffees   what a lovely property   the room was so charming and the linens soft and luxurious   beautiful breakfasts each morning and wine and cheese after a full day of shopping just steps from the front door in Old Montreal   well defineatley be back   I think this will be an annual tradition for us now    romantic   and we cant say enough about the staff   they were amazing   thanks for a much needed getaway   were ready for the real world again 
P => Loved the Vieux Port     We spent  nights at the Auberge in mid ober and found the location service staff and rooms all that we would have wanted Also the buffet breakfast served in a wine cellar like room was very good  Although we were initially disappointed that their restaurant Les Remparts had recently closed the concierge made us reservations at other highly recommended places including Restaurant Bonaparte and Pinxto Spanish tapas The valet brought our car within  minutes each time we requested it and everyone working at the hotel including the breakfast room server went out of their way to be helpful and friendly  In fact when the woman in charge of breakfast noticed that my husband was making a hot chocolate from the buffet she offered to go to the kitchen and make a cup with better cocoa and milk not water  A small nicety perhaps but an example of the staffs generous attitude  We liked walking to most places and the archeology museum and Science center with Imax theater are right nearby as is Rue St  Paul  
P => Excellent location We were staying at one of the lofts which are owned by the hotel  On arrival the staff were helpful and attentive and drove us from the hotel to our apartment located within  metres of the hotel  The  bedroomed apartment was in an old converted building and beautifully furnished  The location of the loft in Montreals old town was perfect and there were many resturants street entertainers and shops within a  minute walk  Our car was valet parked by the hotel staff and was brought to us whenever we needed it within  minutes of a phone call to reception  Our only criticisms of the lofts du vieux port were that the apartment proved to be quite dark and the lighting wasnt sufficient plus the front bedroom which faced onto the street was very noisy at night due to the downstairs restaurants  
P => Highly Recommend The location was excellent  The staff courteous and professional  We were pleased with the room the breakfast and wine and cheese included  The restaurant was first rate as well  We have traveled quite a bit and found this hotel to be a very good value  
P => Very Nice Hotel We just got back from staying at this hotel and it did not disappoint  We were debating between the other numerous boutique hotels in Old Montreal and were glad we settled on this hotel  I am surprised to see it so low on the the tripadvisor rankings  The location is perfect facing the port and the other side of the hotel facing rue St  Paul  The hotel is a great intimate size very high ceilings comfy beds clean rooms   and attentive staff  After getting to our room and settling in a little bit the front desk called to check everything was okay and if we needed anything else   it was a nice touch A few minor concerns    if you are sensitive to sound avoid staying on the st  paul side    it was loud at night on the weekend and will wake you up if you are a light sleeper  The elevator is very slow  The restaurant service was questionable   we tried a couple of times to eat on the roof terrace but the service was not very good    lots of food choices in the area I would suggest going elsewhere   Otherwise a great hotel    I would stay there again  
P => Great spot   The Auberge is quite a romantic place to stay in an utterly romantic town The rooms are gorgeous the staff works overtime to make sure everything is comfortable  My only advice is to try and get a room that faces the port   the street side can get a little noisy with all the merriment going on in old Montreal  
P => Very Nice Hotel in a Wonderful Location We stayed at the Auberge du Vieux Port for two nights while in Montreal as part of our Honeymoon  The Front Desk staff was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed  They also gave us some information regarding things to do around Montreal  The hotel is only  rooms and our room had everything we needed  It appears to be kept up well and probably had been reated in the last few years  You also receive a ticket for each nights wine and cheese reception in the bar  The location of the hotel is very central to the older part of Montreal and makes it very accessible to the city  Overall the hotel staff is very accommodating  The only issues we had were trying to get their wifi to work with a code that they provide  I had to call the front desk numerous times to get a new code and finally gave up  Also check your bill when you leave as they charged me for both nights even though I had already paid a deposit in advance when I booked for the first night which it does not tell you on their website when you book it was the next day I received an email saying they would charge me the one night deposit  
P => Had a most enjoyable stay While our directions from Expedia left us in the middle of somewhere and we had to call someone at am at home to get proper directions we arrived quite weary  The doorman was not there but the front desk clerk was more than happy to assist us with our luggage The room was warm and roomy  The windows were huge which provided us with much sunshine and a great view  The wood floors were a nice touch  We were there during the coldest week in   many of the shops and restaurants were closed until il  The staff was more than happy to assist at any moment especially with dining recommendations  Mattieu the doorman went out of his way for us many times to call a taxi or bring us something that we left in the car  The cheeses at the wine reception were excellent as were the breakfasts  I would stay here again in a heartbeatThe location is easily accesible to any area of Old Montreal and Montreal  
P => Didnt meet my expectations I booked a deluxe double room with a view of the river at the Auberge du Vieux Port for under   per night  The price included breakfast an evening cocktail hour a Jacuzzi tub and I thought I was getting a great deal  However the hotel didn t live up to my expectations even for the price  I ve stayed at several boutique hotels in Montreal and Quebec City but I didn t find the Vieux Port up to par  When we arrived at the hotel we had to carry our bags from the car in the snow while the doorman looked on  Once the bags were in the hotel he was only too happy to wheel them up to our room  The room itself was very large but oddly furnished with an eclectic mix of old world reproductions and modern boutique touches  It didn t seem to work  In addition the room was always making some kind of noise either the bar fridge was rattling or the heating system was whirring or the neighbours  television could be heard through the walls at all hours of the night  I don t usually have difficulty sleeping but the noises kept me up or woke me up most nights  The sparse cold breakfast buffet was mented with hot entrees from the menu at no cost which was a nice touch  Unfortunately I was not too impressed with the food  Everything looked nice but didn t have much taste  Both at breakfast and dinner they seemed to be more concerned with style over substance  The restaurant itself is in the basement and contains remains of the original wall around the city  Again however the d cor in the restaurant was a mix of historical architecture and faux facades made to look historic which in my mind made everything look fake  I understand the hotel is due for a reation in the near future so in the meantime try one of their sister hotels   the Nelligan or Place Des Armes  
P => The lofts are amazing My husband and I stayed at this lovely property this past y  The staff made a scheduling error and we were upgraded to a loft room instead of the kingriver view I originally booked  The lofts are in another building close by the hotel  There is no river view but there is no need  The loft was just amazing    levels crisp clean or fabulous bathroom with a  person jacuzzi  The kitchen was lovely with every amenity possible  The living area with a couch  chairs ottoman tv cd player stereo  The bedroom with a very comfortable king size bed tv dresser  It was a huge luxurious way to spend time in Montreal   After a couple days in Quebec City we returned and were given our reserved room in the hotel  I would not suggest this room   it was on a very perceptible line  This sounds ridiculous but it was very bothersome to have a room that tilted toward the doorway  The room was not really special in any other way either  The river view is not spectacular   not very picturesque and you can hear noise from the street  The breakfastwine and cheese offering at happy hour are an added luxury and very nicely presented If you can treat yourself to one of the loft rooms please do so   you wont be disappointed 
P => warm clean and friendly Selected the auberge on the basis of the previous reviews here  very friendly staff a charming room with an exceptional KB  Tasty and eleguant breakfast included An excellent location for taking a stroll in old historical Montreal  Will send my friends there  
P => Great Location great staff We went to Montreal on a quick mini moon following our wedding and stayed at Auberge du Vieux Port  One of the best things about this hotel is its location in Old Montreal across the water  Its close to everything including the metro station  The staff is very friendly and would do anything to make guests happy when we came in late one night they were trying to get hot chocolate for one of the guests who wanted it  The free breakfast is to die for especially fruit pancakes with chocolate and english cream  The rooms are uniquely orated with exposed beams etc but I must say they look better in the pictures than real life  The bathrooms are huge and jacuzzi is great though  Overall I recommend this hotel to those who are looking the splurge for a few days  Its not luxurious but definetely worth the price due to staff location and unique quality  
P => Fantastic Service   Cute Hotel This is a fantastic hotel  Its in a great location to see Old Montreal the included breakfast is amazing and this hotel stops at nothing to make sure you are happy with your stay  We expressed interest in going to a Montreal Canadiens game while we were there when we came home that night we had tickets waiting for us on our pillows  
P => Lofts du Vieux Port    great for the independent traveler The lofts are arate apartments in the Vieux Port near the Auberge du Vieux Port  The apartments are totally self sufficient large open  They are contemporary without being coldly modern retaining some of the classic features of the building  Room service from the hotel and Restaurant du Viuex Port was available which was a nice touch after touring all day The only negative was from the e mail exchanges I was told all amenities of the Auberge were available to us  When I checked out I was told that did not include breakfast and depsite showing the e mail was not reimbursed  As the service was pathetically slow for breakfast we only ate there once  Instead we had brie baguette fruit coffee and juice in the comfort of quotour ownquot kitchen  A MAJOR POSITIVE however was I left my cell phone in the loft and it was promptly mailed to me with no charge btw Phillip and Michael were quite welcoming and helpful  
P => ent but needs updating  We stayed at the St  Antoine in Quebec City which was tremendous so perhaps we were just a little expectant in what we would find particularly after the glowing reviews here  The lobby is impressive the wine was a nice touch and the cheese good but the bread aka cracker was a little odd    tough and very brown  The croissants at breakfast were truly some of the best wed ever tried which is a positive  What is odd is after such an up to date lobby hip almost in black and fine furnishings that the room was so dumpy  Our room  was large but the bed was very worn    flat matress polycotton sheets and none of the plumpness or fluff you expect in high quality hotels    the comforter was a standard issue floral print with no charm  That led to an otherwise dreary appearance to the room    done in simple whites with upgraded bedding and wed have changed our opinion  The brouchure in the room appeared to have some updated rooms so perhaps we just got a bad one   either way it was a disappointment  And yes the bathroom was large with nice toiletries but the shower was the dingy fiberglass and aluminum insert in the corner with just a trickle of water after you managed to work the button on the bottom very odd  What is surprising is that this hotel is owned by the same folks as the Nelligan    which was right around the corner and looked amazing    and very upscale  Old City hints Avoid the square around the corner and the restaurants there    very poor examples given the options further down rue St  Paul  Great coffeecroissant place called Olive Gourmand or something on St  Paul and a great fun steak restaurant on McGill and St  Paul Holder or something  Very nice and not expensive  Net Stay at the Auberge if you like larger rooms are on a budget and do not have high expectations    you will do fine  If you are particular and do not mind paying a little more do the Nelligan  
P => Cute but Fraying Having now stayed in similar class and priced rooms at the Bonaparte and Nelligan in Montreal I checked in expecting a four star but check out disappointed  My homework indicated this as one of the best players in the quaint heritage boutique properties in the old part of the town and it is but its quickly being outclassed by others The common areas upon walk in are well appointed and the wine and cheese presentation is enjoyable with an LCD TV tastefully mounted to the quarter millenia old exposed rock wall  Not so well appointed were the well meaning staff who need to be given a stipend to replace the worse for wear issue uniforms  While pleasant and attentive requests for reservation assistance at local popular eateries were a challenge The room was probably not one of their larger models but was unnecessarily dark for this weary traveller  That advertised on the website large expanse of enchanting stonework was but a half meter wide and while the view was enjoyable it had been a long summer for those grimy windows Bed and bath is what cost the fourth star  The bath was clean the basin pretty but the shower stall was a not  so clever solution  The shower stall had a unexplicable bath nossle that required its operation  And in this class of auberge a fiberglass and aluminum framed enclosed shower isnt the best  Most telling was the bathrobe which like the hard used bed indicated fraying at this hotel  I do hope the managment which handles truly enjoyable properties nearby attends to the details which patrons expect at this sort of establishment A lot of reviews needlessly gripe over the cobblestone road the street noise is not disturbing  
P => Nice big room We stayed in a large loft style two bedroom apartment across from the hotel in a nearby building they own or own some rooms in  The furnishings were above average some walls were brick and we were loud but still without bothering anyone  Perfect for large groups  We stayed top floor and the room was prob  sq  feet  I have no idea about the breakfasts part but valet was good  
P => A     Must stay here This is a charming small hotel in the perfect location in Montreal  Great rooms with wonderful furnishings  Worth the price  Dont miss the complimentary winecheese cocktail hour  We stayed in room  which is on side of the hotel that overlooks a busy shopping area so it was a little noise in the evening but not a big deal  
P => Excellent All round first class establishment with helpful and attentive staff wonderful rooms and very well appointed communal areas  We stayed just one night but would happily return  
P => great hotel stay We arrived at the hotel for  nights and could not have been happier with our stay  All of the hotel staff was excellent and were willing to help in any way that they could   with restaurant advice or directions especially Michael at the desk and Brian at the door  The breakfasts were wonderful   french toast eggs benedict omlettes  You could order anything that you wanted from the menu along with coffe and juice  Every evening between  and  you could have a free glass of wine with fruit cheese and bread  All of this was included in your room rate  The rooms were also great  We had a beautiful view of the port from our fifth floor room  We travel frequently have high expectations and were not disappointed  
P => Nice But Lacking    The building itself is quite laudable in its rustic French Canadian charm  However the high school aged staff seems a bit dumbfounded if not well meaning at times  On the first morning of our stay we were informed by our waitress that a continental breakfast was included with our daily room rate  Unfortunately on the th day we were informed that we were entitled to a full breakfast  The front of the building although offering attractive water views is extremely loud due to a long patch of uneven cobblestones  A room on the higher floors is recomended  Also a quick check of the window safety rail is advisable  Ours was missing a screw and dangerously loose 
P => Lovely Boutique Hotel in Great Location My husband and I stayed at this hotel in early tember  The roombathroom were more spacious than we expected  We loved the ambiance of the room with an exposed brick wall behind the bed  The bathroom had a whirlpool tub that was great after a long day of sightseeing We arrived on Labour Day and the front desk staff was very helpful in pointing out activities that we could do despite all of the museums and shops being closed We were pleased with the location right near the Vieux Port  Our favorite activity was renting bikes next door and riding along the Canal de Lachine as well as the Ile Note Dame and Ile Sainte Helene  Highly RecommendedThe complimentary breakfast and evening winecheese were lovely  We had some trouble one morning with the breakfast as did other guests  It seemed the server wasnt as fluent in English as he be should have been and had trouble communicating our orders  That being forgiven we absolutely loved everything else about our stay  
P => Very Nice My husband and I stayed at Auberge du Vieux Port for two nights in y  What a nice place We arrived late in the afternoon hot tired and somewhat cranky  That all changed when we approached the front door of this hotel  We were greeted with a smile check in was fast and painless and we were quickly escorted to our room  And what a room it was Hardwood floors brick and stone walls huge windows that opened a CD player filling the room with soft music plenty of storage space and a wonderful view of Old Montreal and the port  And that was just the bedroom  The impecible bath was equally pleasing with a whirlpool tub that was especially inviting after a long day  I immediately fell in love with the aromatic Essential Elements products and the thick terry robes  Ah the crankiness was slipping awayDuring our two day stay the professional staff was consistently pleasant and most efficient  Every request was quickly fulfilled and every time we stepped off the elevator one of the staff was there to greet us by name and offer to assist in any way they could from restaurant recommendations to suggesting the best vantage point for the fireworks The breakfast included with the price of the room was excellent and the wine and cheese reception in the afternoon was a nice touch  We didnt eat at the hotel except for breakfast We thoroughly enjoyed throwing open the windows of our room to enjoy the sights and sounds below especially the street musicians and the clip clop of the horsedrawn carriages  On our last night an amazing double rainbow appeared over the river and we were able to enjoy it for several minutes through these fabulous windows  It was a perfect ending to a most romantic stay at this excellent hotel  
P => A Great Place   but requires some effort on the part of the guest My wife and I just returned from spending our first anniversary at the Auberge du Vieux Port  We booked a  night quotRomantic Packagequot that included a King sized bed jacuzzi tub one hour massages for each of us and a  course meal in the hotel restaurant  We enjoyed the room very much   the bed was very comfortable and the room was well appointed without being overly orated  Exposed brick and hardwood floors made for nice ambience Any guest at the hotel gets a full breakfast and wine and cheese at the wine bar in the evenings  We very much enjoyed the wine and cheese in the evenings and the service of the wine bar was quite good The breakfasts however left something to be desired  The first morning our server forgot to bring the sides of bacon and sausage that were included with the meal and the roasted potatoes that accompanied our omelettes were cold  The second morning my french toast failed to appear altogether and after I reminded the server of my order it showed up having obviously sat in the kitchen for some time  Finally I would advise being prepared to spend a bit of time working out some glitches with the front deskconcierge staff  They booked the reservations for the wrong day but I cht the error on the invoice prior to our trip  Twice they bungled our massage appointments and we spent quite awhile sitting at the front desk waiting for the concierge to get things sorted out to our satisfaction  They did leave a bottle of wine in our room for the trouble The dinner that came was part of the romantic package was very good  Its definitely for the more adventurous or experienced  diner but my wife and I enjoyed the food and the service quite a bit Overall a nice hotel that made for a good stay in montreal but things could have run quite a bit smoother  
P => Loved the Auberge du Vieux Port Great location great service great value  Our stay at this delightful hotel was made even better by the outstanding staff  The concierge service providers love their work and provide excellent tips for restaurants site seeing and special events  Phillipe was particularly helpful to us throughout our stay even managing to get us a roof top seat for the popular fireworks display on Wednesdays  Rooms were beautiful   exposed brick wooden rafters hard wood floors and windows with seating areas  Our room faced the park and St  Lawernce Seaway and provided us with a beautiful view  The daily breakfast was delicious and included eggs made to order waffles fresh fruit and juice and was available in the beautiful reception area  lounge portion of the hotel  Service in the lounge restaurant and hotel was excellent  I would certainly return to this property on a future visit  
P => good in a quirky way We spent two nights here  Rates include full breakfast a glass of wine between  and pm and wireless internet  The location is perfect in Old Montreal you can walk to a lot of things yet the area is quiet at night  The bedroom is large the windows open the king sized bed is very cozy positives the floor slopes noticeably in room  which is annoyingly within earshot of the metal stairway to the rooftop terrace restaurant negatives  Staff were all friendly and hospitable  
P => This is a terrific hotel  It has everything  Tremendous charm thick granite walls huge windows beamed ceilings hardwood floors wrought iron beds helpful friendly staff great restaurant on site perfect location in the heart of old Montreal  Breakfasts were very good  The omelettes were thin crepes with fillings   a bit different from ususal omelettes  I can not think of one thing that could be improved except that the front desk volunteered to send in our GST refund forms electronically and never mentioned that it was a commercial service that keeps   as a service charge  I thought it was a government internet site that would just do the refund for free   as when it is mailed in  Oh well    that helpfulness was not a plus     Other than that one terrific experience  My family would stay there again in a heartbeat  
P => Simply the BEST I can not say enough about this hotel Our stay was fanatastic and the location could not be better  The staff were very helpful and looked after our every need especially Evelyn at the front desk  We arrived tired and a little grumpy after being stuck in traffic for hours but once we arrived the staff took care of our car  We arrived at happy hour and ided to get a snack while Evelyn got us dinner reservation at a steak house a few blocks away  He had drinks and great appetizers in the bar We got to our room and it was better then the website could have ever lead us to believe  The rooms are spacious beautiful and very clean  The windows look out onto the streets of the Vieux Port and give a wonderful feel of Old Montreal  The bathrooms are large and have jacuzzi tubs  The beds are so comfortable I didnt want to go home  This really is a great hotel that makes a stay in Montreal perfect 
P => Absolutely the best We were guests at the Auberge du Vieux Port ember   The room was exactly what we were hoping it would be and more  Very cozy brick wood floors a beautiful view of the river from large windows and a large bathroom  We looked forward to returning to our room each afternoon and evening  The amenities were also very nice  The complimentary made to order breakfast was fabulous as was the complimentary wine and local cheese in the evening  The staff were extremely helpful  The location was also great   right in the heart of the old port area within walking distance of a wide choice of restaurants  
P => cant say enough Just returned from a  nite stay at the Auberge du Vieux Port We were greeted at the door by name at  p m  at night Our room was immaculate and more than charming  Roses on our bedchocolates beside the bed  Breakfast in bed the next morningbreakfast is included in your stay an extra  is charged for in room deliverydelivered in less than  min  from the call  All done with a smile and a very accomodating staff  Hats off to Matthew who parked our car delivered it to us at the appointed time with seat warmer on for me and car heated up inside along with carrying all my chrismas shopping bags   He even remembered which car was ours A wonderful spot to experience Old Montreal and only a short taxi ride away to downtown  A must to experience 
P => Romantic  Beautiful  Amazing all around My wife and I spent our first wedding anniversary in this wonderfully charming hotel  Our room was unlike anything wed stayed in before this is no plain e Hilton or Sheraton room  Between the warm inviting and well appointed room the professional and attentive hotel staff and the great location the Auberge du Vieux Port has it all  Its unfortunate that some users have had such a rough experience because we absolutely loved our experience at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone  
P => One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at     If you are going to spend any amount of time in Montreal be it on business or for pleasure you need to stay in this hotel  The location is amazing as there is not another hotel in the city located so closely to the water  You overlook a cobblestone street which runs parallel to the water and you are the foot of the Old City so all the sights are within a minutes walking distance  Aside from the location what makes this a truly special place is the service  We were attended to from the moment we walked in the door before that even as the valet alexandre was there to great us at the curb to the moment we left every need was taken care of  It is a small hotel but the rooms are huge beautiful and very clean not to mention windows which actaully OPEN and the staff is as knowledgeable and accomodating as any larger hotel in the city if not more so You must stay here you simply must  Les Remparts the restaurant was o k  not great and VERY expensive for what you get so I might suggest trying something else but aside from that its the perfect hotel for your stay in this lovely city We will return  
P => The Inn the people the food the location Awesome The inn is housed in an old building with lots of brick stone and bear beams  The rooms are lovely old world blended with modern comforts  Ours overlooked the river and had large panoramic windows  Found the bathroom very spacious with exceptional toileteries  All staff were polite and helpful  Very knowledgeable sommelier  The food was amazingmost luxurious part of stay  Breakfast was very good but dinner out of this world high end french cuisine  The wine and cheese cocktail a nice touch to our stay Location was ideal away from the hustle and bustle of downtown  Overall one of my best hotel experiences  Absolutely no complaints for me  Will definitely stay here again 
P => Lots of Personality with a view Enjoyed this hotel very much  It is right in the old port area near everything  The room was lovely with a huge bed and nice linens  The bathroom was one of the nicest bathrooms of any hotel Ive stayed in nice whirlpool bath too  The breakfasts were nice too  The only complaint I would have was the noise  We were on the th floor with a view of the port and the park area in front was a bit loud  We used our earplugs a couple of times but would still recommend this hotel  
P => Very Romantic My husband and I stayed at Auburge du Vieux Port for our rd anniversary and loved the accomodations and the staff  The rooms are so unique and charming  We happened to have a room with a view of the Saint Lawrence River and were very pleased with what we got for the price  The staff was exceptionally friendly and accomodating and more than willing to help with any suggestions for things to do in the Montreal area  My only small complaint is the road noise  My recommendation would be to get a room that is not directly on the street as the road noise is a bit loud and we awoke a few times to the sound of the train  Otherwise this is one of the nicest most romantic hotels we have ever stayed in  
P => Complete Relaxation in Pleasant Surroundings We stayed here over the Labor Day weekend and completely relaxed  The room on the fourth floor was completely as pictured no trick photos and the bed while a bit hard for my taste was made up with lovely crisp linens and a fluffy duvet  The windows even opened wide to let in a nice breeze  We slept and slept  early to bed late to rise and a nap each day in between forays into the immediate neighborhood Old Town Montreal  We ate in the hotel restaurant one night and it was pricey but quite good there are plenty of good restaurants nearby in all price ranges and our waiter was sweet and had an encyclopedic knowledge of wines  We had no complaints about the hotel service and we were especially pleased with the rooms immaculate cleanliness and the promptness of housekeeping while we were out exploring  Truly a welcome and restful getaway  Well come back to Montreal soon all that sleeping meant we didnt get to see much and we will stay here again 
P => Simply wonderful As always I consulted tripadvisor before booking  We loved this wonderful hotelThe staff were so incredibly helpful and pleasant  For the first night we stayed in one of the loft apartments around the corner it was HUGE  Very tastefully orated fireplace complete kitchen unbelievably comfy bed  Yes it is up three floors but the stairs just helped work off all those extra calories Unfortunately the next morning my dhter broke her foot  The staff could not have been more helpful  they moved us to another room in the main hotel near the elevator and treated her so kindly  I would not hesitate to stay here the location is superb the rooms are gorgeous and the staff outstanding 
P => Impeccable service Im really surprised at the negative comments this hotel has received We stayed here for  night as part of a  week honeymoon and despite spending in excess of   per night in some hotels I have to say that the levels of service we received here were possibly the best of the whole holidayGiven we only stayed for  night I did wonder whether they would offer anything complimentary for our honeymoon  I rang the hotel a few weeks before arriving and even the guy on the phone couldnt do enough to help us   this gave me a good feeling even before we got there We arrived in our room to find a bottle of champagne and some chocolates   and they were indeed complimentary All the staff were extremely helpful and gave lots of advice on were to go in the city I cant say enough about this hotel and would highly recommend a visit  
P => Nice situation shame about the service We booked this some months ago based on the fabulous reviews on tripadvisor at that time  We agree that the location is great rooms spacious nice big bathroom and shower bed really comfortable and breakfast and  a glass of wine and cheese thrown in a bonus  All as you would expect given the prices  At floor  we overlooked AC units on adjacent rooftops so I wouldnt suggest paying too much extra for quota viewquot  The real downside in our view was the lack of service that other guests and the visitors book on public display seem to rave about  We first noted this in the Terasse at lunch   overpriced and limited food on offer service very slow and the rice on the quotprawn and ricequot dish failed to materialise  When questioned we were told the menu was inaccurate i e    of the dish no longer existed  no apologies no offer of a refund  One of our rooms wasnt ready until  pm  again no apology offered despite check in being  pm  We encountered the same indifference when we ordered a bottle of overpriced wine on the hotels street terrasse   when we eventually got the waiters attention he asked if we were sitting there waiting for a taxi Wine appeared eventually and served very grudgingly no further sign of the waiter so we had to pour refills ourselves until he brought the bill not requested who knows we  have wanted to order another bottle where he overcharged us on the already inflated price  no apology was offered when we pointed this out  And whilst there were always staff lurking with walkie talkies in the dark and dingy reception area they never onced offered to open the door for us so we still have no idea of their function The other annoyance if youre on a top floor is the fact there is only one lift that also serves to carry staff and food up to the top floor restaurant so when it does eventually appear it is often too full of staff for you to get in   and of course they dont offer to take the stairs to allow guests to travel up and down  So if you do stay here wed recommend doing your dining and drinking off site and be also stay elsewhere until the staff remember that they are there to serve the hotel guests rather than orate the place and chat to one another  
P => Id LIVE in this hotel if I could My husband and I stayed at the Auberge du Vieux Port for  nights in late y and agree that this hotel provided us with one of the greatest rooms and experiences weve ever had in a hotel Excellent location  Extremely helpful friendly personable staff  Upon check in the woman at the front desk took out a map and indicated our present location and then took her time circling numerous sites of possible interest  Very generous breakfast including eggs fruit salad yogurt  Just as generous complimentary wine and cheese in the evening  Great rooftop barrestaurant with fine views BEAUTIFUL adent room bright spacious brick king bed hard wood floors    urban sophistocated elegant yet tout   fait comfortable  Windows that open to the street as music wafts through the air  Or close the windows and select your own music for the cd player provided  Relax in the jacuzzi tub with the Auberges quality bath salts and powerful jets  Turn down service includes not only chocolates on the pillow but also the weather forecast for the next day Two recommendations both in walking distance of the hotel the restaurant quotModaviequot    great wine and live music with dinner  Also check out quotJardin Nelsonquot for some quality jazz outdoors and an after dinner drink I should mention the two small negative experiences at the Auberge  Our room was not ready for us at check in time  We went to the rooftop bar and had drinks not comped and returned an hour later to the front desk  Still not ready and still nothing offered for our trouble  In  minutes the room was finally available  Also one morning I ordered a hot chocolate with breakfast that was divine  I assumed it was a usual beverage choice such as coffee or tea that is included  No  I was told afterwards that I had to pay for it  Not a huge deal but I thought a bit out of the ordinary Nevertheless I would recommend this hotel    My husband and I loved Montreal and would return to the Auberge in a heart beat  
P => World Class Hotel With Warmth My husband teenage son and I just returned from five nights at this wonderful Hotel  We had two connecting rooms on the third floor overlooking the Saint Lawrence River  When we arrived exhausted after a long drive they were warm and welcoming and quickly helped us get settled in our rooms  When we ordered room service from the Restaurant they brought an extra table and set up our elegant and delicious dinner for us  Our King Size bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in other than ours at home  The jacuzzi was deep and comfortable  The rooms were even more beautiful and spacious than they appeared on their website  It was so nice to have a CD Player in our rooms and to be able to choose CDs from the Hotels own collection The full breakfast was excellent with many choices including omelettes croissants and other pastries  In addition to Les Ramparts in the Hotel there are several good restaurants within a few blocks of the Hotel including a little cafe LIntrigue specializing in seafood mussels and quotfritesquot which is a  block from the Hotel out the front door and to the right All staff members were friendly and helpful yet low key  We have stayed in Hotels around the world and it will be difficult to be satisfied with anything less after having experienced the Auberge du Vieux Port 
P => great but noisy Charming hotel but can be very noisy on the weekends  The rooms facing away from the water had the late bar crowd  Could not sleep that evening  Sunday quieted down substantially  Staff was very friendly and helpful with planning activities for children  
P => Great for Couples but not for small children    The hotel and rooms are beautiful and it would be a lovely place to stay for a couple but is not to be recommended for travellers with an infant or child The steps leading up to the hotel are steep and assistance is required with a pushchair  The staff there have no experience of children and no facilities I asked for a highchair and it only materialised once so it was a bit of a struggle We asked for advice on where to go and activities with an infant but staff were clueless  We checked out a day early in the end Food was average and expensive and wine was astronomical  
P => Comfortable historic hotel in Montreals Old Port I stayed at Auberge du Vieux Port for four nights over Memorial Day  The hotel is in a lovely stone historical building that was once a saddle company  It overlooks the cobblestone Rue de la Commune which is the main drag of the Old Port and is packed with tourists day and night  We were on the third floor and the noise was quite loud particularly in early afternoon when tour buses would idle outside the hotel waiting for their passengers  Our room had two sets of huge French windows and while we could have shut them to dampen the noise the weather was beautiful and it seemed a shame not to have the windows opened wide  The room was of regular size  not as large as I would have liked given the price but the bathroom was massive and included a two person whirlpool tub and erate shower  The complementary toiletries were the nicest Ive seen and were restocked daily  The complementary breakfast was to die for   melt in your mouth fresh pastries along with a hot item from the menu the crepes were divine and the best hotel coffee I have ever had  Dinner at Les Ramparts in the hotel was a bit stuffy and expensive with somewhat spotty service  There are much less expensive restaurants in the area with better service and comparable quality of food  The hotel staff was very helpful and although English was sometimes an issue they were never hhty or rude as some other Quebecoix we met during our stay  
P => What a wonderful place We loved this hotel  Stayed in a room with a waterfront view a must where the tall windows open letting in fresh air and allowing you to sit at the window put your feet on the low sill sip wine listen to music on the in room CD and watch the water and the activity in the waterfront park below  The food in the hotels restaurant Les Ramparts was excellent and all the hotel staff were friendly and helpful  Everything in Old Montreal is within walking distance  You cant go wrong here  Enjoy 
P => Very charming I stayed here the for  nights in one of the queen rooms and it was very charming  The building is old but it has been restored very nicely and keeps its character  The rooms are big with wood floors and high ceilings and I love how the walls have some exposed brick  You feel like you are in the s when you are staying here  Aside from the rooms the hotel is rather small   especially the lobby and the service is not great but it is fine  There is a nice view from the rooftop bar but I understand it is only open seasonally  The location is fantastic right on the main street in the Old Port area of Montreal  You can walk to many restaurants and along the river or just stroll around the Old Town  I actually proposed to my wife just outside the hotel  It was very romantic and she loved it  The only drawback is you have to walk several blocks to get to the subway or take a cab to get to downtown Montreal  
P => Auberge du Vieux Port   a very nice place to stay Stayed at the Auberge for a couple of days at the start of ch on the strength of previous Trip Advisor reviews  Must say I wasnt disappointed  The staff were really friendly and helpful the room was spacious and we loved the huge bed wooden floorboards exposed bricks and beams  The wine and cheese each evening were a nice touch the breakfast was just right  Perfectly located for exploring the old town and only  minutes walk to the metro station  Would recommend a stay  
P => Phenomenal Rooms romance romance and romance My wife and I drove up from NJ to spend Valentines weekend at the Auberge du Vieux Port  I found the hotel online and thought Id take a chance  The hotels strength is its rooms  We had a king room facing the river and it was absolutely amazing  The room features a ceiling that is a good  or ft high w huge exposed beams enormous floor to ceiling windows and gorgeous wood trim around everything  The bathroom has a stand up shower as well as a large Jacuzzi tub  It really was a perfect room for a romantic weekend  The staff at the Auberge du Vieux Port was great   very friendly and helpful and in once instance even refused a well earned tip  They own a few other hotels and restaurants in the area and have an obvious incentive to send you to their other properties when you ask for restaurant advice   just something to keep in mind  Their other properties seemed wonderful as well  You can walk to anything in quotOld Montrealquot  A taxi downtown will take less than  minutes and will cost be   There are dozens of shops and restaurants within a block or two of the hotel  There is also a fantastic outdoor ice skating rink about  yards away  Lastly there is a restaurant in the basement called something like quotLes Rempartsquot   we bought a package with the hotel that included a  course meal at Les Remparts  Wow We were blown away  It was phenomenal  If you have romance in mind you will love the Auberge du Vieux Port   
P => Wonderful but not great location The hotel staff ambience are absolutely wonderful  Fantastic full breakfast  Well worth staying here unless you are planning to do a lot downtown and use the Metro  The old city is beautiful lots of great cafes and restaurants but few shops that are not complete tourist traps  Closest Metro is a  minute walk straight uphill  I spent most of the weekend downtown at museums etc  and found the hotel was not conveniently located  
P => Excellent Hotel My wife and I stayed in a street facing room on a top floor overlooking the river  Beautifully appointed room with wireless internet  One of the most confortable beds I have experienced  The staff is extremly conciencious and the all day car valet for  was a real plus unlimited in and out  The hotels location makes it very easy to venture out and explore all of Montreal or jump into the car to see the country  Having the restaurant in the basement of hotel made for a convenient and tasteful dining experience  The hotel offers a winecheese tasting at pm which seemed to work relative to the daily schedule  Overall it was a very pleaseant stay  
P => Very good   if you want to stay in Old Montreal I stayed in one of the lofts at this hotel which provide the space and privacy of your own loft with the back up of a full service hotel  But be warned the lofts are in arate buildings to the hotel and there are no lifts so you will have to walk up a few flights of stairs to get to your loft There were some minor details in the loft such as a chipped sink and broken desk drawers that the hotel should have identified and dealt with itself  The website also said there would be a DVD player in the room but there wasnt Check in was very efficient  The staff were friendly but professional  Breakfast was one of the best Ive experienced in a hotel and I wish British hotels particularly London business hotels would learn from this Ultimately the ision to stay here depends on whether you want to be in Old Montreal  It is an area for tourists rather than locals and you will either find the area very appealing think French town or want to avoid the area entirely  For me it was safe and secure and allowed us to walk around the area first thing in the morning before the area becomes very busy with tourists  
P => Outstanding Our two night here with a wonderful Haloween parade were all we wanted and expected  We would return and advise all of our friends to stay a this beautiful hotel with an excellent resturant and outstand services 
P => Excellent stay at Auberge du Vieux Port A charming hotel the Auberge du Vieux Port typifies the warm hospitality you would expect in a small hotel  It was intimate yet private with first class service and an abundance of amenities  Our tastefully appointed room was spacious comfy the perfect place to relax after a long day of sightseeing and shopping  The hotel also houses the Ramparts one of the best French restos in the town  A true jewel I highly recommend the hotel to everyone who likes small places  
P => fabulous quaint friendly staff we loved our    nite stay get the rooms that overlook the river high floor quieter  large rooms free high speed wireless internet tasty free breakfast served in their below ground cellar where they also host a daily free winecheese hour  attentive staff and easy walking distance to all sights we enjoyed tasty Indian and Polish restaurants nearby with many choices  loved the Botanical Gardens too but youll need car  Wed go back    
P => Hotel with a wow factor We spent three nights at the Auberge in tember   As an old warehouse the building  look a bit uninspiring from the outside but the interior makes up with bags of character in abundance  The st floor room with exposed brick walls and quality furnishings was quite special  A really comfortable bed fixed our jet lag  Service was excellent and the CD player with a good choice of CDs was a nice touch  Breakfast in Les Remparts was good and wholesome and always served with a smile The Auberge is well situated in the old town and easy to find even for us off a plane and the airport shuttle followed by a metro and a short walk  There are loads of excellent restaurants close by restaurant du vieux port is recommendedIts hard to criticise the Auberge   and it does not affect the excellent review  but the noise early in the morning from the cobbled street  worry some we lived with it because the quality of the room was so good  Someone also commented that you couldnt see out of the dirty windows   that was solved by opening the huge windows to give views of the port All the same this place is excellent and recommended  
P => Three Night Stay in ust My wife and I stayed at the Auberge the first week of ust based on the reviews here and the location  We were put in one of the larger rooms on the th floor towards the port the first night and in one of the rooms on the other side th floor the next two nights  The rooms were both large and very nice and the views on both sides were nice as well  I sleep soundly so no problems with noise plus we stayed up late enjoying the city  The beds were very comfy I do recommend taking one of the horse carriage tours  Our guide pointed out a lot of the sites to see cool bars and good restaurants  Unfortunately we didnt do that until the last night The location is great right in the middle of the old city with lots of things to see and do  A short taxi ride gets you to other sites in the city  We had breakfast each morning which was included in the room  Excellent breakfast  Service was good except one morning when one of the help didnt make it to work Montreal is a great city three nights is all you need  Its not Paris but its less than  hour away from NYC Definitely would recommend the Auberge  
P => Picture Perfect We stayed at the Auberge du Vieux Port for  nights at the end of y and loved it  Our room was on the fifth floor of the main building and we had no noise problems at all  The staff was always helpful and nice the food was excellent try the salads on the Terrasse if you dont mind the wind and the room was large and well appointed  Nothing beats a nice jacuzzi after a strenous day dining in cafes and strolling  Overall a wonderful stay with no compalints  Id stay there again without hesitation though from some of the other comments on the site Id recommend an upper floor in the main building like we had  You wont be disappointed  
P => Ditto to the Atlanta review We stayed for three nights in y and had virtually the same feelings as the Atanta reviewer  We were on a lower floor so the noise was a little more apparent but not bothersome at all  The serbice throughout the hotel was excellent with special mention to MatthewDavidChristine Kyle and ie P s For those non walkers such as us the valet parking is well worth the additional expense 
P => Very nice but noisy We stayed in the lofts which are located about  yards from the main hotel  It was huge Over  sq feet  The outer room had a fireplace and TV full kitchen with brand new equipment and lovely dining area  The bedroom had a comfortable king  sized bed and a large jacuzzi  The bath was slightly smaller but had a huge modern shower There were no elevators so we had to walk up  flights of stairs but it helped burn off those extra calories from desserts The staff was very friendly and helpful except for one of the concierge members who seemed not to know much of the city apart from the quotusualquot spots  The maid service was good  The breakfasts at the hotel each morning were very nice and there was complimentary wine and cheese each afternoon at  My only complaint was the noise  Each morning including the weekend there was construction noise garbage collectors etc outside  The windows must have been very thin because  floors up it was enough to awaken you  Also the ceiling transmitted the walking noises from the people above you the floors are all hardwood without carpettingOverall wed recommend the Auberge but if the were to do something about the noise Id return in a heart beat  
P => Wonderful We stayed at the Auberge du Vieux Port for five nights in y   In a word it is EXCELLENT We checked in near midnight and were greeted with a wonderful and charming evening concierge  He served us a welcoming glass of wine and the helped us to our room Our room was on the top floor overlooking the port Our room was lovely be French Provincial and not at all overdone The hardwood floors were authentic and the room had a slight slope to it which added to the charm  Our sleigh bed was wonderful too Two walls were completely brick and were real building walls  The bathroom came with deluxe soaps bath salts etc  and two terry robes and two pairs of slippers  We had generous windows which opened with which to look out at the port and hear the sounds outside  When these double paned windows were closed the room was almost soundproof  Although the terrace restaurant was above us we never heard it  Neither did we hear the elevator which was adjacent to our room as well On Saturday evening we went up to the terrace and watched fireworks with matching classical music provided by the auberge  The restaurant in which we ate breakfast is a real treat It serves both a continental and full breakfast  Some of the continental breakfast offerings were croissants yogurts cheeses nectars and juices fresh fruits chocolate pastries and gourmet granolas  Some of the hot breakfast offerings were French toast and crepes served with real Canadian maple syrup omelets Canadian smoked salmon deep fried bacon gourmet sausages wonderful ham delicious fluffy toast and seasoned potatoes  Everything was fresh and delicious hot and cold  Although the auberge is lovely if you must go outside the auberge is located in the center of Montreal s old port vieux port  The auberge is convenient to all of the old city including Notre Dame du Montreal and you can even walk to downtown within  minutes If you choose to stay in the auberge the whole time that is fine too  The rooms have a high quality stereo CD and radio TV and free wireless Internet  The staff was always courteous and frequently engaged us in conversation  We highly recommend the Auberge du Vieux Port in Montreal  
P => wonderful two night stay The main part of the hotel is gorgeous and our room was large and airy   loved the hardwood floors stone walls and jacuzzi There is some noise from the busy streets below but we were there mid week and were not bothered in the least  The hotel staff were unpretentious and friendly the restaurant provides delicious meals    my partner and I were overall delighted Highly recommended  
P => Excellent The Auberge is an excellent small hotelwith a very European feel Rooms are tastefully furnished windows open to let in street sounds if you like attentive service and complimentary full breakfast   
P => Excellent Hotel    I just returned from an excellent stay at this wonderful hotel  quotAubergequot means quotcountry innquot in french and that is the feel youll get when staying here     even though the hotel is centrally located in the tourist friendly Old Port area of Montreal between cobblestone streets  O K  so here are my observations  The room was excellent  Very comfortable beds and pillows  The hardwood floor was a nice touch and the room was very clean  In fact we arrived back to our room early one day and found the maid wet mopping the floor  We also enjoyed the jacuzzi bath  Our room faced Rue St  Paul in the back of the hotel fourth floor I requested a quiet room with two beds  For the most part it was quiet with the exception of our first night a Saturday     some clubrestaurant or be it was a band at the nearby plaza was playing music until late the bars close at  a m   The hotel is VERY centrally located to everything including the Metro  No car is necessary to see all of Montreal  Also the staff were excellent     always very courteous helpful and friendly  And the resturant in the cellar is also excellent  We particularly enjoyed the breakfasts each morning included in the price and the dinner we had there was truly wonderful  The bottom line is that if youre visiting Montreal as a tourist destination stay at this hotel You will not be disappointed  
P => Run Dont Walk   Away from this hotel It  sound romantic but be advised that a stay in this hotel is anything but    unless you like streets jammed shoulder to shoulder with bad b o  smelling tourists souvenir shops overpriced amp LOUSY restaurants that prey upon tourists construction noise freight train at am  hotel lofts are many stairs up dirtyampdusty miserable maid service and cockroaches  plus no amenities  need i say more 
P => Hell in auberge lofts and old Montreal we had not been to montreal for over a ade and were looking forward to our trip this summer   were we ever disappointed stay away from the lofts offered by the hotel even though they look AND SOUND cool in the online photos and in the pitch the hotel will give you when you call  more importantly DO NOT stay in old montreal    unless you like tee shirt and souvenir shops and enjoy being surrounded by quotmillionsquot of tourists mainly blue collar canadian familes and their kids the freight train that rolls through in the predawn hours bums sleeping on all the park benches beggars and the deafening sound of construction  Worse still are the sucker bait restaurants in Old Montreal that offer EXPENSIVE sub par and uninteresting meals    steak and fish etc  A ade or so ago Old Montreal made for an interesting half day stroll  but in that ade the properties have been bought up by shrewd entrepreneurs greeks and turned into a Times square of sorts  it will become the vacation from hell if you stay in the hotels lofts  you must walk up flights of stairs    tenement style   maid service is lousy rooms are dusty lip imprints on glasses roaches in the kitchen  They say wireless internet but thats only in the main hotel not the lofts  Everyone working for the hotel uses the stupid cliche no problemquot whenever you ask and then BEG for services you normally expect when you stay in a hotel that charges these premium rates  were shocked by the rave reviews for this hotel and wonder whether management is using shills   because the place is a disaster  montreal is a walking town which is wonderful  but the last thing you need at the end of the day are several flights of stairs facing you  moreover by the end of the day you want great restaurants a reasonable walking or cab distance away  this does NOT exist here  unless you want the environment of low class carnival    old montreal and horrible accomodations the lofts do yourself a favor and stay in a luxury high rise hotel with all the ameneties close to the higher class down town shopping areas sherbrooke for example and the better restaurants ps    if you are driving from the u s  DO NOT travel on a canadian or u s  holiday   we had to wait in a  mile back up of cars for THREE HOURS to get through canadian customs  
P => Honeymoon Spot We stayed here for a week on our honeymoon After looking at several inns on the web we settled on this one  We were not disappointed  The room was very well appointed and clean  The bathroom   with shower and jacuzzi was a romantic and welcome touch afer long days on walking tours  Great to soak and relax  The breakfasts were excellent and the wine and cheese a nice way to end the day and whet your appetite for dinner out  The staff was friendly and helpful  The room had a CD player ironironing boardTV and mini fridge too  The huge terry robes were a nice touch Yes the rooms can be noisey at least on the Rue St  Paul side in the morning w deliveries  Youre in the city   get over it However you can sit in the window seat and listen to street muscians watch people go by and see the night city lights in this vibrant section of Montreal  Many restaurants are within waking distance as is the Pavillion Jacque Cartier and the water front  We were there during Celefete and for Canada Day   the beginnning of the Montreal Jazz Festival  Lots to do and see  The inn is close to two metro stations as well  Next time we drive  We can not recommend taking Amtrak  Looking for a romantic pace to stay for your honeymoon We suggest Auberge du Vieux Port  
P => The people location food     heaven Forget the rumors of rude and unfriendly our long weekend at the Auberge    was wonderful  From the moment the taxi pulled up we were treated like royalty  Matthew amp Doug  were wonderful  The street noise is there but you wouldnt give up the sunrise over the river for the quiet  Breakfast was huge and delicious  Doris makes sure of that  Old Montreal is full of life and ambience  Truly a wonderful experience  When was the last or first time you bought the pillows when you left  
P => Most Romantic Stay I visited Auberge du Vieux Port in  of   It was a wonderful experience  It s great to sit at the window with a glass of Champaign and watch people waking in the Old Montreal  Service was exceptional and wine and cheese afternoon break reminded me of Paris  The oversized windows just gave an additional charm to the rustic feeling of the room  
P => It was great  My wife and I stayed at the Auberge du vieux port for  nights  We found the staff to be very friendly and attentive and the breakfasts were great  We also enjoyed the afternoon wine and cheese tastings  We found the room to be very good the bed was comfortable the bathroom modern and clean  We had some noise from the street outside our room faced the street and the roads are cobblestone but we slept wonderfully  I dont know why the complaint about the lobby in the hotel being small  How much time are you going to spend in the lobby We also did not get any smell of burnt onions or any other foods from the restaurant  I found the hotel to be very central in Old Montreal we walked almost everywhere and there is a metro station about  blocks away  We had a wonderful dinner at the Mondvie got a table right by the band and next to a window without even asking for it  The food was delicious and the band was great  When we go back to Montreal we will stay at the Vieux port again  
P => Run Dont Walk To This Charming Hotel My husband and I took advantage of Auberge du Vieux Port Jazz weekend  What a fabulous take this is  The rooms are charming the staff the most pleasant we have encountered in a long time the breakfasts included sumptuous  But not to be missed is dinner at their famous restaurant   Les Remparts   and dinner and an evening of jazz at their jazz restaurant Modavie  The location is perfect for exploring art galleries museums boutiques   all on a winters day  And to get oriented for those who have never been to this charming area of Montreal take a horse drawn carriage ride around the neighborhood  Make your reservations now for a fabulous weekend get away  
P => Simply vellous Charming clean and spacious room with antique looking furniture yet equipped with all modern amenities CD player safe jacuzzi Frette towels and robes    Staff is very attentive and quotrealquot  Dinner at the restaurant is a must  This little gem lives up to its reputation  Woudnt stay anywhere else in Montreal  
P => A Delicious Experience The Auberge is wonderful and the restaurant is exceptional romantic and delicious We had a wonderful time  Stay here  
P => a little gem in the heart of old Montreal A wonderful discovery in a delightful vibrant location  Staff were very friendly and courteous at all times and offered helpful advice whenever we asked about local restaurants etc  This is a small hotel with excellent accomodation and no pretentious staff  Bigggest bathroom and bedroom we had encountered throughout our three week holiday in Canada and we had been to Calgary Rockies Vancouver and Quebec staying in  star hotels  So great to have a arate and large shower at last and not one over the bath We were on the fifth floor overlooking St Pauls and there was a little noise but the lovely very comfortable beds ensured a sound nights sleep  Breakfast was good and it was a nice touch to offer wine and cheese late afternoon   much appreciated after a long day out and before the evening stroll and meal  Small but interesting rooftop barcafe with prompt service  Went to the restaurant one of the evenings and had a very pleasant meal with good service  Would definetly return and hopefully have a view of the river next time  Thanks for a memorable and very comfortable three nights 
P => A jewel of a hotel close to everything The Auberge du Vieux Port is a true jewel of a hotel in the heart of old Montreal and close to everything I stayed there with my husband on our honeymoon in ember in a great water view room with King Bed double jacuzzi and a huge bath exposed brick walls hardwiood floors and a super sound system from the in room CD player  Returned in ch with sister and cousin and stayed in a back room with a rollaway  Room was darker and noisy when the bars closed around  am but we all loved the location  This was my third time and I will always stay there when I return to Montreal   summer or winter 
P => Romantic  My family recently spent  nights at the auberge  We found the hotel to be charming and romantic  The or was beautiful and the location was great for people who like to wander window shop and eat at outdoor cafes  The lobby is a bit small the lobby at the sister Hotel Nelligan is more impressive but we found the staff to be geniunely helpful and caring  When we inquired about a particular popular restaurant that we had heard of the desk clerk not only provided us with helpful infomation but she also offered to make our reservation  The room was huge and well appointed  Walking into the room for the first time we found a modern JVC CDradio playing classical music  Nice touch The bathroom had a jacuzzi amp a shower and was stocked with a robe and slippers for each of us  There was a complimentary breakfast buffet amp service as well as afternoon wine amp cheese  The room tended to be noisy in the early morning because of deliveries being made at local businesses but overall we highly recommend the auberge without reservation

P => A very enjoyable stay in a great hotel  Ideal location extremely friendly and helpful staff  Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for someplace small and romantic in a great location and for a good value  
P => Charming Auberge near the Latin Quarter and Mont Royal I had a difficult time finding a place to stay in Montreal but I am extremely happy that I ended up at the Auberge le Pomerol  Situated just   blocks from St Denis its a perfect place to stay if you want to visit some of the many excellent restaurants in the area many of which are APP bring your own wine  Its also walking distance to Old Montreal and the Contemporary Art Musuem  The Auberge itself is very homey while being very eclectic and contemporary  Our room was moderately sized with a large bathroom that included a two person sized spa tub  Breakfast was included   each morning we received a little case with a croissant a piece of fruit an orange juice a yogurt and a couple of oatmeal cookies  They also serve free snacks in the afternoon   cheese and crackers cookies and fruit  The auberge is reasonably priced but it is not a full service hotel  There is no room service no porters no dining room or bar  However if you are looking for a great base from which to explore the east side of the city and old Montreal the Auberge de Pomerol is quite nice  
P => Happy with the Pomerol Stayed for one night at the centrally located Pomerol  The personnel was nice the room the quotexecutivequot one was very comfortable   and yes the jacuzzi was working fine  There was a flatscreen tv set a stereo an alarm clock everything but the bathrobe  We didnt have a nice view but that was not important  It is close to the bus terminal the Latin quarter and the Village so there are plenty of great food and entertainment options  Continental breakfast was included not the best croissants in town but with jam cheese coffee yougourt etc   For  a night its a very good deal  
P => Nice hotel great Location We stayed at the Pomerol for  nights last week  The staff were nothing but courteous  Our room an economy room with  twins was small but designed efficiently  The bathroom was sparkling clean  We liked the idea of our complimentary continental breakfast being delivered to our room each morning  The hotel also offers free snacks in the afternoon but we were never around to take advantage of this  The only complaint I would have although it did not really concern us   so it is more like a warning is that the twin beds are arranged so they are touching and you cant move them apart  This could be awkward if you were sharing with someone you didnt know very well  Other than that our stay was pretty much perfect  Only  blocks from St Denis very close to Ste Catherine and right across the street from  metro lines Berri UQAM Metro station  Some reviews complained of homeless people   yes we saw some near the Bus Depot at Berri and Maisoneuve but it was no worse than any other North American city  We were not approached or hassled once  Its a sad and unfortunate thing but there are bound to be homeless people in any large city and complaining about them when they do nothing to harm us is nothing but rude  Montreal is a lovely city and next time I visit I would definitely stay here again  
P => My Favourite I have stayed a few times in Montreal and for now the Pomerol is my personal favourite The Auberge is well situated directly in downtown near the Village just in front of a major subway station and at  minutes walking from the bus station  The Pomerol is quite small but the interior is well designed so it doesnt feel tiny at all only cozy  We have been welcome with kind polite and competent staff  But the greatest surprise was when we opened our bedrooms door our superior room oration was just perfect  So far away from a lot of kitsch hotel and inn that I have seen before  Everything is very modern and custom made for the Pomerol  I even threatened the staff that I would have to steal their painting because I wouldnt be able to find it anywhere else We went back to the front desk and the receptionist offered me to visit the other rooms what I did I work for a kind of travel agency  To be honest the economic rooms are a bit small but look good anyway  But the regular and superior rooms are worth the  or  bucks more  And the executive are just mind blowing  Most of the rooms have a little fridge and plasma television with a DVD player where you can also listen to music  After a free snack offered by the hotel until late in the evening in the guest kitchen including cookies cheese coffee tea and other we went to a comfy night of sleep  The breakfast in the morning is a little light but good  Muffin crescent jam cheese coffee all at your front door when you wake up  So no need to hurry and dress up before you go out to eat You have the chance to be lazy    So overall the Pomerol was responsible for a great romantic get away in Montreal 
P => Great staff We stayed at the Pomerol while in Montreal for the Grand Prix  It was one of the few hotels that had rooms left  While it is not in the nicest section of downtown Montreal the hotel itself is very nice  It is very small but has charm  They only had the ecomonic rooms left which are very small but clean and orated nicely  The staff really made the place  The two women who were at the front desk went out of their way to be helpful even letting us stay beyond our checkout time at no extra charge  They have a small kitchen stocked with cheese crackers cookies coffee etc  from  p m  until  p m  A very nice touch  The subway is right across the street and the walk to old Montreal takes about   minutes  
P => Just what I was looking for I was nervous reading the reviews on this site but I couldnt have been happier with our stay The price was great  Granted it was in the middle of winter and over Easter weekend but this room was a steal  Furthermore if you are on a tight budget you could EASILY save money on breakfast and lunch by eating the hotel breakfast and snacks  The breakfast consists of a croissant another type of pastry muffin or danish a yogurt a piece of fruit a package of cheese and a drink    PER PERSON  The snacks that appear around pm include several types of cookies a cheese platter crackers and dried fruits  Plus they have bread and peanut butter and jelly in the kitchen at all times of the day  Now hopefully you get to sample the delicious food in Montreal but if you really wanted to save money on food this would be a good choice to stay The location was perfect  Its a block from St  Denis which is covered in restaurants  And its right across the street from the Metro  One of the reviews here said it was a block away    not true  Its directly across the street The staff was friendly but only somewhat helpful  They did not offer many recommendations like one of the reviews said  I also got the quotgo to st  Denis for foodquot recommendation that someone else mentioned  Also it seems like the package they offer for the Botanical Gardens and Biodome is  more than what you can buy if you actually go to the Biodome to purchase tickets We stayed in an executive suite and it was pretty nice  I travel quite frequently and frankly a room is a room to me unless its a really BAD room  This room was probably above average because of the jacuzzi tub we had that we used every night  The bathroom is pretty small but not a big deal to me  The room was a ent enough size for my tastes  Compared to a room at say a Fairmont hotel its much smaller and we got the big room but like I said its just a place to sleep really There is a lounge downstairs with a computer and a fireplace  Wireless internet available free with no password  Restaurant right next door connected to the hotel  Walls were a little thin but not a big problem  I could hear our neighbors TV at one point during the night but nothing woke me up Overall I would DEFINITELY recommend the place and I would ABSOLUTELY stay here again if I come back to Montreal  
P => Wouldnt return Stayed here for two nights and would not return for several reasons  The neighborhood although probably safe is unappealing  Many down and out folks on the streets  Nothing to recommend the buildings and stores nearby  When I returned at PM one night I asked about where I could eat at that time and was told to go over to rue St  Denis and I could probably find someplace  I think that a hotel should have more knowledge of what is available and I had been along St  Denis and knew that I would not easily find a place close by  I ended up walking around and found a ent hamburgerpizza place a block away but not towards St  Denis  There were other restaurants in that direction too and Id expect management to be aware of them but they seemed not to be  Looking back I think that I got what I paid for considering that Montreal is an expensive large city  The room was OK for one and the complimentary breakfast was good  The Metro is a block away and can get you anywhere in the city  I do not speak French but everyone including the parking attendent was helpful and friendly  
P => Lovely Auberge Fair Location We overnighted in Montreal at the Auberge Le Pomerol  Boul  De Maisonneuve in y   Our very clean beautifully orated and comfortable room had a king bed large flat panel TV and a Sony radio that was several grades above standard hotel issue  A large jetted tub in the modest size bathroom and remote for the AC capped off the feeling of small space luxury  The inn provides some nice touches  Breakfast appears   breads cheese juice yogurt  in a closed basket hung on a hook outside your room  Cookies dried fruits and other light snacks are available gratis in a downstairs room until  PM  We met only friendly and helpful staffers We reserved the same day with the front desk at the very good price of  plus taxes using a quotlast minutequot promo code obtained from Tourisme Montreal   Free use of an off site gym was included but we lined  Parking is available in a private lot right behind the hotel at night  For us the biggest but not too bad negative was the location  Although there are stores and restaurants close to the hotel Old Montreal is not  It took these two seniors about  minutes to walk to Old Montreal passing a scruffy panhandler along the way  Brisk walkers could cut that time in half  A desk clerk advised us not to walk too far towards the left out of the hotel because there is not too much good to see  Being native New Yorkers we accept local quotgood sensequot restrictions as part of life in any large city  A subway is very close and taxis are always an option  A very minor inconvenience is the few steps down from the tiny lobby to the elevator  The staff willingly helps with your bags if you ask  My wife and I highly recommended this inn for leisure travelers except for those who prefer to be closer to the old city  We very much enjoyed our brief stay  
P => Very nice week end I stayed at Le Pomerol over the long week end in ober I love the room it was very clean and the employees were very polite and very professionnal  The service at the front desk was excellent  The price were very reasonable and the location was great for shopping  
P => We enjoyed but the price was a little too much My husband and I stayed at Le Pomerol over the long weekend in yust  We loved our luxury room though it was on the pricy side considering the lack of quotextrasquot at the hotel  For my husband amp I we really wanted to have romantic surroundings which definitely was the case  We loved the contemporary or On that point this hotel won hands down   its very well styled  BUT given the price we paid I had to pick quotAVERAGEquot for its review This hotel is like a boutique hotel and though there is wireless internet available for all the rooms I would think that this hotel would be better suited for couples over business travellers  The hotel is ideally situated   close enough to walk to a LOT of interesting places restaurants bars amp Old Montreal not to mention that the METRO is right across the street from the hotel  If you dont need the hotel extras and enjoy being in the right location then this is the hotel for you A big downside to the hotel as one of the other reviews mentioned is that there are no services available other than basic maid service  I would also have to agree that given the nightly rate we paid our expectations were not quite met either  Still it is a large city hotel and the price was quotreasonablequot considering but for the same amount of money Ill stay elsewhere next time without the pretty or perhaps but WITH all the extras that one enjoys of a hotel  
P => An experience to remember I have been coming to Montreal many times on business trips and tried many hotels  A friend suggested this Bed and Breakfast which turned out to be one of my best experiences in this city The location is perfect Close enought to downtown and Old Montreal which makes after work more ineresting The room in which I stayed offered style and comfort  The continental breakfast displayed variation  The free internet connection is a plus for people on business trips needing to keep in touch with the office The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and cleanleness of the room The friendly service makes it all that much more enjoyable 
P => Ultra modern but NOT ultra comfortable My wife and I stayed at Le Pomerol and had a very substandard experience  We were given one of the smallest rooms with only a double bed not even an alarm clock and a bathroom smaller than most closets  Being a seasoned traveler and worked in the service industry we had the internet reservation handy  I told them there must be a mistake which they denied  After some time of sorting out the issue we were given the proper room which was much nicer in most respects including basic immenities that were absent in the first room  The ultra modern or is interesting and shows some attention to detail although one aspect might be luxurious many details of or and service are missing  The beds were very firm and the rooms showed wear and tear although kept clean This establishment is far from a luxury hotel or a place for corporate travelers to feel comfortable doing business  The facilities are overstated in the advertisements and pictures are taken at very opportune angles  There are no services available other than basic maid service  The restaurant onsite is not run by the hotel and while offering a discount for guests was unwilling to serve us at pm and only serve yourself breakfast items were available aside from the restaurant  The internet connection did not work in our room preventing needed work from being done  I must say the staff were all friendly and helpful but the expectations presented in their advertising and high rates approach false advertising  Well pay the same money and stay at a much nicer facility next time 
P => stylish little hotel We stayed in Montreal for  days in ch   Auberge Le Pomerol is convenietly located just couple minutes walk from bus station  The pictures of hotel on line turned out to be true  contemporary nice new furniture styly orations rooms and bathrooms are very clean nice breakfast excellent coffee good choice of pastries and jogurt  First night we stayed in a bigger room with double jacuzzi TV and stereo system  It was great  Another night we were in a standard room which was smaller but not any worse than a bigger one  Auberge has its little rustic restaurant with great service  Rue St  Denis is close with variety of cafe and restaurants  People were so friendly everywhere  Great romantic city I was in Paris this summer and I thought that Montreal was very much Canadian quotParisquot  
P => Great place  This Hotel is a great place to stay  Its clean the breakfast is fresh and offer many choice even if its a continental breakfast  The employee are very polite and professionnal and the service is excellent  It was excellent I recommand it to anybody  
P => Enjoyed Auberge Le Pomerol My Husband Son and I stayed at the BampB this past e  We have been to various hotels in BC and ON California and NY and Greece  This was one of the best accommodations weve experienced  Stylish rooms friendly service at breakfast time reasonably priced and the restaurant was excellent Convenient location though neighborhood is transitioning  They made a mistake by not mentioning that only children older than  yrs  old are allowed but made an exception with our young Son they already took our reservation  
P => Great place great location  I stayed at this BampB last ust and loved it  The ambience is great the price was reasonable and the location is perfect We stayed in one of the regular rooms   it was average size but very nicely furnished  Across the street was a metro station which made getting around very easy  Breakfast was nice and there was an internet connection available free if you needed to check email or check out restaurants to eat at The location is very close to the old part of the city but it is also right on the edge of the quotVillagequot which is a little funky  Its not threatening or unsightly but some people dont care for that kind of thing so I thought I would point it out Would I go to this BampB again Absolutely I intend to  
P => excellent h tel  
P => 
P => Great Experience Clean and Cheap Easy to book great location Highly recommended 
P => Great Location Clean Rooms Good Value I stayed at the YWCA Hotel Montreal  They run a hostel too  Its got a great location for visiting Downtown Montreal and even Vieux Montreal if you dont mind the walk almost  min but lots of sights  You can walk to a variety of different restaurants at night  The rooms are clean and basic and service is good  There is a restaurant in the lobby breakfast is not included  The rates are fantastic for a big city  and the proceeds support YWCA programs so that is a nice bonus  Its a quiet hotel and they have lots of tourist information and can help with anything you ask  The restaurant for breakfast is okay  Oh if you stay out past  they lock the doors and you have to ring a bell to get in FYI  Great stay on a budget in the heart of the city  
P => Good value We stayed in this hotel in Montreal for one night  We had one of the cheap rooms with shared bathroom  The room was clean with a TV and air conditioning  It was comfortable but not attractive  We were happy with the room for the price  The one real problem is with the bathroom and shower facilities  Theres no problem with this as far as the ladies are concerned but for men things are much more grim  The mens bathroom is dark and dirty and you should be prepared to wait for your turn almost every time you visit  The shower room is a little better but it too gets messy quickly  Heres my top tip if you get fed up with waiting for the bathroom and eventually you will theres another one on the ground floor  Its the only additional one I could find  Or even better pay a little more and go for a room with a private bathroom Or even better than that forget about staying in a hotel and book into one of the many good BampBs in Montreal for the same price 
P => Great budget hotel I stayed at the Montreal Y hotel when I went to a conference in Monteal in e of   I highly recommend this place to travellers who look for an inexpensive and ent place to stay  I showed my student ID to the cashier and got   off In general the area is pretty safe  The location is central close to tons of restaurants bars and shops  Theres a metro stop a few blocks away  The room that I stayed had a private bath  It looks like that the hotel is recently renated  Everything looks new Both the room and the bathroom were very cean and comfortable  The room was very quie  Theres a TV set in the room  Also an ice machine down the hall way  There are a microwave pots and pans in their kitchen theres a superket just blocks away where you could prepare your meals  The kitchen is clean and has lots of sun light  Also free use of the YMCA gymThe only downside is that theres no wireless internet access inside the hotel  
P => 
P => Great Location I stayed here  nights on a personal visit  I booked it through Expedia  I paid AU  including taxes for the  nights  The location was exactly where I wanted to be which is the main reason I chose it  The entrance is a bit odd  From the street you go though doors and down half a flight of stairs  What you see from the street is a hair dressing salon  The entrance to the hotel lobby is to the right of the salon  The lobby is incrediably tacky 
P => Location location location Best Western Europa is located in the heart of downtown Montreal close to lots of shopping restaurants and of course the Bell Centre  If you are planning to get out and keep busy seeing the sights this hotel is great  If you want a large luxurious room to spend a bunch of time in you might want to choose another hotel gtRooms are very very small  Not only the actual room but the bathroom is tiny as well  Relatively clean although while we were getting ready to check out we found an old black banana peel  Elevators are also small  No issue with noise we found the rooms to be quiet  gtStaff is polite helpful when asked gtRestaurant in lobby Chez Cora serves breakfast and was good but long lineups on weekends  As noted above lots of restaurants within walking distance to choose from as well For us the price was reasonable and the location was superb  We dont spend a whole lot of time in the room on trips so we would consider staying here again next time we visit  Metro station is also close by so getting elsewhere in the city Old Montreal ect  is very simple  
P => Tiny rooms tinier washrooms horrible service I am not sure why this hotel has good reviews Small smelly rooms  Tinier washroom  Horrible service We checked into the hotel because I have stayed at other Best Western hotels and this is nothing like them  Compared to this Best Western the other Best Western hotels were luxury hotelsI am writing this review from the hotel room Our room was so small only one of us could move in the little space between our bed and the TV The washroom was so tiny that you would have to sit on the edge of the pot so that your knees dont bang against the wall The exhaust in the washroom gave both of us a terrible headache  The washroom did not have sufficient toiletries for  people so I called the front desk  It took me more than  hour to have  extra towel soap and shampoo sent up to the room  Basically   a very disappointing experience  I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Clean hotel good value My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by this hotel  Ups Clean comfortable hotel  Good location and close to both the green and orange subway lines  Great valueDowns The location is convenient but we ended up trekking to other neighborhoods most of the time  The service is disappointing   staff was either unfriendly or inexperienced  Our single King room was right by the elevator and I heard all the people walking by  Maid service came at an alarming AM waking us up way too early Even with all the downsides the hotel is a great value  
P => Great Location  Its very true   the rooms are TINY  But they are clean the shower has lots of hot water and its  the rate of any other hotel downtown So if you are enjoying Montreal and just in the room to sleep you wont mind the small rooms The location alone is fantastic right next to shops on St  Catharines St and a couple blocks away from the pubs on Crescent  Also only a min walk from old Montreal  
P => Good Location Run Down Hotel We stayed at the Best Western Europa hotel on Drummond Street y     The hotel was in a great location right in the centre of everything  It was within walking distance to the Metro station shopping and tourist attractions  The staff at the hotel went to great lengths to assist us in whatever we needed My problem was with the room  We stayed in  and let me tell you this room was very basic  The carpet is worn out and looks dirty  The air conditioner was really loud and every time the compresser went on and off it banged  This went on through the entire night  The bathroom has to win an award for the worst layout I have ever seen  The toilet is so close to the door that when you are sitting your knees are actually touching the bathroom door The hotel restaurant has closed and a Coras has opened up next door with a very limited menu  We went up to have a look at the spa area which opened up to replace the roof top pool  The floor were all cracking and there were actually holes in the walls  In my opinion this hotel is in serious need for some renations  The front lobby looks great but the rest of the hotel needs some work  
P => Nice Hotel   Fantastic Location Came to Montreal for the weekend to visit some friends and booked into the Best Western Europa last minute  The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment I arrived and the hotel has a nice up scale feel The room was incredibly small and I could not imagine sharing it with another person but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable   I really didnt need any more than that  Plus it included free wireless internet which really came in handy  The restaurant in the lobby served a great breakfast but its the location that makes this hotel a real winner Just steps from St  Catherine Street it is right in the middle of the shopping district during the day and the club district for nightly entertainment  There are fantastic restaurants of all kinds every where and many attractions and museums all with in walking distance  As well Old Montreal is only about a   min walk away  And considering the price I paid for the room the Europa is a terrific deal It was a great choice for me and Ill definitly stay here again next time Im in town 
P => Good place to stay although nothing amazing good location and relative good service  The room are in line with what we can expect from this chain  
P => Bad breakfast Nice hotel and location but the breakfast   If they call a very small glass of orange juice a slice of bread and a glass of coffee breakfast    
P => Great Location We really enjoyed our stay here at the Best Western Europa  It was centrally located and very close to the VIA station for you train riders If you like the clubbing area and brand name shops then this place is for you  If you like the Europe feel and want to venture over to Old Montreal its about a  min walk  There is also Saint Laurent and that is about a  min walk away  Really great places  Really nice hotel  Also very affordable for the location Thanks 
P => Great Location For Nightlife This hotel is on the corner of Rue Drummond and St  Catherine Ouest only  blocks from Rue Crescent where there are great restaurants and bars including Grumpys The Hard Rock and Saturdays  The staff is very friendly at the front desk  Theres an ATM right in the lobby for quotre fuelingquot stops  Parking is right across the street but I have experienced vandalism in the lot so you might want to look for alternative parking  The rooms are fairly small with a definite quotEuropeanquot feel right down to the narrow hallways  But everything was very clean Theres a quotpoolquot on one of the higher floors but I found it very small  Fortunately I think Im the only one who knows its there as Ive never seen anyone else in it I would recommend this hotel for a budget traveller who wants a home base for the quotSt  Catherines Scenequot  
P => Great Hotel at a Terrific Location I have stayed at this hotel three times over the past  years and each time I have come back priily because of this hotels terrific location  All rooms I have had were quite ent only one of them was on the small side  Service has overall been good only once I came across an uncooperative front desk person  Overall though I would definitely come back to this hotel  
P => Just dandy I booked the Europa as part of a reasonably priced airfare  hotel package  Based on prior reviews I wasnt expecting much from the Europa  The place isnt fancy and the lobby area looks a little dated but thats a really about the only flaw I found a ver minor one at that  I was surprised to get a spotlessly clean spacious modern room  It looked like it had just been remodeled and refurnished the day before  Everything in the room worked perfectly including the air conditioning and the free wireless internet both of those are always a hit or miss propositions  I didnt have many occasions to request assistance from the staff but the few times I did everything was chop chop thats a good thing  Also the location was perfect for my needs  I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing basic but comfortable accommodations in downtown Montreal  
P => Small rooms We had a four night stay at this hotel recently  The room that we were checked into was very small with little room in which to store luggage  The corridors are also narrow adding to the claustrophobic feeling  The location is handy with the metro and many shopping areas just a short stroll away  Unfortunately for us there were inconsiderate guests staying and we were woken at am  I would not recommend the hotel for long stays  
P => Great Location Good Price I made a last minute ision to visit Montreal and had a difficult time finding an affordable hotel that was in a great location with great reviews  I found it at Best Western  You can walk to Crescent St  where all the bars and clubs are at plus its a block away from Rue St  Catherine  If you want to visit St  Laurent Blvd  or Old Montreal take a cab or the Metro  The staff was friendly and helpful the place was clean and my room was quiet  The room is smaller than your standard American hotel but if youre in Montreal you shouldnt be spending much time in your room  I would definitely recommend this place  
P => It is a good hotel in a great location It is a good hotel in a great location Steps to shopping museums and attractions Try Spa Orange located at the th floor  It is a must foe every spa traveler an full service spa with great amenities and many services  We tried sabai stone massage asia couple and it was paradise  
P => You get what you pay for at this hotel My room seemed to be a closet converted into a room  Very small  For instance when sitting on the toilet my knees were mushed into the bathtub  I am not sure if all rooms are the same but I found this amusing The hotel is a great location   very close to the Bell Centre and St Catherines street  It is very close to the Metro as well  It is also next door to a fire station so at points in the night you will hear sirens  Because of the close proximity to St Catherines Street the hotel got pretty noisy on Friday night when some people enjoying the nightlife came back to their room I would say this could be a great affordable hotel for some and a below average hotel for others   it all depends on if you are in Montreal to go out and adventure or not  
P => Great Location I booked  rooms in this hotel for a family trip to Montreal  We stayed there  nights and overall Im happy with the ision to choose this hotel  The hotel structure is old but in good condition and present great value for the money The best thing about this hotel is the location  If you plan to spend time in downtown Montreal there is no better place  You are just off rue Sainte Catherine St  Catherine Street   Montreal th Ave  and all major shopping and entertainment attractions The rooms we stayed at were clean and tidy  Check in and check out was quick and staff was friendly upon requests for extra towels The hotel has an adjacent restaurant where we had breakfast we didnt use the hotel Bar and Restaurant as Im sure the options around were much better On the downside I have to mention that the mattress and pillow were not very comfortable in all rooms      all double beds rooms and the drainage of the bath was very slow  TVs are small and picture in some channels was grainy no special kids channels only in the morning I would certainly recommend this hotel for the budgeted traveller who can compromise some in room pleasure for the great location and cost  
P => Great Location This hotel is in a perfect location if you are planning on hitting up shopping on St  Catherine Street and the BarsClubs on Cresent  My room  had two double beds and was rather large  My friends were in  and it was slightly smaller but still a ent size  My room was at the end of a hallway so not too noisy  The service at the front desk was friendly and helpful  
P => Good hotel great location The hotel is located about  minutes in taxi from the airport  The staff was great the hotel rooms were a good size for  people  Very clean rooms nice views  We went to see our Atlanta Thrashers play the Canadians at Centre Bell and it was a block from the hotel which was perfect  The hotel lobby was orated very nice also  Great choice 
P => Bettern than the typical Best Western in the US ROOMWe had a queen bedroom at the end of the hallwayand the room was super smallIve never stayed at the such a small hotel room before But it was quite clean and furnitures were good  Definately not the cheap kind  I loved the beddings as well  Mattress was firm andsheets were clean The room did have a coffee maker and condiments and  mugs  They prodvided a free wireless internet service but you need to get the access code from the front desk Bathroom was clean and nice LOCATIONAwesome location Its in the middle of the downtown shopping area and the Metrosubway is only   blocks away There also is a hair salon and and Cora restaurant for breakfast amp dinner on the lobby  We had a breakfast at the Cora and it was very satisfying  I highly recommendThey do have a fitness center along with their new Spa facility PARKINGThere is a public paid parking lot across from the hotel andit was  for hours  Its an outdoor parking but it was safe enough GETTING AROUNDAfter getting some informations from the front deskthey are very helpful we immediately went out to take the Metro to get to the Old City  Metro was   per person one way  We had to transfer to another train after  stops but it was very easy to transfer once you follow the signs  I think it took us less than min to get to the old city area by Metro  It was a good experience SHOPPINGWhen I asked the front desk staff the hours for the undergroundshopping he said am pm  But I guess that was only during the weekdays We were there on saturday and all the shops were closed by pm  That was very disappointing  
P => great service but terrible smoking problem I stayed at the Best Western Europa for a dance seminar and show  We were there for two nights  The hotel has a beautiful lobby with several restaurants  Chez Cora is a breakfast lunch place that is quite good with good service  Therew as also a Chinese restaurant and the Oasis cafe  The included breakfast was no longer included or served starting with the weekend we arrived they no longer do a continental breakfast  This was a surprise as their website indicated that they did have one The room was not too small  It had two double beds no view and a reasonable bathroom  The bathroom amenities were average for this type of hotel  There were plenty of towels and pillows and the room was the right temperature We did have a problem that the room was quite smelly  We had requested a non smoking room but it was clear that people had been smoking in our room in the past  Across the hall two men were smoking all night in their non smoking room  When they opened the door it set off the fire alarm waking us all up at am  When I got home my spouse asked if I had been with a smoker as my clothing smelled  The stuffed animal I brought with me also had obtained a disgusting aroma  I know that cigarettes and Montreal are like New York and bagels but it is unfair to make a room non smoking and then have it not be  My friend is allergic to cigarette smoke and she started to develop a rash The services at the hotel for our event were quite good  The food was good at the buffet  I enjoyed buying drinks from their extremely hot bartender with his adorable ponytail  The staff at the hotel is very friendly and welcoming  
P => Comfy  My boyfriend and I spent  nights at this hotel we booked it thru Bonjour Quebec an extremely helpful website and we were very happy with the room location and staff The bathroom is very small but spotless   we were walking distance to restaurants shopping and Mont Royal and easily took the Metro to other attractions    the staff was very friendly and helpful  The Restaurant inside the hotel Chez  served the best breakfast weve ever had at a ridiculous low price If you dont intend on spending alot of time in your room because it isnt roomy I highly recommend this hotel   
P => Would stay again If you plan to be out and about and are only staying a night or  this place is great  Location is excellent   just a half block away from Rue St  Catherine for plenty of shops great eateries and entertainment  The Old Port is about a  minute walk away  The rooms are definitely small so keep that in mind if youre staying a little longer and there are so many great restaurants and cafes nearby that I wouldnt bother booking with breakfast included  
P => Wouldnt Recommend Staying Here Stay Elsewhere Well for starters I booked my reservation for four people but along with the confirmation from the Best Western sent to my email it said that I could change the reservation anytime before Thursday ust    I did that at the end of y  seeing that one of the four people couldnt attend do to personal circumstances  Instead of keeping the two rooms I thought that I changed it to one room instead of the two rooms  I guess that once you book a room with the Best Western at the   you cant change the reservation that it says you can in your email to confirm the reservation so many days in advance  Totally disgusted by that part  Well we arrived on Friday ust   and they didnt have the one room that I thought was changed  They had the two rooms instead the original reservation for   a night at a total rate of   a piece  I was totally dissatisfied from my arrival  The rooms are on the very small side and if someone is walking around the bed from the window where the desk is someone had better sit down to let the person go by because there just isnt enough room for two people to go by each other at all  Dissatisfied The parking for the Best Western is across the street for  a day in a open parking lot I checked on my car the entire time because nobody was at the lot watching the cars  Especially when they arent responsible for what happens to your vehicle  Then on Friday ust   sometime after our arrival we were sent a notice under both of our doors that we would be getting the breakfast in the morning from am am for the following morning  Well when we got there on Saturday ust   we were told that we didnt pay for the breakfast with the room  How much does a person have to pay extra to get a complientary breakfast in Montreal with the room In the United States it comes with the room last time I checked in the area that I live in and a much nicer breakfast from what I was told by my dhter  What I saw at the breakfast wasnt something that I would ever pay for while traveling in my life  We all were disgusted by this and we moved to a wonderful place Chez Cora on Rue Stanley were they serve wonderful breakfast at wonderful prices  If you go try the strawberrybanana smoothie as it comes with a strawberry and grapes for    We ate there every morning during our stay  Sunday ust   we started having a problem with our toilet in one of the rooms as it wouldnt flush  It didnt flush the rest of the time while we were there  Also during the whole stay we all had a hard time getting water to flow alot and didnt have much hot water so to speak of totally disgusted with the room and the price that I paid  When I checked out the Best Western Downtown Europa online at the beginning of the year  I thought that they had a pool they dont have a pool at all  Would of liked to have a pool after walking around seeing the sights all day while we were there  I guess they only have a fitness center and spa  After all the walking that you do why do you need to go to the fitness center at the Best Western I wouldnt recommend staying here in Downtown Montreal try staying some place else instead  
P => what a disappointment Ive stayed at numerous BW hotels across the USA and I would have to rate the Europa in Montreal as one of the worst BW hotel that Ive ever stayed in  Its true the roomsand bathroom are small but they are clean  The elevators take a very long time during checkout in the morning and are so small that its hard to fit two people including luggage  The photos on the the hotel website are very misleading but the worst part of my stay was the quotcontinental breakfastquot that was included in the rather expensive price of the room  I arrived at am for the breakfast which is served from am   am  The so called quotbreakfastquot was dismal to say the least  There was only one bagel left and hardly any other food at all I watched as a few other guests arrived after me looking for food and they looked as disappointed as I did The hotel was filled with students partying all night long as if it was spring break  For the same price I cant imagine anyone would stay here rather than one of the other hotels on Sherbrooke like the riott 
P => Great Place Location Price Service The hotel lobby is very uniquely designed the staff were extremely nice and helpful  Rooms are clean with new furniture Room was cleaned every day towels changed etc    very happy Location is fantastic   right on St  Catharines close to Place des Arts and all sorts of shops restaurants and entertainment very close to Peel subway station  Fantastic restaurants in the vicinityChecking out was also a pleasure   could safely store our luggage and go for a walk  Also on a budget esp  during jazz festival time when everything was overbooked and overpricedWould recomment and definitely come back 
P => Good location  We stayed at the hotel as part of a room block for a wedding from e      I had read some of the reviews and had some concerns about the size of the rooms location and customer service  We had a room with  double beds on the nd floor   The parents we were traveling with had a queen bed room also on the nd floor   Their bathroom was plenty big but Im not sure if its because I requested a bigger one  The reservationist indicated some were bigger  The bathroom in our room with  double beds was plenty big enough as well  Pros  Location was fantastic  Breakfast available  Free passes to Nautilus Plus gym around corner on St  Catherine since their gym is reating    Nautilus is an amazing gym so it worked out better  Gave us several options for where to park   parked in lot directly across from hotel which turned out to be fine safe  Rooms clean and AC unit worked  Good price ours was a little discounted bc of wedding block but not much  Big closet in double beds roomCons  Had to ask for extar towels a couple times  Vending machines kept running out of water  Room service is only an Asian restaurant  Kept running out of items and having to ask to refill them at breakfast i e  milk fruit bowl etcOverall this hotel worked out well for us and wed stay there again  The front desk also told me they are reating their spa gym facilities and sauna into this large spa for those coming in the future after t   
P => Best value in the city We stayed at this hotel about  years ago and werent to impressed  We ided after shopping around to stay again because their price was good and the location is amazing  The hotel has since reated and most lily gone through different managment becasue this place was soooo muich better this time  The new rooms are much nicer and well allocated and the bar and public areas are really well kept and presented  Their hotel bar is beautiful and the staff durin our whole trip was absolutly great and helpt us with a few problems which we had very well  WOULD DEFINETLY STAY AGAIN  BEST LOCATION 
P => Great Location We stayed here from   to   We picked it for its location  And it is a great location  Very central and easy to get to either Metro lines  Good Points good location good continental breakfast at good price staff was very pleasant  Very good internet connections and free Bad Points tinest room I have ever been in the washroom was so tiny that when you sat on toilet you had to sit sideways or your knees would hit tub about  inch clearance between the two  No place to put toilitries in bathroom  Bed was so hard I felt I was back in Mexico would wake up throughout night with sore side  Air Conditioner was so noisy it would wake us whenever it kicked in  Bedding    there is a duvet but this hotel uses a sheet on the bottom and a sheet on top hopefully they clean the duvet regularily  Note when we originally booked it stated on website and others that this was entirely non smooking but this is not the case  Pool and jacquzi are closed for reations until t  
P => Worst North American room ever This hotel had the worst room I have ever seen in a North American hotel dark tiny and overpriced even in Canadian dollars  Ive occasionally seen rooms this small in Europe but never before or since in Canada or the U S  You could barely move in the bathroom  The monstrous air conditioner actually touched the bed  There was about six inches of space between the TV and the foot of the bed  
P => bad jacuzi no steam room broken sauna My friend and I stayed at this hotel for a night out in Montreal and to relax  The room was clean  The managerhead desk person was kinda sleezy and recomended a horrible restaurant The Angus Steak House next door for dinner and proceeded to try and sell us on other places to eat that sounded just as bad  The quotjacuzipoolquot had about  jets and was about  by    their picture is eiving  The sauna was not working and there is NO steamroom Their security person made us uncomfortable he came up to the sixth floor where the quotjacuziquot is three times in the  min  we were in there  
P => Great Stay on a Budget My mother and I recently spent a weekend doing some shopping in Montreal and booked at the Best Western Europa because we had a gift card from Best Western We were a little worried having read some negative reviews and another Best Western in the city told us the hotel was terrible  We loved it  We had requested a non smoking room and one that had been recently reated  We checked in early our requested room was ready and very nice  Great fixtures in the little brand new bathroom and a very comfy bed The best part of our stay was their oversized indoor jacuzzi where we had a great long soak after a long day of walking around the shops  The hotel is only about a block from St Catherine Street   you really cant find a better location to access the shops  We were not looking for anything fancy just a comfortable place to sleep and it met our needs perfectly  
P => Close to almost everything My wife amp I have traveled from North east U S  amp stayed here numerous times over the last  years  I agree with most of the comments from previous reviewers however no one mentioned how close the Metro subway is to The Europa  It is only a  minute walk amp will let you off within a  minute stroll to Olde Montreal amp Port area The surrounding hotel area will cater to almost every vice amp craving with shops cigars coffee desserts  nightclubs amp yes gents even adult entertainment  Yes the parking is a bit steep amp made worse by the cranky old coot in the booth  but it is close to the hotel  The small coffee shop in the lobby will make a tastier amp stronger cup than your room coffee maker  Now if they could only fit more than  in the elevator       
P => Perfect for the budget minded and location When searching for a good place to stay centrally located and also a prime spot for the budget minded person dont look past the Best Western Europa in downtown Montreal  This was the second time I have stayed here and I will say that I wasnt disappointed  We paid under  U S  per night for the room and it was everything I expected  I didnt go in expecting the Ritz Carlton and was quite happy with everything  I have added photos of our room to this review  I unfortunately forgot to take pictures of the parking lot and the outside of the hotel  I had planned to take those shots but forgot  Before getting to my pros and cons Ill go through a couple of things  The desk people and housekeeping staff were considerate and friendly  They were also very helpful when needed and always welcomed you when coming back into the hotel  The interior is interesting and clean  I didnt check out any of the restaurants or bar in the hotel    or any other the other hotel amenities    so I cant comment on those I have pretty easy standards when it comes to hotels and traveling price cleanliness location and safety  Im not looking for all the bells and whistles some people look for when traveling  Taking all those into consideration the Best Western was a great place to be at  So first Ill go to the pros  PROS  The room was extremely clean when we first arrived  Each day the room was cleaned and shaped up  The staff was quick and courteous when dealing with this    The beds were comfortable and there were more than enough sheets and pillows on each bed we had a double room    The TV was ent sized   inch or so and worked well  We didnt use it much but it was nice to have when needed    Free wireless Internet access  Very easy to connect to and quite speedy  It was nice to be able to check my email and not have to dial up somewhere    The water in the shower was powerful enough for me  I like it when there is actually water pressure  In this situation I wasnt disappointed    The location for the hotel is perfect  Situated on Drummond you are steps from St  Catharine St  and two blocks from Crescent St  The whole area is perfect  Its also a very safe area    In regard to safety the hotel has a system set up where you have to use your key card to enter the hotel after a certain time as well as needing said card to access the elevator after a certain time  In five nights in Montreal I also never had any problems with my key cards    I cant reiterate how nice and helpful the staff was  We didnt utilize them often but with checking in checking out and the few questions we asked they were always professional and smiling  You cant ask for much more than that    Just a couple blocks from a metro station Peel which is even better MIDDLE GROUND Not a con for me but might be for others   Room size  Its small so dont let anyone kid you differently  You can see in my photos that the room is tight  But its to be expected  Ive stayed in probably   different hotels in my travels to Montreal and not many have huge rooms  Not in this price range anyway  For two people traveling and probably even three    this wouldnt be bad  We had a king room a couple years ago and had   people and it wasnt bad  But the double we were in isnt made for many more than   people  I could see where a family would have a hard time with it  But if you dont expect to spend much time there its not bad   Parking  The lot is across the street and independently owned  Its  Can per night  They jam a lot of cars in the lot  There is also a parking lot about  buildings down from the hotel  These lots are a little shabby but did the job for me  There always seemed to be someone on duty which was nice  My car was perfect when we left and nothing had happened  Seemed fine to me but I know a lot of people are worried about the lot    The air conditioner  This kind of goes as a pro and con for me  The pro part was that it worked well  The con part is when you put the shade over the window at the night it kind of covered it so by morning the AC wasnt flowing as well and it was warmer in the room    Elevators  There are two of them and they are each pretty small  Didnt bother me because we were never trying to cram in with a ton of others but I could see where if people were staying longer and had a lot more luggage it could be hard to use these  CONSThe only reason I couldnt give the hotel a  star rating was that there were a couple things I would consider cons  Now mind you I gave this place a  but it was actually like a      Bathroom size  I like a bigger bathroom  I hate having to feel cramped when Im getting out of the shower  I felt that way here  I was out of the shower and right in front of the toilet and sink  It was too crammed for my liking    Windows  There was one window in the main room and one in the bathroom although the glass they used for the one in the bathroom wouldnt allow you to look out it was more to allow light in  The window wasnt too big and it was partially taken up by the AC unit  I just like natural light so an extra or bigger window would have been nice    Electric outlets  There werent enough of them near the chairstable allowing two people to plug laptops in as well as keeping a lamp and the TV plugged in  They were too spread out and in spots where they were only good for like charging camera batteries or a cell phone  Wasnt too bad but could be a little annoying OVERVIEWThe positives of this hotel far outweighed the negatives  While we had some cons with our stay they werent enough to make us sour on the hotel  It was a pleasant stay and well worth the money  We stayed for five nights and each was fine  Checking in and checking out were both easy and painless  The room was ready when we arrived and everyone was friendly  Id stay here again and would highly recommend others to stay here  
P => POOR FACILITIES AND SHABBY ROOMS This hotel is well situated for the underground and is a safe area  I had no worries about walking around at nighttime However the rooms are shabby and in need of a complete overhaul We had  rooms on  erate floors for our various family and all  were shabby dimly lit chipped furniture stained carpets torn or loose wallpaper and paint and stained ceilings  Bathrooms were very small  even by uUK standards and electrical system was dubious Power sockets were loose on walls and coffee maker was in bathroom right at the side of the sink  The phrase electricity and water  springs to mind The corridors were uninviting and scruffy The staff were very helpful and friendly The restaurant was pricy and the cafe joined to the hotel was erratic with opening hours This has a    grading and i have seen many other hotels in Montreal with this grading much more appealing than this I would not stay here again nor recommend to others  
P => Exactly what I wanted I stayed at the BW Europa in    It is still a Best Western unlike some of the listings in Trip Advisor  I had booked on the Internet at about  dollars through the BW website which I have found gets me a better price than some  discount  websites   I would struggle to get any hotel at this price in the UK The location was ideal for me being  minutes walk from the main rail station and  minutes from Crescent and St Catherine  I had no problems on the streets up to  pm I was well pleased by the hotel  The second floor room was freshly refurbished with a nice bathroom and had an ironing board and iron  It looked onto in internal courtyard and was quiet I had one disturbance which  have been a rubbish collection but nothing else  The front and sides look onto quiet streets  Only at the rear where there is an open car park and a view onto Crescent would I think there might be some noise  The shower worked well  Breakfast was from  am to  with an attentive and helpful waiter offering a wide variety of breakfast items  The restaurant was closed on Sunday night but there are plenty of places to eat on Crescent  I would change one thing and put a bigger shelf in the bathroom if I were going to share the room  Everything was very clean and staff polite and helpful As to the comments made by others you might not like that the rooms were compact with no safe  Neither of these issues bothered me  I didn t need to park I travel by train and rent a car if I need one on the day  The room would be cosy with  guests sharing There is another Best Western on Sherbrooke nearer the University but further out of the centre  Sherbrooke is quite busy with traffic  I think I chose the right one with the Europa and I would go again  
P => Its the PITS I believe that this hotel misrepresents itself on the web  Yes parking is available   it costs   per day to have it parked in a crumbling lot outside in front of the hotel  Breakfast was supposed to come with the reservation   if breakfast counts as the self serve coffee pot in your room than I guess thats breakfast  There was no exercise room per the advertisement  The curtain in the room didnt close all the way and the hotel is downtown with bright city lights shining in  The heat didnt work and the man at the front desk resolved the situation by sending up extra blankets  The room was the size of a broom closet and the bathroom was so small I had to put my feet on the edge of the tub to sit down on the toilet  They did have hot water it just took five minutes to warm up  And the bed was so hard I wouldve been better off on the floor  And finally they made the bed in a funky way by sandwiching the comforter in between two flat sheets to hide the stained mess of a comforter they had on the bed  As for the help everyone actually seemed nice enough they just didnt have any answers  I asked how much a phone call was and after waiting for fifteen minutes the girl came back with a helpless shrug  Even during peak lobby hours they only had one girl behind the desk who was friendly enough but it took us over an hour to check out  Im a well travelled person and I dont expect a lot out of a hotel but this is by far the worst hotel Ive stayed in outside of a third world country  
P => Close to everything Great hotel Good food at the resturant great bar for relaxing and close to shopping and the Via Rail station 
P => Smallest room ever    Man I look back and think abt this place and Im like amazed  This place had the tiniest room EVER  Two people cant move around this room  We were hating ourselves for booking this room but then we thought it was funny to bump into each other  The parking is a pain too  The only good part is its downtown and you can walk around the place   Id not go there again and suggest people to get a bigger room unless of course youre single  The pictures on their website actually enticed us  The lobby was great though should admit    
P => Left after the first night I left the hotel for another one after the first night    had I just trusted the bad reviews here   The room consisted of a large TV set American style a bed and a bathroom  It was lacking daylight the window    to the extent it wasnt blocked by the gargantuous air conditioner    gave me a view of the courtyard which had its ground level above the floor of the room a chair a table and even an elementary amount of space The breakfast buffet was rather elementary and uninviting the coffee dreadful I can confirm the alarm clocks in other room comments from others and can also confirm the seemingly recent over the top ness of the lobby which contrasts heavily with the rest of the hotel There was nothing charming or quotEuropeanquot about this hotel  Dont go there  
P => I will never stay here again I am a seasoned traveller amp this is by far the WORST place I have ever stayed  The only thing going for it is the location   its right off Ste Catherine St one of the main drags in Montreal  But thats it I checked in at pm on a Wednesday amp learned that my room wasnt yet ready although check in was pm  No apology or offer of alternate accomodations  I had requested a queen bed non smoking room and had to argue for something else in the meantime  They offered me a room with  doubles instead since I absolutely had to prepare for a meeting and needed my room  I took it and when I made it upstairs the room they had given me was under reation    construction tools all over the floor the window AC unit on the ground dirt everywhere no toilet  When I went back down to the front desk there was again no apology and I was told I would need to wait at least   hours for ANYTHING to become available to me It turns out the guy serving me was the front desk manager and didnt give a hoot about the extremely inconvenient situation in which he was placing me  I was carrying  suitcases and a laptop and he claimed there was no room for him to check them somewhere for me so that I could at least go find something to eat while waiting for my room  Luckily some extremely nice travellers from BC overheard my predicament and offered to keep my bags in THEIR room Came back to the hotel at pm as told and finally my room was available  hours after the pm check in  Went upstairs the key doesnt work  Went downstairs for re coding  Back upstairs key doesnt work again  Back downstairs for re coding  Once I finally got in my room to my utter non surprise the Europa drops the ball AGAIN  They gave me the most filthy disgusting smoking room Ive ever been in   browned wallpaper film on the windows and cigarette burns on the bedspread  The smell was absolutely putrid my brief time in this room had smelled up my clothes so badly that I had to have them cleaned the next day Furious I returned to the front desk and demanded the room I reserved  Luckily there had been a shift change and the useless front desk manager had been replaced by a lovely young woman who was gracious apologetic and very understanding  She booked me into a suite with a king bed for my trouble  The room was acceptable but dated and like the rest of the hotel appeared cheap and dirty  There was a huge soaker tub in the bathroom which was its only redeeming quality  Given the overall shabby appearance of the hotel my experience and the way I was treated I will never stay here again  I wrote a  page complaint letter to Best Western head office once my trip was complete and they were at least nice enough to offer up a written apology for my negative experience FYI there is no parking available here just a paid lot across the street  As well all the windows in the rooms are sealed shut so there is no way you can get fresh air into the room to at least chase some of the musty smell away Do yourself a favour   spend an extra couple of bucks and go somewhere else  The price of this place is definitely appealing but I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for  
P => For those in need of a suite We were able to find two rooms available at this hotel on a weekend with several conferences in town  We booked them right away over the phone without really knowing anything about the hotel  When we arrived at the hotel we were offered their penthouse suite for the same  we were paying for the  erate rooms  This is a huge suite  We had  very large rooms  bathrooms  with a whirlpool tub a full eat in kitchen very large living room washer amp dryer amp the absolute best part was a large private tarrace with BBQ  This suite was very convinient as we were two families with  infants amp they were able to run around all over  Now for the negatives While we thought this was a good deal for us at the price we paid we were told the running rate is apx    per night  At   per night I would be very disapointed  The kitchen wasnt well stocked as to the basics i e  soap paper towels dish cloths etc   the dryer in one bathroom wasnt working one of the rooms did not have a t v  there was a loud noise coming from the other side of the suite that sounded like some sort of machinery that went on all night long it did not keep us or more importantly our kids from sleeping and you have to go up  flights of stairs as the elevator stops two level below the suite  I would stay here again with kids at the same price we paid  
P => European Luxury with Parking Problems This is a good location if you want to be near the business or shopping areas or if you want to watch NHL action at Bell Center  It is a bit far from Old Port however The hotel is easy to find but if you arrive by car be prepared to pay an extra  CAD per night  That will give you access to an independently owned parking lot opposite of the hotel  And in this downtown area you do not have much choice when it comes to finding a place for your car Once you are inside the hotel you will find yourself in a clean and luxurious European style environment  I stayed in a well sized room with excellent furniture including a business chair  Also you will find an in room coffee maker and a hair dryer  No fridge or microwave though  The only downside was that there was no outside view  Only a wall of the opposite building There are different rate plans available  Make sure that the breakfast is included in your rate  It really is worth every cent  It is served in the hotel restaurant and includes many hot and cold items like sausages and fruit The overall rating is definitely above average  However the hotel could get an excellent rating if the parking situation was better solved  
P => Best Western Europa Downtown We stayed in the Best Western for  nights in ust   We were extremely happy with the hotel  Our room was on the rd floor yes it was a bit small but we had enough room to manoeuve around the bottom of the bed   could have did without the table and chairs  We couldnt fault the hotel  The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable the staff again were fantastic and the cleaning lady gave me extra large towels for the whole of our stay  The breakfast each morning was extensive and tasty and replenished regularly  Like other reviewers said it is in prime location to St Catherines Street and everything is easily accessible from there  Only downside is that we dined in a restaurant on our last nite and the waiter complained that we didnt give him enough of a tip We thought   of the bill wasnt too bad  He informed us that the standard is    or more  I could not believe the cheek so beware when tipping We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel   good value for money prime location and good rooms  
P => Nice place to stay We stayed there for  nights in y   The room was small but very clean  The AC was loud and either just cold as ice or you to turn it off  Very friendly staff  The Breakfast was great  At that time the swimming world championships were in Montreal and we had the waterpolo team of Australia in our hotel  That was positive for my spouse so she had something more to look at it  The hotel is near Bell Center and St  Catherines Street  If you re looking for a nice hotel at a fair price this is the place to stay  
P => Not bad  Hello I have spend  nights in this hotel  I had booked it before I had read the reviews here so I was a bit worried that be I had booked too quickly  Ok the lobby is a bit over the top so what  The room was small but clean  So was the bathroom  I live in Europe and over here we are quite used to small rooms like that  There was a welcome coffee and tea set in the room  The airco can be put cooler or warmer you just have to find the buttons  The hotel is situated at  minutes from St Catharine street which is great  In short I didnt have any complaint here in this hotel  The staff was friendly as well  If you dont look for grand luxury this is a good hotel  Of course if you want the big thing then you better look for a  star hotel  
P => The rest of the story     I booked a room here wearily after reading all the mixed reviews then checked in and discovered the rest of the story  One TripAdvisor guest complains this hotel is a quotfire hazardquot because a set of emergency stairs leads to an alley    what heshe doesnt say is the small five story hotel is adjacent to a city firehouse making the location one of the safest around  Yes the  Leagues Under the Sea lobby is definitely different and yes many of the guest rooms are small but for  U S  a night on a summer festival weekend I couldnt find a cleaner more comfortable value and I started looking six months ago  Everyone from the check in staff to housekeeping crew was hardworking polite and professional  Im glad a few disgruntled reviewers expecting the Ritz didnt discourage me from making a reservation at this hotel  For its central location cost cleanliness and comfort Ill definitely stay at the Europa again  
P => Tiny room ok location My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night on our recent trip to Quebec  The location was fine and the staff friendly and helpful the price was ent compared to what I could find on the web from the US  However the room was really tiny I mean much worse than similar hotels Idstayed in  There was only one chair so one of us always had to sit on the bed  There was no room around the bed to open a suitcase for example on the floor or a table  We had to use the bed for that as well  The bathroom was large by comparison  This might be alright for one person with limited luggage but we were on the tail end of a two week vacation so we had two large suitcases and room didnt work for us at all  Of all the hotels we stayed in during our trip this was the only one that made us feel so claustrophobic  
P => Great Stay for the Price My husband stayed at this hotel for  nights while were in Montreal for the F races  The front desk staff were very nice and professional as were the maids and restaurant staff  The room was better than okay  It was clean and the area in which we stayed was quiet  We received free breakfast with our stay and it was okay but plentiful Overall I enjoyed this hotel  Free bottled water each day which was great as it was HOT and humid  We walked to restaurants and to the metro with no problems  We will stay again     
P => Depends on what you are looking for  It really depends on the type of traveller you are  If you like to lounge in bed for many hours in the morning watch movies   enjoy great room service etc     this is NOT the hotel for you This hotel is best suited for younger folks that will be spending very limited hours in the room  Its a great hotel just to put your head down at night and crash  The rooms are clean and humble definately small  The hotel is definately safe Probably the only reason I ever stayed at this place was when I was on a limited budget and wanted a place close to the action  There are  strip clubs less than  blocks from the hotel  A large number of really good fast food places serviing a variety of ethnic dishes and the fabled Cresent street is only  streets west of the hotel I do have to say the hotel bar is overpriced and housekeeping takes forever if your room is higher than the rd floor To summerize you stay here for location and price  Not for luxury  
P => A bit hard Felt compelled to give my opinion following the string of bad reviews  my wife and i felt the hotel offered reasonable rooms in an excellent location for barsshopping etc  Rooms were clean though a little basic and maintained every day tried the asian restaurant but didnt like it be down to my taste as others loved it  Found reception staff efficient and courteous and found the locality safe for such a lively area  
P => Location overrides everything else This is the BEST location to stay if youre into shopping nightlife people watching at a cafe walking around to the sights or anything else Montreal  St  Catherine is  feet from the front door The cafes and clubs on Cresent are just two blocks away  The hotel was easy to get to driving into Montreal and parked across the street although a little pricey but all parking is  Ok the room was a little crampy and the bathroom door bumped into the towel rack so it didnt open all the way  But spending more time outside of the room than in it didnt bother me  I was able to sneak a peak into other rooms with  queen beds and they were a lot larger  It  just depend on which room or suite you get stuck with  We had a room at the end of the corridor whichh probably helped with the layout of it  The hotel could use a face lift but everything I saw was clean and the staff was friendly even when a group of  were looking for a sight seeing tour at the height of check ins  Overall I would stay here again to be in the middle of it all without shelling out a lot of money need to save that for the shopping  
P => Looks good from the outside looks can be eiving Previously stayed at the nearby otel one block west and recommended and ided to try this hotel looked nice from the outside  Good location but small rooms with very small bathrooms about the worst view Ive ever come across stained carpet in the corridors and not particularly helpful staff when we arrived early  On site restaurants were never tried there are far better in the neighbourhood  try Chez Cora for breakfast  a couple of blocks east  Not a comfortable spot from which to enjoy exploring Montreal our favourite city  Hotel was one of the reasons we cut our stay in Montreal short  Not recommended  
P => Its not as bad as everyone seems to think Honestly its not as bad as everyone seems to think  Ive stayed here twice in the summer of  and  had a great stay both times and will continue to stay here in the future  Yes the room is small and the lobby is alittle on the modern medivaltacky side but who comes to Montreal to hang out in their hotel room Its reasonably priced has an amazing location near Crescent St  Ste  Catherine St  and the Metro and incredible restaurants are always easy to find The staff is also very friendly and helpful  You might get the odd person who speaks french and not much english but you have to remember     youre in Montreal what do you expect 
P => Do not stay I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all  The only good thing I have to say is that the location is great  My husband and I ided to stay here on their web deal of stay  nights and get the rd free  What it didnt say is that youd have to fight with reception to get this deal  The lobby is VERY tacky looking  The room we stayed in was appaulingly small  The bathroom is so small that you literally had to hang your feet into the bathtub to use the washroom  They also have no parking and no parking recommendations for you  For  nights we ended up having to pay  for parking  The hotel restaurant is Japanese only so if your not into that then your screwed Overall I found the whole experience terrible the staff not friendly at all and even though everything appeared clean it felt very dirty  
P => Not impressed Stayed here in ust    found the lobby unusual verging on tacky The rooms are very small and grubby and the bathrooms are tiny  Its in a good location but would not stay at this hotel again  
P => Small with Big Attitude  
P => Excellent location  
P => Fair hotel  
P => Never Again  
P => Bug alert  
P => would never stay again  
P => Yikes  
P => Un bon H tel en Centre ville

P => beautiful stay My husband and I stayed one night  The room was clean and beautful  I loved the white linen bed The bed was very comfortable  As for the bathroom it was very clean and had everything we needed  Everyone was kind polite and helpful  I will go back when I want to stay in Montreal  
P => Stay away from this hotel First off there is no parking at the hotel  You need to have a valet get your car every time you need it  and of course they charge you for that  Beds are comfortable but the TV doesnt work and the furniture is old and repit  Large yellow stains on the ceiling from who knows what  Very noisy as well from the street  We booked for three nights and checked out after two and they still charged me for the third night even thoough I let them know long before the check in time for the third night  which I thought was extremely unfair  I go to Montreal on a regular basis and it is the first time I stayed there and it will be the last  I will go back to the Lord Berri  
P => Not worth the price This hotel is in a great location but it was almost  per night for a standard room and they charge you  per night for parking  There are only  elevators and they wont let you use the stairs  We got in after the big UFC fight and it took us  mins to get an elevator   the line was crazy  
P => Nice hotel in great location  I stayed at this hotel around   Amazing location and nice rooms but a bit on the small side  Windows open ServiceGood service RoomsNice clean rooms with modern or  Location Great location five minute walk from the Bell Centre two minute walk to restaurant and bar district two blocks St  Catherine Street shopping across the street from Le Cours Mont Royal shopping mall Metro and the underground City  
P => No nonsense hotel in the perfect location I chose this hotel because of location right next to McGill University where I was visiting and price  At Cdn per night it was significantly cheaper than even the McGill corporate rates at other hotels near by  This hotel is a ent clean hotel with modest amenities  Rooms are smallish and darkish but the beds are comfortable and the toilet works  Be aware that there is only valet parking at  per night  Only complaint was no real available electrical plugs    had to unplug lamps to work the computer  Also the free WiFi download is limited to MB per day    enough for updating email but if you have teenagers with YouTube addictions forget it Its location is great for visiting McGill or walking to the main drags of St  Catherines street or Crescent Street for shopping or bars  The old city or St  Laurent is a bit of a hike but there is a great Metro system This would be one of my first choices when looking for a room in Montreal  
P => A great place to stay We stayed in the Best Western Ville ie Hotel for six days  We had information about the Hotel from the AAA travel book  The Hotel is in an excellent location in the downtown area  It is within walking distance to numerous restaurants and entertainment areas  It is also within a block of a Metro station  Check  in and check out went very smoothly because of a very courteousfriendly and efficient staff  During the course of our stay we encountered a problem with the cleaning staff  The problem was dealt with quickly to our satisfaction  The concierge staff was extremely helpful even though they were very busy at peak times The room was spacious and the bathroom had above average amenities  The bed was very comfortable and had white duvet covers  While at the Hotel we needed access to a computer  We were allowed to use a computer with internet connections which was located in a private business centre room  We were most impressed with the Hotel and recommend it to anyone 
P => Disturbing I am not sure how this quotHotelquot got its rating of  stars although it says  stars on a plague in the lobby  I would say its more like a  star motel  The service was very good and they are really doing their best with what theyve been given but my God its time for an update to the rooms My room was tiny dank outdated and had a dirty feeling I kept my shoes or socks on the whole time  There was no remote control for the T V  the mini bar had been removed and I read somewhere else that you had to pay to have them bring it back you have to get up to turn the lights off the wall paper is ancient and the carpet is old and faded  Now to the disturbing part they dont have fitted sheets on the bed resulting in me waking up in the morning with my face directly on the mattress I would imagine purchasing some fitted sheets would be a rather inexpensive somewhat hygienic investment and I actually read about this before going but hoped that it wasnt true  I wrote a note to housekeeping to please tuck the sheets in the following night and they managed to tuck  of them in a small achievement The next night just as I was putting my head down on the pillow I noticed a blood stain that was not mine truly gross The hotel is in a great location and Montreal is fantastic but for the price you can do much much better  
P => Eh   could do better In a word i would give this hotel an quotEhquot   the location is unbeatable however  Located just north of Rue St  Catherine this hotel is far enough away to not have millions of people around all the time but close enough to everything to feel like youre in the thick of it  Close to a metro dining shops and museums this location couldnt be better  Unfortunately however the conditions were sub par  The Room was fairly clean but the bedding situation was unusual  There were no sheets on the bed they expect you to use the spread dirty to sleep on  There was only one pillow on the bed and after searching found the other in a bag in the closet  The shower was the best part of the room and offered great pressure and temp control  I read other reviews of this hotel before booking and people were complaining of the air conditioning situation   or lack thereof which is entirely true  The room on a hot summer day was muggy and not comfy to sleep in and the air conditioning didnt work at all  All in all if you dont expect much from a one night stay or a similar circumstance then this is a fine place to stay otherwise i would search for other options  
P => Best Western   Best Concierge I just got back from a stay at the Best Western in Montreal for the Jazz Festival  The hotel was very nice great comfortable beds large rooms  The location of the hotel is also great right downtown near some great shopping  However the best part of the stay was the AMAZING service provided by our concierge   Rami  I have been to Montreal often and have stayed at a lot of different hotels but this is the first one where the concierge has gone out of his way to make sure our visit to Montreal was truly enjoyable  
P => Good location Stayed for  days  Location of Hotel is good easy to get to other parts of the city Room was OK but in need of oration  Staff helpful  
P => Excellent Location My parents booked this hotel on my behalf for a  night stay in Montreal  My stay started off on a slightly shaky note though as I arrived alone at midnight due to severe train delays on Amtrak only to be told that I did not have a reservation  I insisted that I did and only after some shuffling around and my assuring them Id told them I was still coming did they find my room details  PhewHowever after that minor hiccup I was pleased to find that my room was great   good size extremely comfortable bed ent closet space nice large bathroom and lovely view of the Mont Royal  The room was cleaned spotlessly each day and the cleaning staff were pleasant and cheerful  The hotel  look ugly from the outside but its really quite pleasant inside The hotel lobbyreception isnt impressive and at times is too small for the volume of people arriving at once  However the staff   especially the concierges   were very helpful and the people running the nice coffee show were really nice actually everyone in Montreal was friendly and really welcoming but what made it so easy was the location of the hotel  Perfectly located for great restaurants shops and McGill University  One day we were so tired we literally just crossed the road and had a superb meal  Similarly as a treat we had planned a breakfast at the Ritz and were delighted to discover it was just  minutes walk away Its also a very safe feeling neighbourhood and even the station isnt far to walk to at night All in all a well priced and well located hotel   dont go thinking it will be a really glamourous experience but its the perfect choice if you want a comfortable clean and convenient hotel  
P => Great Location Great Service I stayed at the Best Western Ville ie for three nights in the middle of il  The staff was incredibly helpful through my entire stay  My room was incredibly large and always kept clean The free internet room downstairs was great Traveling alone and without a laptop I was able to keep connected with my friends and family back home  Although there were only two computers there was never a wait and I often had the entire room to myself  The location was excellent   very close to the Metro and right next door to McGill University  Plus all of downtown is within walking distance The only problem I had was that my room key card kept deprogramming but within minutes each time I had a had a new card with many apologies from the desk clerks although it wasnt their faultWhen I checked out they called a cab for me and wished me on my way  I will definitely be staying here if I find myself in Montreal again  
P => Great Value for Money We have stayed at the Best Western Montreal several times during our  month stay in Canada  The Staff are very friendly and helpful rooms are large beds are comfortable and rooms are clean and tidy  It is a very comfortable well located value for money hotel in downtown Montreal  If you are looking for  star luxury then this is not for you  If you are looking for value for money this is EXCELLENT  
P => Freindly atmoshphere Our family stays at the hotel every summer and find the staff excellent and you get the feeling of a homey atmoshphere  I would tell anyone to stay here its so close to everything  The rooms are comfortable pillows can be better  Overall a great hotel for the price  
P => Beware of the TV system The TV system in this hotel is confusing to say the least  You can be put in the position to pay for a movie you didnt watch if you are not VERY careful  The hotel employs an outside company to run its TV system and they dont help customers in trying to get money refunded for services not received  
P => It was okay but not great Considering the price that we paid for a double room it shouldve been a nicer double room  I felt ripped off  The room was semi clean   the sheets were not pulled tightly and the pillows were flat The ventilation fan in the bathroom was loud and there were cracks on the wall  The water in the bathtub did not drained properly it took a while to drained  Some of the great things were ironing board and wireless access in the room and there is a gym on the third floor  There is a Lebanese restaurant on the ground floor and a cafe  Sure the location was great but there are plenty of hotels around the area  
P => Hidden Costs but Super Service I called many hotels to get Rates and Discounts and none stood out like the Guy on the phone here  I had already read about Rami and Peter bending over backwards to help out people in a prior review  Well that name stuck in my head and when I heared that same person on the phone with the caring and will to help and a genuine  we want you to stay with us   It was something really surprising for North American standards  Well Rami convinced me to book at this hotel for location and service and gave me a great rate with the AAA membership  When I called back at pm when we got to Montreal it was their colleague ie who said that she could put aside a great room for usas we were already going to be charged anyway and she didn t let us down even though we only checked in at pm that great room on the th floor with a view on of the mountain was on hold for us  Now let me tell you about check in  It was Peter saying quotanything you want sir we are at your servicequot  He looked at me and suggested clubs and VIP line bypass and gave us a rundown of the events in Montreal that weekend  From the Firework competition to the Comedy Festival and even restaurants and getting around the city on their METRO  I am  and I come in from Toronto with my Mom to visit my sister and some friends I had met in Cuba over the last year  So it was different things that we wanted to do but they were upto the task and we had a great time Now this was the only bigger hotel that acted like the small Bed ampBreakfasts where the owners tell you where to go and what to do  In the larger Hoity Toity joints I would have probably got a great cooperate rate but I have never liked dealing with the snotty Concierges who make you feel like they are opening the gates of heaven to me by giving you confidential info The only drawbacks were just the added cost of night if you wanted a mini fridge brought to the room and centscentstax so that was ONE DOLLAR PER LOCAL CALL  This is ok if you make just a couple of calls but my sister and many friends are Montreal s soo that added up like a drink bill on a cruise ship  Then the only other thing was that if you wanted a room with  double beds it was  bucks more even if you didn t have any more than  people staying in the room  So now you are probably saying this is nothing just a bit more but   it can add up very quickly and mean about  more at checkout  This is something that I wouldn t see at any other star hotel but this is what makes me think of this place as a Best Western  Only annoying thing   Getting ICE   floors   but ice machines only on  floors  That means if you want a COLD drink at any given time you more than likely will have to take an elevator to get some ice  But I will still be back at this hotel whySTAFF LOCATION and SERVICEI will just bring up a cooler and tell everyone to call me or bring my voice over IP with laptop  
P => Wonderful On a recent trip to Canada my husband and I took a train to Montreal  What a wonderful city We stayed at the Best Western Ville ie right in downtown and were very pleased with our choice  The price was reasonable and the hotel will provide you with free internet access if you have a laptop The technical support was superb in helping me establish a connection  The hotel is right in the middle of everything and everything else is within walking distance  We had a fabulous time in Montreal and would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great staff clean classy friendly Fantastic location  literally seconds away from Rue Ste  Catherine and the nearest Metro stop Concierge front desk were amazing  very accommodating willing to put my luggage in storage for over a day no cost very knowledgeable about tourist spots how to get there best eats etc  etc Much classier than your typical best western  My room was   clean and very spacious and had a great view of the downtown district  
P => Had a great time I stayed at this hotel and found very nice  The price was reasonable and the service was great  The front desk and conceirge staff were extremly helpfull  I would definetly recomend this hotel to anyone  
P => Best Deal in Montreal   Wonderful Staff    Great Location OVERALLWe stayed here in ust  about the same time as the previous reviewers  We booked somewhat in advance and did not have any issues getting a non smoking room Our room was clean and there were no maintenance problems The lobby of this hotel is very nice although it was a little more spread out  strangely configured than most hotel lobbies  The lobby had a very nice chandelier and fountain  There is a valet  concierge when you enter  It is definitely much nicer than your typical Best Western                                 WHAT WE LIKEDThe staff The two staff Peter and Rami were outstanding They bent over backwards to discuss sightseeing ideas restaurants directions and to make reservations for us  They were INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful  I received the type of service from them that I would expect at a five star hotel like the Ritz Carlton The location was great It is located a couple of blocks from the Metro it was very close to the top restaurants in the city and to the beginning of the shopping area  Since it was centrally located a lot of the places we went were walkable to us e g  the old city although some people who dont like walking  think otherwise There was a very nice Lebanese restaurant adjoining the hotel as well as a caf   The restaurant seemed a lot nicer than restaurants in other hotels of this price range For what you received you couldnt beat the price in Montreal  Just book far enough in advance with the understanding that depending on whowhere you book it from the price will vary dramatically    you have to bargain hunt for discounts  We paid less than   night                        WHAT WE DIDNT LIKEDuring our stay we happened to be across the street from the Omni hotel staff strike  Our roomwindow was facing the Omni Hotel  With that in mind they were playing loud music and screaming through megaphones  Although they didnt picket late at night or real early in the morning it was early enough to be our wake up call NOTE This is not the hotels fault and there is nothing they could do about this  
P => Dont go to this hotel This hotel is very good located the rooms are ok the bathroom is ok  However the price per room is very expensive I paid   for  nights My problems with this hotel started when I went into my room  I asked for a non smoking room and I found my room terrible smoked  It smelt disgusting  I asked for another room but they couldnt change my room because the hotel was completed that weekend  My first night was terrible  I ask the second night for new sheets and blanket etc  They told me ok but they didnt replaces them  On the top of all the street is very noiseI dont spend too much time in the hotel The only thing I want is a clean room a good bed and silent  And I didnt get it from this hotel and I spend lots of money in it  
P => Very nice  
P => If you are looking for Peace and Relaxation  STAY AWAY from it  
P => Excellent  
P => what a great Discovery

P => great location What I likedLocation was great   walking distance from St Catherines and Old Montreal  Its on a street lined with hotels and its very quiet  I also got a corporate rate so it was really worth it for me  dont think its worth  per night which is the standard rate What i didnt likeI had made  erate bookings online  the night manager couldnt find one of the bookings  instead of creating a new one he said there was an issue with my booking and it  have not been completed which isnt true since i had confirmation and the other  bookings were fine and just nagged about it  What made it worse was it was  am and we had a  year old with us   he could have just created a new one  the other issue is that since each room has a kitchen we found that if your neighbours were cooking you would smell it throughout your room  unfortunately for us our neighbours were always frying fish and smokingI really liked the location so if you could find a hotel in the vicinity for cheaper go for it  
P => Great stay at this apartment style hotel free internet in the business center laundry machines are free Had a free night  Impressed with apartment style suite with full kitchen although no dining table  Laundry machines are FREE Ask for room facing the courtyard  very quiet  Great location just blocks to Old Montreal and downtown without the high prices  Mostly a business crowd when I was there  Room furnishings a tad dated  Free internet in the business center  Great stay no complaints  
P => Good location for a visit to Montreal We stayed only one night and found the apartment style two bedroom suite very adequate for us and our twenty something dhter and her boyfriend  Location was close to Vieux Montr al and the downtown area  Beds were very comfortable  Price was reasonable  
P => Whoa what a fire alarm system and what a bunch of BS from the staff We stayed there for  nights and the first night after a long drive from Toronto we were evacuated for a fire alarm malfunction Several hours later at  in the morning again the alarm starts going  Again evacuated and scared and again several different stories as to why this is happening  At first it was acting up and malfunctioning and they were sorry  The next day after asking for  day comp we were told it was a customer hanging something that made the alarm go off  A different story with each employee  Needless to say  not happy customers  
P => Not too bad because of the location Hithis hotel is a bunisess service appartment type  You get a studio appartment with a small kitchen with microwave oven and a fridge  You will get free access into the ground floor laundery room  You will be able to have your onw postsl box  The main strenght is the hotel is few yards from Saint Catherine China town and the latin quarter  So for us having a baby it was ideal to get by and of course the kitchen was a must  No breakfast service available Abid 
P => Highly recommend this hotel Excellent location walking distance to Chinatown Old Montreal St  Catherine St  shopping IGA grocery store Montreal Jazz FestRoom We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite as a platinum priority club member  Very spacious with a arate living room and full kitchen  Room  has a great view of Old Montreal and the river  Bedroom comfortable bed  However linens not as nice and comfy as a Holiday Inn Express  Bedspread was extremely heavy Great for winter months but too hot and heavy in the summer  Airflow from air conditioner was hitting our heads so we ended up either sleeping with our heads on the bottom of the bed or we turned off ac and opened windows  Bad thing with opened windows is the noise from the street although this wasnt really an issue with us as we were at the festival till midnight and were usually dead tired when we got to the hotel so we just slept thru the noise  Living room furnished with a sofa bed a recliner and a desk  Kitchen furnished with a full size  burner electric stove with an oven a full size refrigerator dishwasher microwave toaster good quality pots and pan one medium and one small pots and a medium fryingsaute pan  Also provided are plates bowls glasses and eating utensils for two and basic cooking utensils  Nice layout with eat in counter arating kitchen and living room  Amenities Loved the free use of laundry facilities  The room even comes with a laundry basket Exercise room equipped with basic equipment and was sufficient Free DVD movies available at front desk  Safe deposit box available at front desk Excellent free internet connection Room serviced only once a week but can exchange dirty towels for clean ones at front desk anytime  Excellent front desk service  Very friendly and accommodating staff  Unlike other Candlewood Suites this hotels front desk was staffed  hours Valet parking is provided by the Holiday Inn Express next door  Overall I love the quotapartmentquot feel at this hotel and being able to cook our own food This hotel is definitely my first choice when I am in Montreal for the Jazz fest  
P => No room service but great location This aparthotel from the Interconti hotel group without a restaurant is in the same building as the Holiday Inn Express valet service provided by the Holiday Inn Express  Our quiet twin bed room on the th floor faced the inner court and was spacious with full size kitchenette and large bathroom  As there s only room service once a week you ll get fresh towels at the front desk  Here you ll a helpful team and safe deposit box  It was ok for   nights  There s a small gym and a self laundromat at no charge  Location location location only  walking mins  from the city hall and Old town  Lots of shops incl  Underground city and the metro station are just minutes away by foot  Next time I d use a full service hotel or even the next door Holiday Inn Express even though our stay was fine  
P => Great value for money This apartment style accommodation was very convenient and in a great location only  mins walk from the metro and the superket ten minutes to the new port area with lots of restaurants bars shops etc  We had a  bedroom suite which was more than adequate for just  people we were upgraded good size kitchen large bathroom  double bedrooms and a spacious living room with TV bedcouch and two leather reclining chairs and free wifi internet  the staff were very friendly and helpful  There is a laundry free for guests use and also a small shop  They have a large lounge which we used after check out as we had a late flight  If you need to take the bus to the airport be aware that you take a smaller mini bus to the bus station where you then have to wait in a long line to get your tickets make sure you leave plenty of time as the buses leave every half hour on time and it took about  hour in the traffic to get to the airport  All in all a great stay in Montreal and we would return to Candlewood Suites  
P => Great room  We are middle class  somethings who stayed here for a   weeks with two children under  and our dog  The room was comfortable and clean  The tub was extremely slippery even with a safety mat  My husband actually fell out of the tubshower not fun  You must restock everything on your own as rooms are supposedly cleaned only once per week  Ours was never cleaned until they came by while we were packing to leave   weeks mind you  There is no wireless and the hotwire connection is super slow but it does work  Our refrigerator didnt work so well and one of the burners on our stove was unplugged and very difficult to reattach  When we asked for replacement sheets and extra dishes room comes with service for  only it took   days and three requests to get them  The poor guy who brought them up was probably expecting a tip but after rewashing our two cups so we could take turns eating and drinking i wasnt in the right mood for generous tips  Sorry Mr  All in all its a good place for families with or without pets  Its not the Omni so you wont feel terrible if your children get a little loud  Also parking is day cheaper in the lot behind the hotel but you have to pay each day by am or you could get a ticket  
P => Comfortable   Great Location   Practical   Friendly   Good Value for the Money We stayed a week at Candlewood Suites in   We were very satisfied with our stay and would highly recommend it   We stayed in a Bedroom Suite so had a small kitchen arate living room with a hideabedcouch and bedroom  Very spacious  Had a great view of the St Lawrence River  They provide a full size refrigerator oven and stove so you can save some dollars by eating in  Fantastic location    My husband and I walked everywhere Old Montreal Downtown and you are a few blocks away from three metro stations  There is a grocery store and several restaurants in different price ranges to choose from  I love the fact that they provide laundry facilities free of charge  Although we did not have cleaning services not provided on a weeks stay we could exchange our towels anytime for fresh ones  They offer Valet parking which was quick and easy and reasonably priced  Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff  The hotel runs a small grocery in the lobby where hotel guests can purchase ice cream sodas frozen entrees etc   a nice convenience The minor negatives   The hideabedcouch was rather spartan   a bit too hard on the arms and such  not as comfortable as it looked  We had one guest stay for a night and she said it was OK to sleep in it for one night  So if you are more then two and for several days you  want to consider getting a suite with two beds which are quite comfortable  bedroom window had to be closed or completely open   nothing in between  no radioI consider this to be minor and would definitely return Cheers and Happy travelling 
P => Apartment style hotel This is a great place to stay if you like to make your own breakfast and want some space to stretch out  We had a one bedroom suite  Because it is an extended stay hotel there is no daily room service it is only weekly  If you want fresh towels you have to exchange them at the front desk  An IGA store is a few blocks away at the shopping mall but there is also a small room at the hotel that has a small assortment of goods from toiletries to snacks for sale  It is connected with the Holiday Inn Express and that is here you have to park day  You park on the side street take your keys inside and the valet parks the car for you in the underground  It is not a fancy hotel but the kitchen has all you need to cook meals and the bed is VERY comfortable  
P => Totally Adequate   You Get What You Pay For  Nothing fancy basic accomodation  ent beds  Having the kitchen as per all Candlewood Suites is useful and there is a proper superket IGA a couple blocks away  The or is dreary but the rooms are well sized  Lots of florescent bulbs which seems to becoming the Eco conscious norm   but make everything look ugly  The fitness center is barebones however for the gym minded there is a ent YMCA at the Dejardins complex two blocks west    minute walk to Vieux Port gt minute walk to the UQAM metro stop which accesses two lines  gt minute walk to Gay Village  Parking situation is a little strange   Valet only which needs to be accessed via the Holiday Inn Express in the same complex next door  Business Center with desktops and printers is useful if you dont travel with a laptop and there is free hi speed in the rooms  
P => Location We  of my girlfriends and I chose Candlewood Suites based mostly on what folks said here on TripAdvisor  Everyone that spoke of the great location is absolutely right  We were very pleased to discover that Montreal is as much of a walking city as our own city of Boston  Its an easy walk to Chinatown the Latin Quarter and Old Montreal Our one bedroom suite was terrific  It was clean bright comfortable and very spacious  While its necessary to try new and different restaurants when traveling one or two meals quotinquot can really help out the budget  The well equipped kitchen allowed us to do that  And there is a large superket a few blocks away  The staff rocks Chad at the front desk had all of the answers to our many questions  He gave us the scoop on the many festivals that were going on while we were there  And he even lhed at my stupid jokes   This hotel definitely exceeded our expectations  
P => Good hotel   Great Value We stayed at The Candlewood Suites for  nights in ember  around Grey Cup The location was really good   two block walk to a subway line  minute walk to Old Montreal  minute walk to downtown on a safe busy street Lots of restaurants within about a  minute walk Our room was a small apartment with a small fully equipped kitchen  So compared to a regular hotel room it was huge  You only get maid service once a week but that was fine with us  The room was clean  The bedding was excellent and the bed very comfortable  The bathroom towels were a little old and scratchy It s about  blocks to Place Desjardins which is part of the Montreal Underground City  From there you can get downtown without having to go outside for more than half a block though it s further than walking outside  So on colder days this is helpful if you still want to walk The front desk staff was excellent  Checkin was quick and they were always friendly and helpful Our only complaint was that there is no wireless internet access in the rooms  And the wired internet was very slow at times But al in all a great stay at a great price  
P => Great room great location great price Family of four parents sons  and  stayed here during the Thanksgiving weekend  Nothing but kudos we would absolutely come here again We have stayed in the past at Le Square Phillips which is a little bit nicer but also at least   more expensive Room with  Queens and a pull out sofa was perfect size price was outstanding  Valet parking reasonable about  a night  Staff very nice Everything quite clean  Excellent kitchenette fully supplied with pots pans etc  We saved more money by eating in for breakfast and an occasional snack  Theres a convenience store just   blocks away to the East very nice owners and a well stocked IGA superket  blocks to the West Candlewood is only  blocks to Chinatown great for cheap Asian food and gifts and  blocks to Latin Quarter unlimited number of restaurants to choose from mostly in moderate price range  Just a  cab ride to center of town or Vieux Montreal  
P => Good Hotel Downtown This hotel is a good location right in downtown  We were able to easily walk to St  Denis Str  and then over to China Town then down to the Old section of town on the River  Later we went back to the hotel and then out to dinner over on Cresent Street  The hotel is connected to a Holiday Express with the unique arrangement of having to get valet from there  The room was large with full kitchen that we didnt use  The property looks older with some recent updates  We were very happy with this hotel for use and would use it again when in the area next time  
P => Very Good Experience  Really enjoyed our stay at the Candlewood Suites in Montreal Centre Ville  Location was perfect and the room was very clean and comfortable  Staff was very nice and helpful  
P => Great Accomodations There was a minor snafu with our reservation at the time of check in but the manager was very accomodating and updated us to a larger suite than expected  The rooms were very modern  clean and very spacious  The free breakfast was actually much better than what you usually get at similar places This is a well run hotel The location is OK but you are a very short walk to all the downtown areas  
P => Great family hotel We stayed here for five nights the room was large and clean and all the facilities provided kitchen appliances free internet connection etc  were working as expected The location is a short walk away from the city centre and right next to the chinatown  Since this is a suite type hotel it could be mentioned that there is a great large grocery store just two blocks away The hotel staff wasnt the most competent the handling of our problems our reservation was set to start on a wrong day and during our stay someone else had been using our parking slot which they first tried to charge on us could have been more efficient  On the other hand both problems were solved with a few phone calls  
P => Great Hotel good location helpful staff Good location and helpful staff  our room was not ready and we were given a better room on the  floor  Clean spacious room with LCD TV in each room  DVD Player and free movies at the front counter  Kitchenette with everything you need and IGA grocery store one block west on Rene Levesque  
P => Fantastic stay Candlewood suites is not like your typical hotel it is designed for long term business visiters and therefore the accommodation is more like an appartment with a open plan kitchen and living room  housekeeping is only done once a week which was fine with us theres no need to change linen and towels everyday anyway My sister and I were happily surprised to see the facilities that each suite offers  The rooms are pretty clean amp comfortable fridge freezer two large tvs dvd in living room towels crockery and cutlery microwave but not electric kettle large desk free highspeed internet in the room if you bring your laptop  You can also use the free business facilities if you dont bring your own computer  Free laundry facilities although you have to bring your own washing powder Location was the absolute best  I cant emphasise enough that every single one of the front desk staff was extremely friendly helpful and made you feel really welcome  They also have a small selection of dvds that you can borrow The only slightly negative was the fact that the air con didnt work in the living room only in the bedroom  Otherwise it was a lovely stay  
P => Not perfect but definitely doable    Stayed at the hotel from   to    for the Montreal jazz festival  We used comp points from Holiday Inns Priority Club program  Candlewood costs  points a night compared to the adjacent Holiday Inn Express which cost   Here are the positives of the hotel Location  minute walks to the old city Chinatown Jazz Festival Latin Quarter The Village and the Metro  Absolutely perfect location even though the area a block away is a little seedy it was still pretty safe  My wife and I walked back from the jazz fest at  Am on more than one night so dont worry about the area  And yes you can find a hotel in a nicer section but probably not as centrally located  I cant stress this enough this is a great locale   Front desk staff were very nice and accomodating  The room condition We had a newly reated very large  bedroom suite on the th floor room   The room was in excellent physical condition with  flat screen TVsDVD player view of the beautiful City Hall in the view port section of the city full kitchen  No mold or old and dilapidated furniture The negatives The air conditioning unit is only in the bedroom  It is also a very loud machine  It cools off the suite if you turn it up high and leave the bedroom door open but the bedroom will feel like Antartica  No housekeeping which is a facet of Candelwoods service  You will need to run down to the lobby for extra towels soap or tissues etc  And you have to make your own bed or not   No ice machine on the Candlewood side of the hotel  You will have to run over to the Holiday Inn Express which is a erate entrance in the same building   No Breakfast bar but you could probably sneak into the Express and no one would know or care or you could cook your own  Overall I would not hesitate to go back but dont expect the Four Seasons or the Bellagio  
P => great solution We recently vacationed in Montreal with our  year old son  We did not want to book  hotels rooms so when we found Candlewood Suites we went ahead and made a reservation  It was the perfect solution for us  My wife and I had a comfortable queen bedroom with  night stands dresser closet window AC and a LCD TV  Our son in the lounge area had a nice sleeper sofa another larger LCD TV and DVD player  There were   leather like full recliner chairs and end table  A lanai and window faced the old town and port  The bathroom had a full size showertub  There was also a fully furnished kitchen with refrigerator microwave cooktop coffee maker dishes pot and pans  An eating counter and bar stools too On the ground floor RC rez des chaussee is reception business center free internet and printing laundry and exercise room  The place was very clean and conveniently located  The Holiday Inn Express their sister property is next door   minute walk to the old town it borders Chinatown  minutes to downtown and  to the train station  Nice IGA superket  blocks one direction small grocery store  blocks another  Neighborhood surrounding is not great but it was OK we felt safe at all times  Don t book it if you want a luxury hotel experience with nice amenities full service bell hops etc  There is not daily maid service Book it if you want a clean conveniently located hotel with lots of room  A real value here  
P => new years amazing hotel Ive stayed at this hotel  times  n its always been a good stay   very clean   very roomy   extremely friendly staff that are always willing to help   we had  people in the room for new years when maximum was    and never got noise complaints   its full of teens and party people so if you want a fun place stay here  First time I stayed we were loud but we just got a warning from a really nice security guard   Next time I go to Montreal im staying here again   
P => Good Choice I spent  nights in Candlewood  Comfortables beds nice kitchen the bedroom have a lot of space and the bathroom was bigger than I expected  The location is nice too but this hotel isn t in the best part of Sta  Catharina Av but you can easily go there by foot or by subway this hotel is near Notre Dame cathedral and the old Montreal around  min by foot or you can take the subway too This hotel doesnt have breakfast and daily maid but its not a problem to us because have a kitchen and you can change your towels every day  If you want a good bedroom and nice location for a reasonble price this place is perfect to you  
P => Cant Beat the Candlewood Montreal We were staying a few days in Montreal on the way from Albany to Boston OK its not a direct connection but it sounded good to us  A friend recommended the Holiday Inn Express but when I called to make the reservation I told the agent we wanted a full kitchen stove etc  and he said that the Candlewood Suites shared the same building as the Holiday Inn and had a full kitchen so we made the reservation  Used our AAA discount  Good rate When we arrive we were pleased to find that its in the center of town  Its a newish building and the two hotels really are side by side and share some facilities  The valet parked our car I understand theres a charge for parking and we went in  The front desk staff were very helpful  We went up to our room and while the corridors were a little dark and dingy the actual room was big and light  Queen bed full kitchen big living room nice view The front desk staff remember our name theyre helpful and friendly  Free DVDs theres a player in the room a workout room a largish laundry advice on where to go locally weve yet to have a question where the answers no Location is great IGA close by stores the old city and the port Wed definitely stay here again 
P => Great location This hotel is in a great location   a few minutes walk to Vieux Montreal Quartier Latin St Catherine St and on the doorstep of Chinatown We had a  bedroom suite which had a arate living room  We took advantage of the kitchen and ate in a few nights which saved money as did the free laundry This hotel had every amenity we needed although a pool would have been nice is reasonably priced and good views from the balcony Highly recommendedPS make sure you have the smoked meat sandwich at Schwartzs     
P => Awsome hotel in montreal First of all i am so surprised to geta star hotel for less than   The location was awsome friendly staffs  First the receptionist gave me a room with  bed  Then i told him i booked for  adults and immediately he gave me a suite  Its a br with flat tv  living room with couch flat tv recliner and high spped internet amp a kitchen with microwave oven all utensils including plates fork spoon cups and everything  This is awsome    I loved the place and booked again in hotwire and got the same room for the second day  The third day also i tried and i did not get this hotel and i got VIP SUITE  That was one of the worst hotel i stayed in my whole trip  Anyway candlewood is an awsome place and i will give   for this hotel instead of    Its such an awsome place  Nureya 
P => Magnifique What a great surprise  I paid under  in Downtown MOntreal for a  bedroom suite It was SUPER clean and had TWO flatscreen tvs  The kitchen was well equipped and teh staff went out of their way to be helpful  I would deifinately stay here a again  What a great find  
P => extremely clean rooms I was very impressed first with the staff at reception who were more than courteous and took time to talk with us  We had a lovely suite with a nice view  the suite was spotless and reated  I had chosen this hotel as I had a lot of cooking to do for students at a nearby University for a special dinner  It was a pleasure to cook in the kitchen  The washroom was as well extremely clean and with more than enough towels I would highly recommend this hotel as I usually am not so impressed whenever I stay anywhere that is situated in a downtown core in a large city  
P => Good price and okay location My husband and I booked this hotel on Hotwire  It states that it is  stars and there are some great things about it  The location is ok you can walk to most things but there are some quotdiceyquot areas so watch which direction you walk at night A few blocks to an IGA Chinatown and one block to St  Catherine St  the main street with all the malls although you are on the far end and its about a  minute walk to the Eaton Centre  Its right beside the Days Inn and the Holiday Inn Express so if its the location you are after you might get a cheaper room at one of those places The valet parking is  dollars a day plus tax  Its confusing because when you pull up there is no parking  I went inside and found out I had to go to the Holiday Inn next door to talk to the valet which was a bit annoying  Staff was polite and helpful when asked  Room was very clean  Queen sized bed nice bathroom minimal things in room  Really no services like housekeeping which was fine with us only staying  days  A few plates and utensils  We liked the fridge for pop and beer  There is a little store in the lobby to buy goodies such as hot chocolate popcorn etc  Didnt use the DVD player  Neat counter bar to eat at in the full kitchen didnt use it at all  Linens and towels were luxuriousFree business center and free washer and dryer have to buy soap okay fitness centre  Small lobby with some brochures  Nothing too great  We werent in the hotel much so it didnt matter Cab ride to Crescent Street or Old Montreal about  Great if you just want somewhere to stay but then again you might get something cheaper and closer to the action if that is what you were looking for  We didnt mind walking or cabbing  We really didnt take advantage of the kitchen and other services laundry business centerExcellent for the price  Try hotwire under  stars    we actually paid more than  stars when I checked the night before    
P => Great value good location Just a follow up this is a great hotel in a good location  Large room with a queen bed  a sofasleeper a leather recliner a desk and a big TV and a DVD player with a free lending library of DVDs plus a full kitchen  Also a business center with free Internet and free self service laundry  Staff was very friendly and upbeat about Priceline Wow wish I could get deals this great all the time    
P => Delighted to write this review My reservations were made back when this hotel was Le Suites Faubourg St  Laurent and I  have been a bit confused when arriving if Id not spent the time to relocate it on Trip Advisor  Though Id confirmed our reservations a few days before our arrival a mistake had occurred and we arrived to find our reservation cancelled and apparently no vacancy  However Ricky at the front desk was efficient composed professional and reassuring that a solution would be forthcoming  After a short wait we were upgraded to their nicest two bedroom and perhaps last remaining suite which we called home for the next five days  I cant say enough good things about our stay here  The rooms were quiet very large with comfortable furniture three TVs views in two directions and a workable kitchen  I give thanks to the TA reviewer who alerted me that the kitchen cupboards contained minimal equipment so I arrived equipped with a few sharp knives cutting board spices and other basic cooking tools and ingredients  We easily entertained friends two nights with bags overloaded with cheeses pates salami and bread from Atwater ket Metro Lionel Groulx and a very nice IGA grocery store located a few blocks down the street  Great to have other rooms for the kids to watch TV or play cards or mini golf with a serving spoon tennis ball and a few pieces fo luggage delicately devised by by boys  Valet parking for this hotel is CAN plus tax so after the first night we moved our car to the parking garage under the Nationale Bibliotheque on Rue Berri just north of Maisonneuve for  day also a great tip from a TA member  The icing on the cake came when my  year old suddenly announced that he was completely out of clean clothes and we discovered free washer and dryers compliments of the hotel And when we ided to add an extra day to our stay in Montreal we were allowed to extend at the same rate wed reserved many months earlier  By the way our friends were staying in a lovely room at the Hyatt Regency but all agreed that our room was far superior in every way When we return to Montreal and I hope its soon we will again book a room here without a second thought

P => reasonable well located accommodation The hotel is an old building which has been updated with current fixtures is clean and has original art throughout giving it a pleasant atmosphere  my room which had quite a small window faced the back of the hotel looking out over the back alley through a corridor of two brick walls   the low light level made it a bit dreary during the day even though it was painted bright yellow  the sleeping room was spacious the bathroom very small and the closet contained a good sized safe  cleanliness was very good  the hotel is well located near transport clubs bars amp restaurants on rues st  denis and st  laurent  breakfast which is included is basic continental amp is a little on the skimpy side  I had little interaction with staff but they seemed courteous amp informative  
P => Never stay anywhere else  I have stayed at the Chateau twice over the past few years and I can honestly say I would never stay anywhere else when in Montreal  It looks like a converted mansion with all of the fireplaces and crown moulding from a long time ago  The rooms are nice and big the staff are really helpful and even include a small breakfast you can eat downstairs or take to your room Location is a short walk to the latin quarter and downtown is close too The price is right alot cheaper than the big chain hotels It is becoming my home in Montreal  
P => Hidden wonder Surprisingly not very many people are familiar with this little treasure    located on the very popular Sherbroolke Street      it is just a minutes walk from the Latin quarter of Montreal    so shopping theatre museums and dining are within waking distance  The staff are friendly and know enough english to easily assist guest who do not understand french    Taxis are very easy to get as this hotel is just across from the Grande Plaza     There is always at least two parked outside there  The subway metro is also close by and easy to use  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => A reason to go come back to Montreal This was our first time in Montreal and the Chateau DelArgoat was a pleasant surprise  The service was very friendly and helpful  The hotel itself was nice and quiet although its on a main street  The room was very clean but just a little cramped for four people  The location was great  The metro was across the street although we walked almost everywhere  It is very centrally located with many restaurants clubs and bars just steps away  The parking was a plus also  We parked our car on the first day and didnt use is again until we left four days later  The breakfast was O K  We would have a coffee or juice and something small but the best part was walking a block or two to a cafe and having coffee and a coissant outside while people watching  My husband and I plan to come back to Montreal ourselves and we would definitely stay here   
P => Felt like I lived in Montreal This hotel was the perfect place for my husbands and my vacation  We love urban exploring and the Chateau de lArgoat with a room that overlooked Sherbrooke allowed us to feel as if we were apart of the city while also giving a feeling of comfort and quiet when we needed to rest  Just blocks from the Metro and within walking distance to some great restaurants and the Just for Lhs Festival the hotel is perfectly located on the border of the Plateau and Latin Quarter  The staff is great the food is tasty and the parking cant be beat  Id definitely stay here again  
P => Lovely Boutique Hotel Great Staff Great Location We stayed at this wonderful establishment for three nights  Our room was bright and lovely clean and large with an exceptionally large bath which had an oversized tub  The common areas are nicely orated and the staff very welcoming and friendly  We particularly appreciated the secure off street parking located at the back door of the hotel  The continental breakfast was good but the dining area did tend to get quite crowded which was no more than a minor inconvenience at most The location is perfect particularly if you enjoy walking  One block away from Rue St  Denis which has restaurants and shops that seemingly go on for miles  About twenty minutes walk to Old Town Montreal which made for a great way to burn off some of the calories consumed at the wonderful restaurants located there  We also walked to Park Mount Royal which was approximately thirty minutes away  Climbing to the top of Mount Royal revealed a fabulous place with spectacular views of the city I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys the benefits amenities and personal touch to be found in a smaller establishment over the impersonality of large hotels  
P => Extremely helpful and friendly staff at a great price Some of the benefits of staying at Chateau de lArgoat are Extremely helpful and friendly staff   The hotel is centrally located   Subway station across the street  Excellent restaurants nearby on St Deny st   Delicious continental breakfast   Free parking  Clean roomsThe only con I had against the hotel was the bed was a little firmer then I like Overall my wife and would stay at Chateau de lArgoat again  
P => Great Value Convenient Location We stayed in room      there was lots of room to move around even with  adults and a small child  Bathroom is compact but its very new and clean and efficient  Free parking in the back they will likely hold your keys because of tandem parking  Breakfast is continental but its not self service  Theres a gal who warms the muffins and croissants etc  so that added service touch is nice  Theres usually fruit available as well and my husband who is a coffee snob actually liked the coffee  Great value  Subway is across the street  Youre a block from St Denis where there are a million restaurants and great nightlife  We walked everywhere its a mile or so to Old Montreal  
P => Very Impressive Breakfast Though the hotel looks old outside it is beautiful inside  Our room looked exactly the same as that appeared on their website  Free wireless internet is provided in room  The front desk service was fast  Every staff we dealt with spoke good English  They responded positively to our comments very quickly The breakfast is very nice with orange juice fruit coffee and different kinds of bagels muffins etc  There is a beautiful and polite young lady to serve you  You make your orders and she heats the bagel muffins etc  to make them tasty for you  You can also re order and even have your breakfast served inside your roomTravel information is provided in room amp posted at the breakfast area  We regret that we did not take a look at it earlier and missed a museum package with great value which included free visits to over  museums and a  days travel pass  The  day travel pass costs CAD itself and can be used on Bus amp Metro networks  The hotel is only a  minute walk to the Sherbrooke Metro Station  We have no difficulty at all in getting to all attractions with the travel pass  
P => Best place to stay in Montreal My husband and I have been staying at LArgoat for the past  years  We usually visit twice a year sometimes more  The staff are very friendly and helpful  The location is ideal  We park the car at the hotel and the rest of the time we walk bike or take the metro Sherbrooke Metro is just across the street  The price of the room includes breakfast and parking  You cant find a better deal anywhere else  Over the past  years we have stayed in several of the rooms  They were all nicely orated clean and peaceful  
P => Excellent value in a small hotel Wonderful small hotel at a reasonable price for a big city  An old converted house style of place  Clean comfortable home style rooms  The large bathroom its very large room is well worth the extra   Friendly and helpful staff  Continental breakfast non notable but OK  Parking multi rowed but a highly valued asset in a city with very limited parking  
P => Good value but nothing special I got one of the rooms facing the street  I was tired and slept well but mornings are noisy  Room is comfortable but small  Bathroom is tiny  Very close to the subway and on the fringes of downtown Montreal downtown is big so some might consider it a downtown place Breakfast is very simple   juice coffee or tea fresh fruit toast muffins or bagel so if you stay several days it is boring   and service was not fast  Breakfast room is tiny only four tables very close to each other so you feel you should eat as quickly as possible and get out of there  
P => Loved Chateau de lArgoat would definitely recommend Very friendly staff from the moment we made reservations  Very helpful when calling for directions to the hotel  Room and bathroom were very clean upon arrival  Free wireless internet which worked very well  Location was great a  minute walk to Metro Station and lots of restaurants and bars close by on Rue St  Denis  Breakfast was a good selection of bagels muffins breads croissants juice and coffee all very fresh  Plenty of available parking behind hotel  A very pleasant experience overall  
P => Funky clean friendly and great value My family includes one young child and one teenager  We booked the room with two double beds or queen but definitely more like doubles with standard bath and discovered its actually  adjoining rooms    perfect for putting my younger child to bed first  There is free internet hookup in the larger room and TV in both rooms  This room is on the ground floor near the reception desk and front door so I was worried about noise but it was actually quiet after  pm  Most guests seemed to be middle aged or older and came in early  Breakfast starts at  near the room so noise picked up by  am though we were up by then I found the breakfast to be substantial though heavy on carbs no fruit or protein  You can have seconds  The chocolate croissants are great tho tiny but you get  and can get a bagel or muffin also the muffins are not great The people at the desk were always very friendly and very helpful in advice  There is street noise on the first flor but more of traffic than of pedestrians since this hotel is at the end of the commercial section and at the start of a more residential or office section of Sherbrooke  The traffic noise wasnt bad at night The rooms that we looked into are all painted in cheerful colors seem to have been painted recently with original artwork and chandeliers in every room  The desks have standard hotel chairs  Our standard bath included a very deep tub and shower could be hand held  Nice lavender soap  I was thinking my parents in their s might like to stay on the first floor here but the tub is high for an older person to step in and out of Sherbrooke is well located for the Musee de Beaux Arts and McGill U which has a natural history museum if you take a bus or taxi straight down the street over  min walk but is a very short walk to the pedestrian zone with many restaurants  Its also a  min walk to the old city which we walked with our  year old    its downhill on the way there There is free parking  We had no trouble getting our car when we needed it despite valet parking situation  
P => The perfect place to be for a romantic night  PREFACEI searched and search for the right hotel I compared prices I looked at location I did it all  I was limited though my gf told me that she wanted a quotromantical nightquothaha so we needed a jacuzzi a large bed wine and isolation  I thought Montreal in the Winter time you can get anymore isolated and alone than that  It was so  I booked online via e mail with Argoat it was  for the Queen sized bed and double whirlpool bath MY TRIPI drove my fat American butt up from AlbanyNYUSA to MontrealAbout   hours  I ided that a GPS was a waste of money and probably just a hassle if I borrowed my moms  So I didnt   yea I got lost  Big time  The only number I had and the only person I knew was Gilles at the Chateau  I called the Chateau and I spoke with Gilles who was working there  He was the nicest and most patient person in the world after being lost for  hours on the phone with Gilles we became good friends  haha  The only thing about him was that he had an accent  So awhile of driving I got close to the hotel I thought Gilles was telling me to turn on quotsaint duber streetquot  I was drove all over and I called him back  or  times but I never saw a quotsaint duberquot on the right or left side  I said can you spell the street name for me   it was quotSaint Hubertquot   hahaha THE HOTELSo yea after that little mishap I arrived at the hotel  It was just like I had read about  It was small it felt cozy like someones house  You just feel comfortable there safe it reminds you of home  The room was done tastefully the bed was nice really nice  We got alot of use out if   if you know what Im saying  The hot tub which is not in the pictures was a lot of fun  We couldnt figure out how to get it work we called the front desk  The guy came up he thought it was broken  Turns out he had never used it before  He was going to upgrade our room from the one we had to the other larger jacuzzi suite  Then he figured it out theres a special button on the top of the tub  You wont notice it it looks almost hidden  Anyways it worked  I had my romantical night with my lady  The TUB and BATHROOM ARE HUGE Theres a walkin shower tooIf you are really interested PM me I have a video I took of the room The TV is small but if you are staying there for the reasons I was you wont be watching TV  It did have a DVD player which I used to play some jazz and other romantical music  Also parking was easy and free FOODIt was minus  degrees or less with the wind  So I didnt walk around at night or the next day  It took all the courage my gf and I had just to go across the street to the Hilton  At the Hilton is where I ate dinner and it was delicious I had a chicken burger a turkey club sandwhich and some french onion soup  Our server there was hilarious a real character  The bill came to around  sumtin Canadian for  drinksalcohol a soup and an  entrees  Great deal considering I would have payed double for that quality they offered The breakfast at the Chateau was also as described here  It was amazing  The coffee and juice was really good  I had a muffin crepes toast haha everything  NO WONDER Im a fat americanTHANK YOU CHATEAU de LArgoat 
P => What a great time We had originally intended to stay elsewhere while in Montreal but we found Chateau De LArgoat after we were screwed out of our intended destination Though we were choosing a hotel by running out of the car and checking roomsprices LArgoat was a perfect find  The rooms are ently cheap but vary heavily from an odd smaller room with an unattached but private bathroom just the one room a victim of the older architecture to sunny queen bed and jacuzzi affairs  It being late we opted for the jacuzzi which still put the room down cheaper than our original booking LArgoat has three floors attached by stairs  There is no elevator or handicapped ramp The only problem we had all stay was with the heat  With the outdoors so cold the Quebecois like it hot and we couldnt seem to make heater go below sub tropical  Cracking a window was a quick and very effective fix Breakfast in the morning is simple and french baked goods brought to order and coffee tea and juice  If youre really hungry youll have to head out into Montreal which is probably why youre there anyway The desk staff were friendly and courteous and basically run the entire place  Housekeeping is arate but the desk staff are also your parking attendants and waiters for breakfast The parking situation is a little house party style but it was free  You have to leave your keys at the desk because the lot out back can only fit enough cars if they park people in  We ided to trust them and they didnt ding up anything while we were there  But I could see it being inconvenient if you were in a hurry  The parking is also off of an un plowed back alley in Montreal  So if the forecast says snow leave your car in one of the covered lots down the street or youll be extending your stay a little while while the city thaws  
P => Great experience  Stayed here for a night in tember of   No complaints  Great service comfortable room and very conveniently located  Would definitely stay here again 
P => Loved it and will stay again We were happy off the bat that the Chateau offered parking as that seems to be a rarity in big cities  The parking is unique in the back so you have to give them your car keys so that they can move cars around if needed  The counter staff were helpful when we were looking to find a place we were interested in going  I was extremely pleased with the room  We stayed in room four which is on the ground floor and is actually two rooms  Perfect for two friends traveling together as we each had our own tv and privacy  The bed was very comfortable and I loved the down pillows  I really liked the hardwood floors wall colour mouldings and room chandelier  The continental breakfast was awesome with the best bagels ever  It is located in such a convenient location and I recommend people using the subway if they are going to the shopping district  I plan to stay here again and recommend it to all my friends and family  
P => GREAT Was at conference in Montreal for a week and wanted somewhere small and convient at good price This place was great The location good opposite metro station near bus station and walking distance to latin and village quarters Staff at reception amazing and very helpful friendly Room   a little orangered for my taste but clean and quiet Breakfast simple and in good atmosphere definitly enough to start the day Again back to reception staff  very accomadating and nothing too much bother  left my case there for four days as went on side trip to Washington DC Art in Hotel is great Am in Montreal every  years for conference and will be back here  
P => BED BUGS   BEWARE Good hotel excellent location everything was fine until I got struck by bed bugs Avoid room  which is the one just left of the reception area  There are two rooms the bugs struck in the main bedroom  Happened on  ober   
P => Friendly staff We had the large room on the main floor in the front of the hotel with a jetted tub The room was large and comfortable  A nice sitting area and a new TV  The bath had both the jetted tub and a shower  Even though it overlooked Sherbrooke St   it was not noisy  The best part of the hotel were the friendly front desk staff  The young lady that greeted us when we arrived was so friendly and helpful with lots of suggestions on what to do and see that evening  The chap that checked us out was also very friendly The morning breakfast was ok but nothing to get excited about  
P => Perfect for us My husband and I spent  nights at LArgoat and found it fit our requirements perfectly small amp quiet free parking internet access metro stations nearby one right across the street another about a  blk walk good continental breakfast in quaint little breakfast room interesting neighborhood with lovely Parc la Fontaine within easy walking distance  I dont know how close the nearest resaurant is as we had lunch and dinner while we were touring Montreal but we did enjoy drinks in the bar of the Double Tree across the street  The staff of Chateau LArgoat were friendly and helpful  We think this hotel is a real bargain and have recommended it to friends  
P => Loved it  I simply loved this hotel  It is located in front of the Sherbrooke metro station and its a  minute walk to Berri UQAM where you can catch the airport shuttle The staff was friendly and helpful the room clean and comfortable and I loved the breakfast orange juice bagels toasts muffins coffee and tea  There is also a computer available for customers Altogether a  star experience  
P => Cute Hotel Enjoyable Stay  My husband and I enjoyed our  day stay at this hotel in late ust   The hotel is outside Vieux Montreal but the Sherbrooke metro station is just a  minute walk up the street which makes getting around the city convenient  The staff at the front desk were very friendly provided us with good directions and were very knowledgeable about the metro system and buses to Quebec City  There is a free continental breakfast bagels muffins croissants juice and coffee which is served by a waitress in a little breakfast room  The sesame bagels were quite good  Our room had a queen bed and a standard bathroom I think it was room   The bed was a bit hard but the bathroom was very large bright and airy with a big bathtub  The room faced the back of the hotel so it was pretty quiet  Be sure to notice all the cool abstract artwork throughout the hotel  The hotel does not have an elevator which could present a problem for some people  Overall we were very happy with the hotel and would stay there again  
P => Loved this quaint hotel I had read reviews of this hotel in TripAdvisor and it was recommended in their Montreal Trip Guide  I was not disappointed  We had a large corner room Room  which had a very large bathroom  The bed was very comfortable and the maid service was good  The only caveat is that there was no glass real or plastic in the room so be sure to ask for one  We asked for one the first night but forgot to ask for one the second and the maid took our glass from the night before  The continental breakfast which is included is just that a choice of croissant muffin or bagel juice and tea or coffee  It was fresh and the muffins were huge  The hotel is located a little bit away from the main part of town but right across the street from the metro station  The best part is that the hotel provides FREE parking behind the hotel and this is a great benefit as many of the hotels either dont provide parking or charge a pretty penny for it  The desk clerks were very helpful and courteous There are no elevators so if you have trouble climbing stairs be sure to ask for a room on the first floor  We got our exercise going up and down two flights of stairs  
P => Really cool hotel  We stayed at this hotel in for  days spanning ey of this year for our honeymoon and really loved it  We booked a small room and in retrospect we should have gotten a larger one for such a lengthy stay but it was adequate and very cute  The hotel staff was very pleasant  The breakfast was excellent every day I could have taken dozens of the chocolate pastry home with me  The parking was tight as others have mentioned but the desk staff always happily moved cars around and it wasnt really an issue since we were across the street from a metro stop anyway  The hotel is located nearby to some great and vegetarian friendly restaurants  My husband and I are really laid back and low maintenence so this low frills place was cool for us and a great value  On our budget it was a great alternative to some soul less chain  
P => Great Value As many have mentioned before you just cannot beat the value and location this hotel provides  My wife and I stayed here for three nights in mid ust and we had a wonderful time  The metro subway is literally across the street and shopping on St Denis and St Laurent streets are only a couple of blocks away  The metro stop for the most visited part of the city Old Montreal is only a ten minute subway ride  We spent hours roaming the neighborhoods and dining in restaurants around the hotel  The room was clean and inexpensive in relation to the national chains in the city  The bathroom was rather large room  and private  The breakfast usually comprised of muffins or bagels was good and parking out back is free  A couple of things to keep in mind though there is no elevator which could be a problem for people who have trouble with stairs and the bed was sagging a bit in the middle  As long as one takes into consideration that this is not a full service hotel you will be happy with your stay at this establishment  
P => Loved the Chateau LArgoat This was a great hotel experience  We stayed for nights in y   The front desk staff was always very friendly and helpful  Free breakfast was tasty and it was a nice touch having it served  The first room we were in was a bit on the small side however when the airconditoning failed we were immediatley moved to another room which was quite a bit bigger  Both rooms very comfortable with interesting colour schemes  The location is fantastic very close to all of the sights  A short walk to Rue St Denis for many restaurant and shopping choices  I cannot recommend this hotel enough 
P => Great Little Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for  nights and were very impressed with the size and the cleanliness of the room for the price the bathroom looked as though it was recently reated with a large tub and updated fixtures  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly with directions and we were really happy with the free wireless internet and parking although with the close proximity of the metro our rental car stayed in one spot for the duration of our stay  The one big issue we found was the state of the bed and bedding  The mattress was extremely hard which made for a difficult good nights sleep the bedding itself also looked a little threadbare and in need of replacement  Overall I would say that our stay was very nice but would probably stay some place else on our next visit  
P => absolutely fabulous We stayed at the Chateau de lArgoat for four nights last month and I cant begin to describe the value of this hotel  Ill try though  Upon arrival we met the ever nice and over helpful Gregore who directed us to our room   which turned out to be a big room a smaller one and arate bathroom and toilet rooms  Everything was spotlessly clean  The hotel location is as said before right across the street from the metro station though we discovered that for five people its actually not more expensive to take a big taxi    The breakfast was simple but very tasty and the staff was the friendliest staff ive ever seen anywhere  Gregore Gilles the girl from Quebec city whose name I forgot and everyone else they were all there whenever we needed something no matter what always with a smile and great will to help  We never met the hotel owner but I would like to congratulate her for picking such a good staff For sumy unless youre looking for a large chain type hotel you could not be wrong by choosing the Chateau de lArgoat  We will definitely stay there again if and when were in Montral 
P => The best place to stay in Montreal We satyed at the Chateau for  nights and it was a great experince  The staff was excelent always in a very good mood and the service was just perfect  The hotel felt like home  The room number  was very quiet and roomy  The bathroom was very big and there was space for everything  The only problem was the bed not very comfortable  The location was perfect just  blocks from St  Denis where there are lots of good restaurants and one block from the metro station  Every thing was very good about this hotel and I would really recomend it  
P => Impressive Stayed at Chateau de lArgoat during the Just for Lhs festival and was quite impressed  No this isnt a five star property and the room we stayed in was fairly small with a very hard bed but it was clean and quiet and the staff really made us feel welcome The free parking and free continental breakfast were a big plus and the price was a fraction of what the major commercial hotels were charging As others have said the location really makes this hotel a winner  Its a block from the Metro subway a block from a major bus station and within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and shops including St  Laurent and Ste  Catherine streets Overall this place is a real winner  Book it before others do 
P => My Hotel of Choice in Montreal The LArgoat is a small modest hotel near the Latin Quarter in Montreal  It is near Sherbrooke and St  Denis   not far from the University of Quebec at Montreal UQAM  It is walking distance from the local bus depot good for getting to and from the airport and two blocks from the nearest subway station I discovered LArgoat a few years ago while staying across the street at a larger more commercial hotel that has changed names many times since then usually a chain like Shearton or something like that  The LArgoat has  rooms but it feels much smaller  There is always a continental breakfast every morning with juice fruit rolls and beverages  I buy my own cereal and yogurt and keep it in the fridge in the small kitchen There is no elevator so I have never stayed higher than the nd floor  The rooms are clean and depending on the one you take adequate for a few nights stay I always look into other rooms in hotels when they are being cleaned  I like the back because it is quieter than the front rooms that face the street  The staff has always been friendly and bi lingual during my two stays there  I believe there is also guest parking but since Montreal is so maneurable by public transportation I have only rented a car there once when I stayed with friends who were not centrally located  There is a lounge with a free computer for accessing the Internet and machines for snacks and beverages  There are many restaurants on St  Denis and on other side street nearby  I am a  year old retired bachelor  Im a bit fussy  But I would recommend this hotel to anyone who does not mind walking up stairs if you take a room on a higher floor and whose needs are simple  My rooms have all had TV air conditioner desk with phone and bathroom with tub and shower combination  And the hotel has wonderful ambiance  
P => Book this one now Best location in Montreal   away from downtown across the street from the metro and within walking distance of bustling St  Denis many eateries parks boutiques etc  Leave your car in their free lot and take the metro anywhere you want to go in Montreal  Lovely super clean small European style hotel with the graciousness of any  star accomodation Gilles and Fanny front desk staff   you rock They allowed us to leave water bottles in their refrigerator and even loaned us umbrellas on a rainy day  Free internet access is so convenient and there is a very cute dining area that looks like a Parisienne cafe where you will be served continental breakfast  Our room was so quiet   I hadnt slept that well in a long time  Dont hesitate   book this gem now 
P => Charming and a bargain Came to town for Jazzfest and stayed a wonderful  nights at Chateau lArgoat with our  year old son  Staff were quite friendly and helpful even though we speak about  words of French among the  of us we never felt like that was an issue  Our room in the rear of the hotel was very comfortable light and quiet had a comfortable bed and was by far the cleanest hotel room Ive ever experienced  We loved the atmosphere  the whole building has great character and was obviously orated by someone with an excellent eye for color  a welcome change from the featureless chain hotel or the excessively cutesy inn  We also loved the locally made soaps and appreciated the full bodied black tea in the breakfast room a nice light breakfast is included  Free parking is also a major plus  yes the hotel keeps your keys but it was never a problem to get them back when we needed them  Overall we felt it was an excellent value especially for a place so centrally located    we enjoyed our stay and look forward to our return 
P => Good location for getting around This property is situated about  yards from Sherbrooke Metro underground train station which means you can get anywhere in Montreal easily  Get a  day tourist pass for about    Rue St Denis is just around the corner which offers plenty of restaurants and a great bar for beers  Brasseurs who brew their own beers  Get a pitcher for good value The room was a ent size overlooking the car park at the rear so not a very good view but that didnt bother us  The room was definitely tired  The carpet was grubby and due for replacement  The areas that should be sealed in the bathroom had tile grout instead and this had all cracked with some being non existent  The whole bedroom could do with refreshing but the bed was comfortable  The air conditioning was effective but too noisy to leave on at bedtime English TV channels were limited but then the room is just a base really Although this is a non smoking hotel on a couple of occasions we noticed the smell of cigarettes in the hallway whilst going up to our room  And worse still the unmistakable smell of cannabis also on a couple of occasions  Thankfully we couldnt smell anything when we entered our room as the doors are solid also preventing hallway noise from being heard whilst inside Breakfast is included but will only keep you going for a couple of hours as it comprised of items such as muffins  miniature crossants or chocolate au pain  You get to choose just one though but you can also get a piece of fruit as well  That said the muffins were very tasty particularly the blueberry and maple ones  They microwave the muffins so I asked for one cold  It was cold alright as it must have come straight out of the fridge hence the microwaving The staff were friendly and helpful and were happy to speak english Unless I knew that I was getting a reated room I wouldnt use this hotel again but can higlhy recommend its location  
P => Fabulous and affordable We spent a weekend here on a vacation last summer and found this splendid hotel that occupies an old and unpretentious building at the edge of the Latin Quarter  Our rates were under  per night for a nice room with a street view  The rooms were clean and tidy  We really enjoyed the morning breakfast and the staff there are so friendly we will definitely go back when were in Montreal next 
P => Great Value  Based on other reviews this was the only hotel I wanted to stay at when we planned our trip to Montreal   and I wasnt dissapointed The hotel itself is in a very convenient location metro stop across the street tons of restos and shops nearby it was very clean the staff were very helpful especially since our French is extremely limited and the breakfasts were good  We requested a quiet room on the non smoking floor   and it was very nice and bright with a HUGE whirlpool bathtub  It was mostly quiet   one night there was a little party going on down the street final Canadiens playoff game so we closed the window and turned on the ac and we couldnt hear anything  My only dissapointment was with the bed   it definitely sagged in the middle a bit so it wasnt as comfortable as it could have been  The breakfast room is indeed on the small side although I loved the posters for all the local showsexhibitionsetc  on the wall   but you can call down to have a tray put together for you that you can enjoy in your room and that worked out brilliantly  The pain au chocolate as great and the muple muffins were delicious All in all I highly recommend this place 
P => Good price and clean I stayed here for  days in il  The hotel was very clean and my room although meant to be a small room was actually really big which was impressive  It had European charm which is what I was looking for The price was excellent although my bed and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable which made the jetlag recovery a little more difficult  I too found the maid vacuuming outside my room every morning a little annoying but the staff were friendly and it was reasonably close to everything As I was travelling on my own I would have preferred a better concerige type service  I did ask about tours etc but didnt find them much help to be honest not compared to the other hotels I stayed at in other parts of Quebec  I think part of the issue was that I only speak basic french I would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel perhaps travelling in a group or with a set itinary There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel which would have been a bonus but Rue St Denis is only two blocks away so it is fairly close  
P => A nice little hotel I booked this room via the hotels internet site with no trouble at all and chose it based on the reviews on Trip Advisor Overall I really liked the hotel  It was in a very convenient area directly across the street from the Sherbrooke metro station and a short walk from Berri Uqam  It is also a short walk from the Village area of Ste  Catherines Street which can be a bit dicey if youre not expecting to be there as we wereThey offer a continental breakfast and the service of the breakfast was very quick and efficient  The staff were all very conscientious and polite  The dining room was small but there was usually room enough for everyone who wanted to eat  There were lovely posters in the dining room advertising events around Montreal We stayed in Room    I was surprised each day when I opened the door to realize that it smelled like pickles It wasnt unpleasant but it was unusual  This room has two double beds each in arate rooms and both beds were extremely hard  We stayed for a week and the hardness of the beds took a bit of getting used to  The beds were made up with blankets and light quilts which were nice The bathroom was new and tiled to within an inch of its life  It was kept very clean and well stocked with towels and other necessities  A nice touch was the q tips and make up pads in the bathroom vanity Overall I would recommend this hotel and would likely stay again  However I would want to ensure that the room I booked had softer beds 
P => A lovely little spot not fancy but nice My son and I had a little trip to Montreal over spring break and we were overall very pleased with this hotel  All the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful  Our room was on the main floor and was perfect since it had two connecting rooms  The breakfast was adequate and the muffins were definitely the best of the offerings  The beds were a trifle hard though my son liked that  We did have some confusion with directions and they told us that the LExpress restaurant was walkable    which it was technically but not so much fun in  degrees and a stiff wind  One thing about Montreal that shocked me was how few of the sidewalks were shoveled despite the fact that they have had one of the snowiest winters on record  The sidewalk outside the hotel was nicely shoveled but everything else was worth your life  We frequently walked in the street and were not surprised to see lots of people on crutches Overall a very nice place to stay at a nice price  
P => a wonderful place in a great location This is such a gem and really a bargain too  It is a wonderful old building    must have been a grand house  We stayed in rm   which is a two bedroom suite  Gorgeous wood panelling all around  The bed in the back room was somewhat uncomfortable and we had a little trouble adjusting the heat    really the only complaints we had    minor  There is a certain funky ambience but in a good way    seems very European  It was clean and very quiet  The staff was extremely friendly and spoke perfect English but were willing to let me try out my French as well  The parking lot out back is small so they have to take your car keys so that they can move cars around for people to get out but they are very good about it  The breakfast was good    croissants pain au chocolat etc  The surrounding area is lots of fun    turn LEFT out the front door to get to the fun restaurants and shops  There is a metro station across the street and a bank down the block  If you crave a perfectly standard upscale hotel room book across the street at the Doubletree but if you want something with charm and character that really makes you feel like you are traveling stay at Chateau de lArgoat pronounce the o and the a arately oh ah 
P => Great Stay Great hotel  Wonderful location not far from old montreal or downtown we walked there everyday right across the street from the metro and a very short walk to rue st  denis and the main for plenty of restaurants and shopping  The rooms were cozy we stayed in a room with a Queen bed and a double whirlpool tub night  The staff was very friendly and the room very clean  I highly recommend anyone to stay here  
P => Interesting hotel We chose to book Room  as the quietest room in the house and we werent disappointed The room was clean and spacious although it smelled slightly of stale smoke  The bathroom was also large and had everything we needed You will need to be fit enough to use several flights of stairs if you want this room since there is no lift  Although we didnt need to ask I am sure the staff would be happy to help with bags if necessary Breakfast is served in a small dining room and comprised toast or a muffin or a bagel with fruit and coffeetea etc  You can also use the shared fridge etc There is a PC in the guest lounge for anyone to use Parking is free of charge but limited so be prepared to leave your keys as the staff move cars around to let everyone in and out as necessary The hotel is very close to Sherbrooke Metro stop with easy connections to everywhere in Montreal  It is also an easy walk to lots of places to eat of varying quality and price The staff are all very friendly and speak both English and French  Our car was ready for us to leave extremely early on our final day and breakfast was supplied to go  
P => Great little hotel   excellent value for the money This hotel is very well located across the street from the Sherbrooke subway station on the orange metro line and a short walk from the Berri metro station on the green line  You can easily walk to Old Montreal from here but if you have stamina and enjoy walking you can pretty much get to all of the major sites on foot from this location  What I really liked also about this place was the staff whom I would describe as friendly and very accommodating In the room rate you get free parking a ent continental breakfast served from  AM until noon every day free wireless Internet for those travelling with a laptop as well as free local calls The rooms themselves are OK bathrooms are small and dated but kept clean   the same goes for towels and bedding and the fresh scent of the linen more than makes up for its age I booked my room directly from the hotel website   at the time their site did not differentiate between smoking and non smoking rooms so until they update their website it might be a good idea to call the hotel directly to enquire before booking a room Please also note that the hotel has recently started reating   the first floor where my room was located was being redone when I stayed  Since I was there on a Saturday night there was no actual work going on at the time still the management upgraded me to a larger room to make up a bit for the poor appearance of the hallway A very nice stay indeed   highly recommended for the price 
P => Great Price Great Location Euro Style Hotel Was very impressed with this place  The rooms were quite small but clean and cozy  The location was great for dining over on rue St  Denis Check out Chez Laurent   very good fish  Parking lot was small but I had a compact car so no problem  The price   man for a little over  bucks you cant go wrongThey do alot of their paperwork with real paper including index cards and an old fashioned credit card embosser and naturally they lost my reservation but still they got me another room with courteous service  Crossaints in the morning for breakfast was a welcome treat as was the tasty pot of coffee kept continuously filled Overall I would highly recommend this place   even to a business traveller who wants somethign a little more interesting than the average riott of Doubletree trappings  
P => Delightful boutique hotel After much research I settled on this hotel for our  day getaway to Montreal  We didnt arrive until midnight but we were welcomed very warmly and given Room   It was a bit cozy but the room was exceptionally clean  This room faced Sherbrooke so there was a good bit of road noise  As a result we asked for a quieter room the next day and were given Room   What a difference This is said to be the quietest in the hotel and it definitely was  It is also very spacious with a very large bathroom  Again everything was very clean  The kicker for us was the memory foam mattress on the queen bed  heavenly My husband and I are normally early risers but we found ourselves sleeping about  hours a day every day The mattress was that comfortable  Of course we spent a lot of time walking every day so I guess we needed the rest  The staff was kind enough to loan us umbrellas on the rd day when the weather turned from gloriously sunny and warm to a rather chilly rainy day  I must also mention the yummy continental breakfast with really good coffee fresh baked muffins and croissants including pan au chocolat as well as fresh fruit and OJ  The dining room attendant was very friendly and helpful  This hotel is across the street from the Doubletree so you can easily grab a taxi if you want but the Metro station is right there and it really is the best way to get around  The bus station is just  blocks away if you want to catch the Aerobus to the airport  In sumy a great hotel with great staff and a great location  whats not to like 
P => European charm with lots of value I had a really nice stay here and thought it was a wonderful value with free breakfast free parking and free internet  It is a small European style hotel in a charming refurbished set of adjacent rowhomes  The room was not large but certainly a comfortable size with pretty French style or and a comfy leather sofa  The bed was a little bit saggy but it had a down feather bed and plenty of comfy pillows  I am picky about bathrooms and I adored this one because it was so roomy and spotlessly clean with modern fixtures a shower stall and a whirlpool tub  My only quibble would be a slight musty odor coming from around the dresser area but the rest of the room and the bedding did not have this odor  The TV had a full complement of cable stations in both languages and the best part was that this room was really quiet try to get one facing away from the street  You could sleep really well there The staff were very helpful and relaxed in a good way  Feel free to ask them for maps and advice  The continental breakfast was wonderful with fresh squeezed orange juice and a nice selection of pastries which they serve warmed to order  I suggest the huge and delicious maple muffin  The location was easy to drive to and although initially it seemed kind of out of the way from the conventional downtown area where most hotels are it turns out this location is even better because of its proximity to the best hippest neighborhood in Montreal the Plateau which just a short walk away north on St  Denis  You can also go south on St  Denis into the Latin Quarter which is like the St ks Place of Montreal  If you keep going south it gets a little seedier into their Red Light District but it still feels quite safe  The Sherbrooke metro obviously also is just a block away and connects easily to everything  You are just a few stops away from the lovely Old Montreal district and Chinatown and if you can visit the heart of the Plateau by going one stop to Mont Royal  You can transfer at Berri Uqam to the green line and visit the rest of downtown Montreal and the McGillSaint Catherine area for mainstream shopping and museums the nice Montreal Fine Arts museum is free this fall You can get a tourist day or  day pass for the metro All in all this is a great place to stay in Montreal with the personal quiet feel of a B and B but the amenities of a hotel  Montreal is a mellow but posh city with awesome food and a unique vibe  You get the French culture without the attitude which is great and everyone easily goes bilingual there  Its too bad that the US dollar is weaker than the Canadian one right now so its not quite the bargain it once was but its still a great place to visit  
P => Fantastic small hotel great location The Chateau de lArgoat is located next to some really funky parts of Montreal Rue St Denis and the Plateau  Theres some lovely shops nearby and some nice restaurants and bars  Its also really well located for public transport   Sherbrooke metro But of the hotel itself    its relatively small which adds a certain charm to the place  Our room was large with a nice bathroom two bedrooms with ent comfortable beds  The breakfast was very good and plentiful   with friendly service  The reception was very good and friendly on arrival and throughout the stay and with us not speaking French too    I also liked the loungeinternet room   had quite a hostel feel in a friendly good way and meant I could research the next hotel and what to do there easily and for free There were four of us staying in the hotel and we had a lovely stay and would strongly recommend it to others  If you do stay there we hope you enjoy it as much as we did  
P => Friendly staff The owners were very kind and helpful during our stay  The room was cosy and clean  And the bathtub was a great treat after a whole day walking through the city It is very well located near several restaurants shops and public transportation the subway station is just across the street The only problem was with the wi fi internet conection that just did not work at all in our room no    It worked well in the breakfast room though  And in the end it was nice to seat there to use my laptop have a cup of coffee and chat with other guests  
P => Great place close to everything Chateau de lArgoat was a wonderful place for my wife and I on our honeymoon  Some of the highlights   Friendly staff  We put our cake in the fridge as well as some cheese we bought at the local grocery store  Anything we wanted they were able to help with  Mornings we were greeted by smiling breakfast staff  Everyone is bilingual here so dont worry if your French is weak  If you need something just ask they never said no to my requests   Location  The hotel is steps from the Sherbrooke metro stop as well as bus lines  We were also within   minutes of highly rated restaurants like Lexpress and Au Pied de Cochon  The Latin quarter is also right next door  We walked at night and the area is lively even at pm at night felt completely safe   Room  We had room  which was on the first floor  Bright green walls hardwood floors and a nice big jacuzzi bath with shower  The bed and sheets were nice pillows be a bit flat but thats a persons preference  We slept very nicely  Also wireless internet is available or a hotel computer which is wired can be had by all guests   Not really a negative but when you park which is free you give your keys to the front desk and they move your car as needed for other guests to get in or out  We didnt need our car while we were here but if you plan on taking yours out let the front desk know so you can the correct parking spot 
P => First rate establishment If there were a grade between quotabove averagequot and quotexcellentquot on this website this hotel would deserve it I would give it a   or    The rooms were clean and tidy and the staff was friendly nobody lhed at my Yankee French   and helpful  When I was there the guests seemed to consist mostly of Francophone people from Quebec the locals seem be able to detect a good place when they see one  
P => A Fine Establishment Like many others my wife and I stayed at the Chateau de lArgoat based on the reviews on Trip Advisor  The hotel is in a fantastic location making it easy to enjoy the fine eating establishments on St  Denis Duluth and Rachel  The free parking free internet service WiFi for those with laptops but theres a computer on site for public use and its free of charge and complimentary continental breakfast are also added benefits The room itself was quite nice with art nouveau or  The mattress however could have used replacing and the bathroom could use some touch ups The staff was friendly and attended to our needs  Denis in particular was very animated and helpful Overall an excellent stay  
P => Probably one of the best in Montreal First off I want to say that the staff was absolutely wonderful  Every day they greeted us with smiles and asking how we were doing  Breakfast was just enough although we could have probably had a few more choices  The location of the hotel is perfect  Just a few blocks from the most busy streets of Saint Denis and St Laurent  We went on those streets for dinner almost every night  More importantly however the hotel is just across the street from the Metro station which I would highly recommend for traveling within the city  This was a wonderful experience 
P => Great little hotel overflowing with hospitality My wife and just spent ust rd through ust th  nights in one of the Argoats most reasonably priced smaller rooms Cnight  taxes  The stay was in conjuction with the full Rogers Cup tennis tournament and we are seasoned old American travelers who had never been to Montreal before arriving by car We found the stay memorable an impeccably clean room fully functioning free wireless service in room local phone calls free  calls to the States copious and delicious continental breakfast no hassle free parking staff moves cars around crowded rear parking on their own across the street from the Sherbrooke Metro entrance walking distance to major restaurants on St  Denis and St  Laurent and above all the kindest most helpful staff you can imagine constantly ready to go that extra mile in researching a restaurant or helping us with our itinerary plans Bonne continuation a tout le monde qui travaille au sein dun si merveilleux petit hotel 
P => A terrific experience what a great value I stayed in this terrific hotel in early ust  I was very pleasantly surprised due to the quality and overall value of this hotel  The Chateau De LArgoat has a very European character all the rooms are well orated and very unique  The customer service is outstanding  All the staff members were above and beyond to make my experience as enjoyable as possible  The location of the hotel is wonderful  The hotel also offered a very good continental breakfast  They offered chocolate croissants croissants bagels toasts fruits juice coffee etc  When I slept in they even put food for me on the side and kept it fresh in case I wanted to eat This excellent hotel is within walking distance to Old Montreal Latin Quarter Mount Royal Saint Catherine Street Saint Laurent Street and all the restaurants on Duluth and Prince Arthur Street  The hotel has free and safe parking for your car  They also offer complimentary wireless internet access in the rooms and a computer with internet access by the dinning room  My room was very ample with a queen size bed and a large bathroom  it was located on the rd floor towards the back of the hotel  It was also immaculate the lady that cleaned my room kept my room very very clean  I never saw a cleaning crew so dedicated and hard working My room and my friends room were perfectly cleaned everyday  They do not have refrigerators available for the rooms yet they gladly allowed me to keep ice and drinks in the hotels refrigerator  They can also get you a bucket with ice and wine glasses upon your request I strongly recommend this hotel and I cannot wait to go back  I thank all the staff members of this cozy and lovely hotel for enhancing my wonderful stay in the joy and most amazing city of Canada Beautiful Montreal quotjoie de vivrequot  
P => Good Location and near Subway I stayed for  nights in Montreal and booked that Hotelbecause of the reviews where made   I had a room with  Queen sized beds I have to say that I was quite surprised First the room is way above average for a normal Hotel Also it is like in the style of an old Montreal TownhouseMansion   The room was in a very good shape and clean The Bathroom was great double the size than of a  Star Hotel   they are usually smallThat room we had had actually  erate rooms so it can be closed by a door PS  Good for  guys looking for Chicks for a night heheA little negative point was that in the nd room were the stairs above but I think normal people with a good common sense do not have problems with that So I would say if you go you get your Value and Enjoyment therePS  The Staff is also quite helpful in matters of giving you a Map etc    If needed 
P => Great for the Price My wife and I stayed there in mid y for a few days  Very nice accomodations although they did not blow you away either  Good charming rooms with an old fashion flair  Not many extras like an iron or fridge  but as they say they want to keep their prices low and that is how they do it  Knowing that it was a great stay  I loved their breakfast  they had a continental breakfast with service    the croissants were nice and hot as were there muffins  The service overall was fantastic everyone was very helpful and with a smile  My favorite was the guy with the swirly mustache   he was awesome  He helped us with restaurants sites and a good place to change money  Location was good as well  A  minute walk from the heart of downtown or a two or three stop metro to Old Montreal  The metro stop is literally across the street  Plus the bustling St  Denis St  is around the corner  Only con was our room was right by the breakfast room so we did hear some noise but it wasnt enough to make it a bad stay  Basically if you want to get away from the chain feel and want something with charm this is the place to be and the price is right  
P => We keep coming back year after year Ive been coming here since around   years and theres a reason for it and our most recent visit  days for the Jazzfest around y th was no different  I came here alone when I was single my husband and I stayed here together and we recently went with our toddler and our experience has always been good there  I will say its less a family oriented hotel that is less oriented toward small children than some hotels e g  theres no elevator and its got a quiet elegant European feel not stuffy just nice and relatively quiet   so the reason I say its less family oriented is a compliment to the hotel and one reason my husband and I loved coming here as a couple its fairly romantic but the staff was wonderfully helpful set up a portable crib and we didnt even ask for one had driven up with our own helped us find a babysitter for one night out she was lovely and very competent and patient with our sometimes loud toddler  Given the US Cnd exchange rate now the price for some of the rooms is less of a bargain but thats a Canada wide problem not specific to this hotel  Overall my experience at this hotel has been consistently good for many years including last week  
P => Chateau de lArgoat is a winner My first visit here although my fiancee has stayed at this property  times prior  Very clean rooms very helpful staff  Close to Metro  Walking to attractions restaurants not a problem  Ask for a room in the back if you think traffic noises would be a problem we had one in the back and it was very quiet  Ill stay there again on my next visit  
P => It brings a smile to my face For the first time ever during my travels have I experienced such wonderful hospitality during a hotel stay  The entire staff was consistently helpful pleasant and extremely knowledgeable of the area  The property is immaculate   it would pass a white gloves test didnt see or feel a speck of dust anywhere  We stayed in room    great room with a huge sunny bathroom and an extra room with a daybed  Our mornings couldnt have began any brighter in the cozy breakfast area where you can choose from an assortment of fresh pastries teas coffee and juice  We only stayed three days but would love to visit Montreal again and will most definitely stay at the Chateau de lArgoatP S  The Latin quarter is just a block away and for a great deal on a late breakfast lunch or just a snack try the Cafe Expresso on the corner of St  Denis and Ontario  
P => Great Stay   loved it We had an excellent experience at this hotel The staff is so helpful and the hotel and rooms are clean  Its also a great value Highly recommended 
P => Chateau De LArgoat    What A Great Find Stayed here for a wonderful long weekend and could have not been more impressed  room was spacious and clean    nice to feel quotat homequot instead of in that sterile hotel atmosphere  staff were amazing    very hospitable and friendly  the location is about as central to everything as you can get    we walked everywhere    but if you need the metro is right across the street   tons of restaurants clubs and shopping nearby on St Laurent and St  Denis  We will definitely be returning to the Chateau de LArogoat the next time we are in Montreal    and will be spreading the word about this fantastic place  
P => Absolutely Charming This hotel is absolutely charming and gives you a lovely and warm european feel  The rooms are small but nicely orated to the match this charming hotel  Had room   with the hot tub it was very nice  The hotel is quiet and conveniently located to many nice restaurants on St  Denis and St  laurent The bistro style room where they have continental breakfast is so nice Staff very accomodating  
P => What a cute hotel This was my first time using trip advisor as a reference  I chose this hotel because it was the least expensive highest rated hotel  My boyfriend and I had room   It had a large bathwhirlpool and a arate shower  The room seemed old but that just added to its charm  The bed was very comfortable and they provided local lavender bar soap as well as unlabbed but nice smelling liquid soaps  The man at the counter was polite enough and when we walked in with a bottle of wine he offered us wine glasses and a cork screw  The bed was verysoft and comfortable  They also offer free internet near the lobby In the morning we sat down for breakfast and they brought out warm bagels delicious and warm croissants  We were right across the street from the sherbrooke metro and bought a museum pass as well as a metro pass for  days for a total of  each  The chateau is only  blocks from St Denis street and about  blocks from St Laurant street    both are lively streets with lots of restaurants and bars  I would highly recommend this hotel the staff really try their best to please their customers 
P => Best value in town Stayed at Chateau LArgoat for the F Grand prix weekend on     when any Hotel room is hard to come by and the rates go way up the Days Inn was looking for night  This place is an outstanding value with good quality clean rooms and great bathrooms  Breakfast and friendly service included for just night  This place is a find   
P => Made for a perfect stay in Montreal We were really pleased that we booked this hotel  Our twin room was spacious and elegantly orated  The bathroom was spotless and the whirlpool bath was a nice treat after a long days sight seeingThe friendly staff and free internet use were major plus points Breakfast was of the light continental variety  You choose from muffinpain au chocolatcroissanttoast and help yourself to teacoffee and fresh fruit One thing for people with heavy luggage to bear in mind is that there is no lift  
P => Great Place We were traveling with a baby and wondered how we would fare  As it turned out we could not have chosen a better place I requested a room off the back and we were given a nice room with a little side room for the baby  The staff were the nicest Ive ever dealt with at any hotel  They absolutely went out of their way to make us at home and loved the baby  They have a little kitchen there and offered that we could use the refrigerator for baby supplies  Staff restaurant recommendations were excellent as well  They even offered to have someone have coffee ready for us the day we were leaving and had to be out by  am You can hardly get any closer to the center of Montreal than the Chateau de lArgoat  Its a quick drive to Vieux Montreal if you want or the Sherbrooke Metro stop is right across the street and you can get nearly anywhere from there Well definitely stay there the next time were in Montreal  
P => Pleasant This hotel is located in a very happening part of Montreal for all to enjoy  Rue St  Denis is only a block away which has plenty for anyone to do and St  Laruante is about a  minute walk  The location of this hotel was great  The service was very good  The continental breakfest consisted of a bagel and coffeecant anyone ever be a little more generous  Some of the rooms might have a slight oder but nothing to raunchy  It is also across from the orange metro stop  
P => A gem Dont stay anywhere else I did all of my research for accommodation on Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed  I stayed at Chateau de lArgoat for  nights from the nd to the th of ruary  I couldnt have asked for a better place to stay  It was very clean with rooms serviced daily  I never had one problem in my time there  The owners and their staff were very very helpful with directions information even letting me use the fridge when I needed to  The complimentary breakfast in the mornings had choices of bagels muffins croissants and the especially delightful pains au chocolat The internet access is free also I never had to wait to use it which is a big plus I highly recommend this place to anybody it is a perfect base for visitors to Montreal  The convenience of having the Sherbrooke Metro station literally across the road is a big big plus Thanks Chateau de lArgoat you made my time in Montreal all the more enjoyable I will be back soon  
P => Loved it I loved everything about this hotel From the moment we walked in the staff was so nice and helpful  They even gave my a box of of fancy lotions and soaps as a quotholiday presentquot since our stay was right after Christmas The location cant be beat  There are tons of restaurants and cafes in the area for all tastes  Many attractions are in walking distance or only a stop or two away on the subway which is only a couple of blocks from the hotel The breakfast is really just a quick bite    tea or coffee and a choice of bread  I have to say though those maple muffins they have are delicious and they even heat them upI usually like to try new hotels when I return to places but I liked this place so much I doubt I would even bother looking elsewhere on my next visit to Montreal  
P => Charming and Affordable Nice clean comfortable rooms in a great location  The hotel has a friendly and informative staff and its located near a subway stop  Plus some great restaurants and shopping are nearby We loved the chocolate croissants in the morning too  
P => it IS very good Yes our room was small and had a tiny bath  But that is as hard as our criticism will get  The Chateau Argoat is in a prime location has very friendly helpful and well informed staff we were given a clean cozy and well maintained room with two comfortable beds and had free parking plus a well above average continental breakfast included in our   thinking of other North American cities   surprisingly ent if not low rate  It s a place that made us feel good in a large city unknown to us  What better a starting point can you ask for We loved it there and would and hopefully will return there any time  Highly recommended 
P => Really Enjoyed this Place We spent  nights at the Chateau LArgoat in tember Our room was quaint yet spacious and comfortable  The bathroom was large and the bedroom was clean  The breakfast of muffins chocolate croissants and coffee was good  The hotel also offers free internet access which we took full advantage of  The hotel is in a good location   only a  minute walk to the Metro station and minutes from nice bars and restaurants in the Latin Quarter and The Village  We really enjoyed our stay at the Chateau LArgoat and would stay here again if we returned to Montreal  
P => Good value We stayed at Chateau de lArgoat for  nights during a recent vacation in Montreal  Our room was quite basic and a little run down but very clean and everything in working order  We found the staff to be uniformly pleasant and helpful and enjoyed the convenient location   its very close to the bus station where the airporter drops you is about half a block from a metro station and within easy walking distance to nice shops and restaurants on St  Denis and St  Laurent  We also appreciated the internet access and coffeejuicepastry in the morning  Overall a perfectly pleasant place to stay for the price  
P => Wouldnt stay anywhere else Ive stayed there every year for my  day vacation in e for a ade or more I love it Now has free internet terminal in the lobby  
P => quite comfotable for the price the hotel offers a high level of convenience  it is located just   minutes walk from the Sherbrooke metro station  the quotfreequot parking behind the hotel saved me some bucks  the room was fairly ent and neatly kept even though it looked much better on the hotels web site beware dont expect too much after watching the pictures on the web  i liked the jagguzi worth paying extra for it i highly recommend this hotel for business travelers and budget tourists especially if you are driving  if you want something really romantic you should consider somewhere else and pay more  for us the hotel was more than good enough  
P => Friendly simple and comfortable The hotel is a good cross between a BampB and a hotel  I stayed in room  which is one of the more basic rooms ideal for one person or a couple on a budget  The room was very comfortable with a solid matress brightly painted walls and interesting artwork  A mirrored closet and chest of drawers provided ample space for clothes and a place to hide cases etc The room has a seating area with coffee table and lamp for reading a writing desk with phone free local calls and free Wi Fi internet access and a good size TV with cable  This room also came with remote controlled air conditioning The bathroom was rather small half bath but very clean and fresh   more than adequate for a short stay  There is housekeeping daily The small but well kept breakfast room is orated with posters from past Montreal events  The breakfast is continental with the usual croissants pain au chocolat bagels etc  Tea and coffee is available along with juices and herbal teas there is also an all day coffee machine  The waitress was always extremely friendly and helpful and the service was fantastic  There is a lounge next door to the breakfast room where you can read a paper or use the hotels computer if you have no laptop Everyone from the people on the front desk to the housekeeping staff were always very friendly and polite and keen to make you feel at home  When I asked about local coffee shops the kind woman at reception took me onto the street just outside and gave me plenty of helpful suggestions  The hotel lobby also has plenty of free leaflets and guides to local restaurants events and attractions Whilst some of the oration is a little quaint brass beds I really cannot fault this hotel for the service and value for money  At just  a night I had a clean comfortable hotel with great features such as free internet and only a  minute walk to the Sherbrooke metro station  Indeed it is only a short stroll to the main shopping parade of rue St Catherine Highly recommended  
P => lovely boutique hotel Comfortable room actually two bedrooms in a small hotel  Front desk staff were pleasant welcoming and helpful  Nice breakfast  Rooms and bathroom spotlessly clean  Close to local restaurants and small cafes and to a Metro station  Comfortable quiet reasonably priced for Montreal  
P => Great welcome Great location Great Price We were a party of  adults and had  rooms in the hotel  Each room was individual and the website description was extremely accurate  We stayed during the Outgames so night time was very noisey however the hotel was not to blame for this  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times prior to and during our stay  My wife and I stayed in a room at the front of the hotel and there was some street noise at nght so if this bothers you try for a room at the back  The location was excellent right on the edge of the Latin quarter and close to the Metro  Rooms were very clean and the maid service was impeccable breakfast was a little sparse but at the end of the day you get this included in the cost rather than as an additional cost  Please note this hotel is not really suited for disabled or elderlyinfirm people as there are a few steps up to the main door and no lift in the hotel  All in all for price location and welcome I thoroughly recommend this hotel  I will definately use this hotel if I return to Montreal 
P => Great little hotel My girlfriend and I stayed in medium room   with a standard bathroom small but everything we needed  We had no issues speaking English with the staff  From the moment we arrived the staff were very helpful with our every need  Check in was quick and smooth  The common areas of the hotel looked quite clean and modern  Unfortunetly there is no elevator in the building but with only  floors you need to be quite lazy to reject this hotel because of that  Our room was always clean new towels were swapped with our wet dirty ones daily and the bed always got made  On top of all that you get free wireless Internet free breakfast not much offered mind you  but enough to keep us happy and free parking  The parking lot is small with cars often triple parked but the staff had no issues when we wanted to get our car out of the lot during our stay  Also the Sherbrooke metro station is right across the street  And Rue St  Denis is only a block away  My only complaint would be the room did have a hint of smoky smell  Surely they spray it down with some kind of air freshener before new guests arrive  However it didnt bother us and were non smokers  If were ever in Montreal again Im sure that this will be where we stay  
P => Happy with the Largoat I spent many hours of agony pouring over reviews on this site to determine where I would spend seven days and six nights in Montreal  I would be staying alone and needed a place that was affordable safe convenient and comfortable I was very pleased with my ision to stay at the Chateau de Largoat  The place isnt perfect but it was nearly perfect for my needs I was in room  double bed  per night  Room  has a sink called a lavabo an end table a desk a dresser  mirrors a chair racks to hang clothes and a suitcase table  It also boasts large windows pretty details on the walls nice colors spotless carpet TV phone and radio  I made ample use of the wifi as well When I first got into the room I was happy with how it looked   but there were a couple problems  First the room was a bit warm and the air was stuffy  The air conditioner cannot be controlled from within the room    I went to the desk and asked them to turn it down and it was cool enough for the duration of my stay The second problem is that the bed was far from luxurious  Its large    but it was very uncomfortable at first  Someone else on the site said that the bed was like sleeping on a floor   that was my first impression but after my first exhausted nap on the bed it became progressively comfortable and I adjusted my expectations  I was worried it would be a problem since I was staying six nights but it honestly was not  I slept fine The room lacked an interior bathroom but I knew that ahead of time  I was choosing between this and an even smaller room that was advertised for  a night    its not on the website but management told me about it    that room has a bed thats slightly larger than a single and a bathroom but I thought it would be too small for me so I went with room  My bathroom was in the hall two doors from my room  I was worried that this would be very inconvenient but it wasnt  Id rather have a relatively spacious room and a bathroom down the hall than a tiny room with a bathroom inside  The salle de bain was in fact spotless and charming  It was a nice size as well  I didnt realize that one of the mirrors in the bathroom doubles as an armoire and holds some toiletries until a few days into my stay  It took me a while to figure out the locking mechanism though  If you stay in this room I just suggest you plan accordingly    bring flip flops and a conservative robe andor something else to wear in between the room and the bathroom  Room  is located just a few steps away from the front desk so I always felt safe going back and forth between my bedroom and the bathroom Other points  The breakfast service was adequate for me   nothing special but enough to get you going  There is a small cafe area where you can get coffee in the morning and put in an order for pastries  This is included in your room rate  There was a young woman there during my stay who handled the breakfast orders   she was incredibly nice  At first I was concerned about not having room service but in fact I discovered that not only can you take your food to your room but you can call the front desk and put in an order  I dont know if they always do this but every time I called they sent me my food and coffee   There are no fridges in the room but you can use theirs  When the soda machine ran out of water on two different occassions the managers were kind enough to pour me an ice cold glass of brita water   They offer laundry service next day in my case and have handy items at the front desk for purchase ie toothbrushes and for free umbrellas  I got good recommendations from the front desk staff on two different occassions    first i wanted to know if there was anywhere nearby I could excercise  they recommended a park thats a few blocks away   i was concerned that it wouldnt be safe but i went jogging there during the afternoon and early evening on a few occassions and it was gorgeous and full of families and couples  Another staff member also recommended a great place to eat   Le Cherrier on La Rue St  Denis   The hotel is well located for several reasons  First if you need a cab its directly across the street from Le Plaza Doubletree and there are always taxis there  Secondly its also directly across the street from the Sherbrooke metro stop so it literally takes just a few minutes to get into the heart of the city  Third there are restaurants pharmacies and depanneurs convenience stores all within reach Overall I enjoyed my stay at Chateau de Largoat and I highly recommend it for anyone on a budget   but next time I come to Montreal I think Ill stay in one of the more expensive   but well appointed   boutique hotels in the old city  
P => Great hotel We stayed for  nights Room  medium room small bathroom  The room was a good size and the bathroom was small but met our needs  This hotel has some of the most friendly staff we have come across especially the room maid and the breakfast waitress  All booking communications were done by eamil and the manager was very helpful and described the rooms acccurately  We also had to change the dates of our stay several times   all this was dealt with professionally  The hotel is located well the metro making access in the city easy buy a week pass Mon Sun for   rather than the tourist  day pass for   If we come to Montreal again we will stay here again   at  it was great value  
P => A Fabulous Little Hotel My mother and I stayed in room  for three nights in y  It is actually two adjoining rooms with a door that closes between them  There is a full sized bed in one room and a twin bed in the other each room has its own TV and air conditioner operated with a remote control  The bathroom was huge with a bathtub so long I could completely stretch out and be totally underwater from head to toe Im quot  The room and bathroom were extremely clean and was always fully stocked with towels soaps etc  The lavender soap was so great I brought a bar home with me It was painted in cheerful yellow and light green and I enjoyed that some of the original woodwork had been retained  Based on what I had read in other reviews here I asked for a nonsmoking room in the rear of the building and on an upper floor  All of these requirements were met    our room was actually at the end of the hall on the second floor so we never had anyone walking past our door  A few times I could hear voices either from the hall or the adjoining room but never as much as a loud TV or footsteps overhead  We heard absolutely no noise from outside the building The staff was always extremely friendly both in my e mail communications to reserve the room and in person at the hotel  Everyone I encountered spoke good English  The breakfast options were basic nothing home cooked    store bought pastries etc  but Im not a big breakfast eater and a bagel was enough to satisfy me  The coffee was good and plentiful  They also had some samples of a new brand of muffin set out for guests to try and offer opinions  I didnt drive my car at all during my stay and it was completely safe parked behind the building for three nights  I used the computer in the lounge to check my e mail every evening and only once had to wait less than a few minutes to use it  All the guests I encountered were friendly and seemed to be satisfied with their choice of lodging The Chateau dArgoat is a great option for those who want the personalized atmosphere of a bed and breakfast but who want some of the benefits such as your own bathroom and a little more privacy of a hotel  As other reviewers have said the location is great and it is a lot cheaper than the chain hotels on this part of Sherbrooke  It is in an older building and if youre looking for an upscale boutique hotel or a Sheraton type place this isnt it but it is very well maintained with both original details and modern updates  
P => Charming Friendly and Convenient We stayed for four nights in room   Our accommodations were well kept and perfect for a family with two children  The staff was always very gracious and helpful in terms of dining recommendations sightseeing tips and general quotgetting around townquot ideas  The location was ideal   right across the street from a Metro station within  stops of Old Montreal and other attractions   with fine dining options within a few minutes walk  Our room was very quiet especially considering that we were right on Rue Sherbrooke  The continental breakfast was very enjoyable as well  If you are looking for the usual pre packaged hotel stay or luxury accomodations that cater to your every whim go elsewhere  But if you are looking for a charming unique experience with a friendly staff that knows the city and not just the tourist traps this is the place for you  We would definitely repeat our experience  
P => Stay Away From This Hotel My mom and I chose this hotel for our Montreal vacation based on all the fabulous reviews on this website  What a terrible mistake that was  This hotel could not have been more dissapointing  The room was disgusting    the carpet looked like it hadnt been cleaned in over  years and I was literally grossed out when my bare foot accidentally touched the floor  I had to wash my hair in the sink the first morning because the shower head was so old that water was hardly coming out of it  They did replace the shower head once I complained but the water pressure was non existant and so I had to continue washing my hair in the sink the rest of my stay  There were two double beds in the room but one of them was completely un usable  The matress was so hard that my mom and I actually checked to make sure we werent sleeping on the box spring  If the floor hadnt been so disgusting I think I would have slept on the floor  Instead my mom and I had to share a bed every night  Im not sure where the pictures on their website came from but they are CLEARLY not of the hotel in its current condition  It looks like it hasnt been reated or even updated in  years  Additionally on our first day there we asked the man at the reception desk for recommendations for a good place to have lunch  He sent us on a  minute walk through a dangerous looking park into a street filled with tourist trap restaurants where I would never be cht dead eating  We discovered by ourselves the next day theres an entire street filled with great restaurants and cafes just down the block  It was the last time we asked anyone at the hotel for recommendations  Honestly Ive been traveling all my life and have never stayed in such a bad hotel  And Im not the only one who feels this way  While we were waiting for a cab to the airport on our last day we saw  different couples complain about their room and leave to start looking for another hotel This place doesnt deserve the  stars it has  Please if you want to have a nice stay in Montreal DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL  I promise you    youll be sorry  
P => Perfect European style hotel I stayed ten nights at the Chateau de lArgoat in   The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful  This includes the front desk the cleaning staff and the people who serve breakfast  My room and bathroom were very spacious and impeccably clean  Although located on a main street the rooms facing the back are quiet  Continental breakfast is nicely served  The location is great two minutes from Metro Sherbrooke short walk to the trendy restaurants of the Plateau St Denis Duluth St Laurent etc  and close to the Old Town and port  The beautiful Parc La Fontaine is two minutes away and is great for jogging or a stroll  The weather was miserable at the beginning of my stay and I enjoyed returning early afternoon to escape the rain and cold for a few hours  The staff offered a lovely pot of tea on a tray that I could take to my room  There is a quotDepanneurquot nearby where you can buy makings for a meal and with the cold temperatures and heavy rain this was a welcome option some evenings  You can use the microwave and store food in the refrigerator  At Can  it is a great deal  The hotel offers free parking you have to leave the car keys as the vehicles are double parked but a member of the staff is permanently present night and day  The front desk staff made arrangements for a good deal on a rental car and saved me   This was my second stay at the Chateau de lArgoat and I will definitely return again next time  
P => Wonderful Hotel I stayed here with friend a in late il  I was a little worried about the location all for nothing  It has a GREAT location  You can walk less than  minutes to the Rue Sherbrooke metro stop which is more or less across the street  If you dont want to bother with transferring underground trains you can walk a few more minutes   downhill   to the bus station where there is also a metro stop Berri UQAM  This is a transfer station  You are also only a couple of minutes walk to Rue St  Dennis where there are tons of restaurants and shops  There is free parking behind the hotel and a free breakfast  No quothot foodsquot but delicious muffins croissants bagels toast juice coffee and tea  You can have a much as you would like   you just have to ask  There is a common room with a small tv and internet access  We never had a problem getting onto the computer   be had to wait  minutes one time  The breakfast area is small  The first morning I had to wait  minutes for a table  No big deal  Breakfast is served from  am until  noon I believe  There seems to be a bit of a rush at  but if you arrive later you will have no problem  I also saw some people taking the food back to their room We had a room facing the front right across from the front desk and while there was some noise nothing that I couldnt get over  The room had a nd door that you could close in addition to the one that went into the lobby area so that helped buffer indoor noise The staff was very friendly and helpful  When we checked in the person on duty told me the hair dryer in my room was broken but he would have another placed in the room  When we got back a couple of hours later it was there  While the towels were not large there were plenty of them  There were extra pillows in the closet  If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay and are using public transportation this it it I would not hesitate to stay here again 
P => Lovely stay My husband and I just got back from a weekend in Montreal and we stayed for two nights in the Chateau de lArgoat hotel  The hotel is quaint but not shabby  It reminded me of family run hotels in Europe  The staff were all very nice  Our room was clean and comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was terrific  I really enjoyed the breakfast which is free and brought out for you by a waitress  The coffee was great and the bagles muffins and pain au chocolate were outstanding  Getting a good breakfast helped us to save money on food The Chateau de lArgoat is in a great location   just at the edge of the Plateau so there are tons of cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance  There is a metro stop just across the street from the hotel if you prefer to go underground  
P => Cool French Vibed Hotel This is our third time in Montreal  The first two times we stayed in chain hotels near St  Catherine street  We prefer the Plateau area and thus this time ided to stay at a place more in the heart of things What a great pick  This reasonably priced hotel provides free parking WiFi and waitress served continental breakfast wbagels from the famous Fairmount bagel shop  The Metro stop is less than two small blocks away but most cool things in the Plateau and Latin Quarter are within easy walking distance Our nonsmoking room was in the back of the hotel nice n quiet and had a large bathroom and  TVs  Unlike previous complaints seen on this site our room had a hairdryer and had no odor of smoke  I did speak to a woman who had a NS room and did smell cig smoke through her vent however The breakfast room and common living room are orated in a French cafe style with posters of recent Quebecois movie and music releases adorning the walls  This place seems very dog friendly  We saw three including a seeing eye dog during our stay  Well be sure to come back to the Chateau 
P => Joie de vivre a Montreal My friend and I stayed at the Chateau over Labor Day weekend  It was my third time but the first in  years  I had stayed there as a poor college student in the least expensive room in  and  when it was called the Argoat Tourist Lodgebefore the Quebec government required French names  This time we stayed in Chambre  the grand suite  We had two large rooms arated by a  foot hallway  This meant that we didnt disturb each other if we snored or turned on the tv in the middle of the night  There was a tv in each room  Along the hallway were two rooms one with a toilet and a sink and another with a sink shower and   person jacuzzi  There was plenty of hot water for each usage of the hot tub  Everything was absolutely spotless  We stayed three nights and found the room cleaned with ample towels soap shampoo etc  each afternoon upon our return  The hotel had a large refrigerator for everyones use  Even though the sign said to label items I put a few bottles of beer in there and found them all there when I returned to retrieve the cold beers  A corkscrew and wine glasses were provided free of charge for our usage  The breakfast was absolutely fabulous  Croissants like in Paris Pains au chocalat and more  Canadians drink coffee like Americans and the coffee was great and always available  Orange juice and my special requests for a carafe deau avec des glacons carafe of ice water each morning was always granted  Common areas of hotel were maintained as in a  star hotel  The staff was fantastic  All of the guests appeared to be having a wonderful visit when I saw some during breakfast and passed by others in the hall and I never heard any loud noise more than a few car horns and fire trucks out on the street  No noise in the hotel at any time more than happy conversations  I am sorry that I had only returned to Montreal once in the past  years  I stayed in a different area of town that time in  but will return to the Chateau sometimes in the next  or  years  Location is perfect and near many things but away from the crowds  Rue Sherbrooke is a very safe bustling street with many condos and apartments  The Metro is across the street and a  minute walk  Easy walk or metro ride to McGill University the shopping areas Vieux Montreal Gay Montreal the casinos Mount Royal Mont Real in French from where the citys name came the Montreal Canadiens arena great restaurants etc  Montreal est formidableLe Chateau de lArgoat is full of the joie de vivre that Quebec is known for Bon voyage a tous Please visit the Chateau and enjoy Montreal  
P => The real Montreal experience In response to the person who wonders what uni lingual Americans fare at the quotArgoatquot I have been coming here for some time and I can say they fare just fine  The staff is friendly and will do anything to make your stay more pleasant  Its over on the Francophone side of Rue St Laurent so whether youre in the hallway or outside the place you immediately know youre in Montreal not Dallas or Cleveland  I dont know why someone is carping about the parking arrangements I park my car there in the back lot and take the subway everywhere  That way I dont get one of the citys famous parking tickets  The staff there warn you about possibility of theft but the managers window overlooks the lot Ive never had a speck of trouble  Its certainly worth the C a day that one would spend for parking at the chain luxury hotels   Its certainly a popular place  Its not surprising it is booked during jazz festival in y but I went there last  uary  with a bitter cold wind and it was full up with a number of U S  plates in the lot  
P => Disappointing From looking at various websites I was under the impression that this was a three star hotel  Unfortunately this place is much more of a bed and breakfast and not a very good one at that The common areas are run down and there is no elevator  I had a non smoking room but it reeked of smoke The whirlpool was old and disgusting looking there was no hot water coming from the shower even when there was hot water available from the whirlpools tap  The towels were old thin and small and the breakfast was a joke  A sheet of paper in each room explains that its the hotels policy not to offer the usual extras room service hair dryers etc in order to keep prices low  However prices are not that low   they fall within the norm of what similar establishments offer  The staff was relatively friendly and there were plenty of tourist materials at the front desk  However dont be fooled by their snazzy website   the best thing about this place is the free parking 
P => Clean room easy on your pocket If you are looking for a fancy room with above average atmosphere that can WOW most people and are planning to stay in your room a lot   hours per day try other more expensive hotel Stay here for  nights during the week of t   If you are looking for a clean room to sleep and shower that is easy on your pocket ok atmosphere this will meet your needs  Hotel has very good location a block walk from Sherbrooke Metro Station  Very short walk south to the Latin Quarter and north to St Denis restaurants and shops  Hotel also has free local calls AC cable TV free continental breakfast and very slow but free Internet access in the hotels sitting room BTW The Airport Shuttle folks told me wrong information  After you get off the airport shuttle in downtown the minibus offered as part of the airport shuttle service will NOT transport you to this hotel  Minibus driver told me it was outside of his boundary  Stay on the airport shuttle that makes the final stop at the Montreal Bus Central Station  long blocks from the hotel    of the block is uphill  You can walk or take a cab to the hotel  
P => Had a great stay hope to return one day My wife and I stayed here on t  th to the th  Great location  not in the heavily touristed areas but close to everything  Halfway between Vieux Montreal and the Plateau area  The Metro  safe clean and reliable  is a block away  Very charming place with a very nice room which had a brass bed a very large bathroom and cheery yellow walls  Everything was spotlessThe first night in it was pouring rain so we went around the corner to St  Denis and had a very casual and enjoyable dinner at quotCreperie Bretonquot  Met a fellow guest at breakfast great bagels and croissants by the way who agreed the front rooms were a bit noisy we had a back room with a slight view of downtown and it was great Downsides the towels were small and a little thin the toilet paper likewise  Sorry    And no elevator  But really very small complaints in an otherwise excellent affordable friendly charming convenient place  Hope to return again one day One last thing if you are in Montreal on a Saturday take the Metro up to the Jean Talon stop and check out the fantastic outdoor ket nearby the che du Nord  
P => Great place very friendly staff I too completely agree with the previous posters on how nice this hotel is  Its location is perfect the latin quarter and rue St  Denis is within  minutes walking distance The room was very clean I must say spotless The staff was very friendly and gave us many tips on how to spend our days and where to go out to eat Dont forget to check out La Popessa restaurant on St  Denis  very neat concept  Its italian and they serve all kinds of pasta  You choose your pasta type and sauce and they make your food right in front of you I would definately stay at this hotel again 
P => Looooved Chateau de Largoat The reviews are true I stayed here with my boyfriend for  nights and it was just perfect We got the  blue  room on the rd floor with  queen beds with a bathroom with a big whirlpool for  CAN because it was their only room free under such short notice  They keep the rooms so clean  probably the cleanest bathroom I have ever stayed in  The whirlpool was a huge plus  so relaxing And even the little breakfast in the morning although probaby not enough for the biggest eaters is a good quaint little snack before a big late lunch at some of the cutest restaurants nearby  Very convenient is the currency exchange literally a  minute walk way  The metro is also very close but you neednt go too far for some fantastic dining venues  The only complaint is that the TV is nothing fancy and the chairs in our room were kindve old but if youre in Montreal you wont be doing much of sitting around in your hotel anyway  I loved my stay here  and honestly were excited to return there and to check out some of the even larger rooms For the price you pay  its a perfect choice  Note No elevators  so if youve got a lot of luggage be prepared to lug it up the stairs  
P => Great Place I cant agree more with the previous posters the Chateau de LArgoat is a great place Nice and clean rooms the rooms facing the street can be a bit noisy so book a room at the back if youre easily disturbed by traffic friendly staff ent prices etc  Would definitely stay here again 
P => great place to stay Great hotel we stayed in the smaller room but it was very comfy clean cheap and convenient  staff was very helpful  also there is a cute breakfast room with free coffee and a small breakfast  very close to rue st  denis and a block away from the metro   
P => Excellent time After reading the reviews posted I ided to give this place a try It did not disappoint  We got a large room with a nice hot tub  The place was very clean and the hotel personnel were so friendly I loved the location too    very close to St  Denis and the BYOW restaurants  
P => Small room but a lot of charm We stayed here for  nights in   We requested the least expensive room students    and got the smallest one in the hotel for night  The room and bathroom were indeed very small only big enough for a double bed but we had a private balcony facing the street  The parking was free and in the back of the hotel car keys had to be left with the desk since all cars were double parked  The complimentary continental breakfast was great and quotall you can eatquot  The hostess proprietor was very friendly  The hotel was close to  metro stations and within walking distance to St Denis and Ste Catherine  
P => A wonderful place to stay We have stayed here a few times  The price and location are very pleasing and the staff could not be nicer The room and baths are very clean and the included continental breakfast is a nice extra  
P => You should try Chateau de LArgoat My wife and I just returned from a  night stay in Montreal  Not being sure of where to stay  Montreal has so many hotels to choose from  we tried the Hotel Chateau de LArgoat on Sherbrooke Street Est  It deserves mention on your website it is one of the cleanest hotels weve stayed in friendliness of the staff is above average and its location directly across the street from the Sherbrooke Metro station make it a great place to stay It has many different unique amp large rooms including hot tubs and  poster beds and a quaint breakfast nook We cant wait to return there 
P => The reviews are true

P => nothing but good things to say about this place Upon walking in we were warmly welcomed by the staff  She offered us several helpful maps and sightseeing options and mentioned that admission to the Architecture museum was free with our keycards  Other staff members were just as helpful   one recommended and called in our reservation for a terrific French bistro a block away The room itself was quite comfortable and very clean  Fresh towels were placed in the bathroom daily and though the bathroom itself wasnt enormous it was still large enough for two people to get ready for the day  Bed was comfortable sheets were clean and the pillows were soft Breakfast was included with our stay and consisted of a sensible spread of croissants cereal hard boiled eggs fruit salad cheese and cold meats salami ham  Seating available in the boudoir as well as the lobby and area near the stairs The location itself is fantastic   its not on the busiest of streets but only a few blocks away from Rue St  Catherine and the Guy Concordia Metro station the entrance on St  Mathieu is closest  For those that like exercise there is a Bixi station half a block away on Sherbrooke St Highly recommended  Will definitely return here for our next visit  
P => top notch staff and breakfast buffet This place was lovely and the amenities were great  The breakfast buffet was wonderful   kinds of quiche eggs yogurt croissants toast fresh fruit and more  Delish The staff was bilingual and quite happy to help with directions restaurant suggestions reservations etc  Just generally pleasant folks all round  We were near the breakfast room and had our fire alarm go off because of the toast  making in the morning so they kindly moved us to a nicer room for the rest of our stay  Cushy bathrobes super nice sheets great water pressure even upstairs and plenty of hot water for two showers  Free internet access a plus  Located in the museum district about two short blocks from the Metro which gave us access to lots us sightseeing shopping dining  Only caveat would be the stairs  if you were not able to get around well it might be a problem however Im sure they would do whatever they could to help  Overall one of the nicest places Ive ever stayed  
P => Wonderful stay We had read the reviews of Chateau Versailles and thought we knew what to expect  We did upgrade our room upon arrival and even then we thought it was a value  The staff was very helpful and we called upon the front desk and concierge daily with quottouristyquot questions  They were always helpful and patient with us and in one instance saved us a lot of money on tickets to a festival with some quothome town localquot information The rooms were clean the breakfast buffett was flavorful and filling and the location was close to the metro and many good resturants  I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would like to return again myself  
P => Glad we chose the Chateau We spent three nights at the Chateau during tember  Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a luxury hotel with all the amenities then dont stay here and end up giving it a one star rating because it was not up to your requirements  But if you are looking for a somewhat unique place and can tolerate a few inconveniences such as no elevator then this is an option you should consider We were very satisfied with our stay  We had a nice room on the third floor a room that was not in the cookie cutter category of most hotels  The bathroom was a bit small but must be considered within the structure of the building  I would also comment that the carpet appeared somewhat worn  Other than that we had all we needed I had no problems with the front desk staff  I did not find them to be aloof or snooty as some others have commented  In fact when we checked in they actually advised us of the  parking down the street as an option to their own  a night fee  Our check in and check out both went smoothly and the bellman was on the spot to handle our luggage and take care of our vehicle With respect to our vehicle once we checked in we left it unused for the duration of our stay  The subway stop is a short  blocks from the hotel and in fact you can catch a bus right outside the hotel which will take you the  blocks down to the subway station  Once you get to the subway so much of the city instantly becomes accessible to you Previously the Chateau charged for wireless internet  Happily they have recently changed that policy and it is now free  Also included in the room price is a breakfast offering a nice selection of foods and set up in a lovely relaxing room In short we were happy with our choice and look forward to staying there again  
P => Cant understand the negative reviews Just spent the weekend at Chateau Versailles t   to    Even though we had one of the small quotcheaperquot rooms on the first floor it was lovely Cute clean funkily orated good quaility towels and toiletries The staff were very friendly and helpful we were charged accordingly and enjoyed the free breakfast provided  If you are looking for the cookie cutter nature of a large hotel this hotel is NOT for you  However if you like art antiques and good service enjoy the Chateau VersaillesKarla and GrantHamilton and Toronto Ontario Canada 
P => Great boutique hotel We loved it We stayed at Chateau Versailles for three nights in early tember having booked the hotel back in ch  I checked reviews of the hotel when we booked it and it sounded great  Just before we left on our trip I checked the reviews again and became concerned due to some negative reviews  Our experience wasnt perfect but we would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat We arrived by car around pm on tember nd and it was a pretty warm day  We were initially assigned room    The room was warm so we cranked up the AC only to find the room temperature didnt change  We called reception and they sent an engineer who told us we didnt have control over our room temperature    it was controlled by other rooms  We didnt quite understand that but were offered a different room which we accepted  The room was a bit smaller but the AC worked  Our room was on the second floor facing the street  Noise was not a problem  There is no elevator in the hotel  Our room had a nice ble bathroom comfortable queen bed soothing or  If you drive to Montreal there are two options for parking a car valet parking at Le Meridien across the street for day or public outdoor parking just down the street for day  We chose the latter and left our car there for  nights The breakfast buffet is exceptional quiche hard boiled eggs croissants pain au chocolat ham cheeses breads juices cereals coffee and tea If there was one thing we werent thilled with it was some of the front desk staff in the afternoonsevenings  Our first day there were two young women Sara was one of them who were great and very helpful  The other two afternoons there were also young women at the front desk  They seemed preoccupied with things other than helping us and didnt know a thing about local restaurants  Yvonne was at the front desk each morning  She is knowledgeable and helpful Only  blocks from the metro we liked the location of Chateau Versailles because its n not in the middle of a touist area Free Wi Fi that worked perfectly If you want large rooms a concierge at your servive at all times an elevator and everything as perfect as possible you probably dont want a boutique hotel so dont stay here  If you enjoy boutique hotels I highly recommend Chateau Versailles  
P => We loved this place  This place was recommended by a friend who always stays there whenever she visits her in laws in Montreal  It is the perfect combination of a cozy inn with the clean feeling of a proper hotel  It consists of two buildings that are attached and you have to go on a bit of a labyrinthine journey to get from one building to another but thats part of its charm  I dont believe there are elevators  The rooms are a tad small but it is a major city after all and for the price it was fine for us  The bathrooms were extremely clean there was WiFi although the access was spotty though I dont know if thats the hotels fault valet parking for a fee and a delicious breakfast buffet with plenty of croissants quiche fruit etc  Its minutes away from Mont Royal and the subway is  blocks away so its easy to access the rest of the city  We liked that it wasnt amid the hordes of tourists so we didnt mind having to do a mini commute to get to the tourist spots  The person at reception was a little aloof but as much as any reception at a hotel would be  We didnt mind it too much because we liked the anonymity of being in a hotel  Highly recommended 
P => Fantastic Little Hotel in Beautiful Montreal Near McGill University My wife and I just returned from one week at the Chateau Versailles in Montreal  We went to Montreal for the first time to sightsee and attend the Rogers Cup Tennis Tournament  The Chateau Versailles turned out to be the perfect choice for us  The positives Close to subway Nice breakfast in the morning which was included in the room price Incredibly courteous and helpful staff members including Yvonne Issam and Fernanda at the front desk a small quaint hotel we were glad we didnt stay in a high rise hotel free internet access from the community computer which was usually open when I needed it  Negatives If you dont like stairs this isnt the right hotel for you Paying a low price like we did probably means youll get a small room with a tiny bathroom  If you cant handle that dont book a low priced room  Because of a small water leak in our small room we were kindly moved to a larger room facing Sherbrooke Street  The room was fantastic very roomy and classy  While the noise wasnt a big problem the management should invest in triple pane windows for the front of the hotel which would cut down on street noise considerably and save on energy costs  All in all we had a great stay and can highly recommend this hotel  
P => Stay somwhere else stayed here for  nights and was very disappointed ffrom the start  Right on busy main road and our room was very small and very noisy  Booked superior room so would not have like to see standard room Room VERY dark with dark coloured walls and bedcovers  A lick of cream paint and new bedcovers would work wonders  Complained and asked for room move which was accommodated  nd room better but still dark and not very inviting  Very old building with lots of stairs and no elevator so with lots of luggage and no porter a real nuisance  Breakfast was good and served in nice room however not a lot of space and on our last morning we were informed that an early breakfast am would not be possible  Location is OK close to Museum of Fine Arts and some barsrestaurants and metro  However during our stay we found much nicer locations Old Town Plateau and would recommend staying somewhere else  
P =>  Tired  Boutique Hotel I have travelled to Montreal for business   times a year over the last  years  Having stayed at other hotels in the past I was looking forward to staying at the Chateau Versailles for its quotboutiquequot atmosphere  Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was disappointed overall Although charming in appearance at first glance after taking a closer look I would say the hotel overall looks quottiredquot and could use a bit of a facelift  I was travelling with a sizeable group from my company and more than a few of us asked to be transferred over to the Meridien hotel across the street after the first night   a request which was fulfilled by the hotel staff My main reasons for moving were as follows My room was small and dark  I had requested a king sized bed ended up getting a double  The bed was very uncomfortable with a very very firm mattress that tended to quotpop upquot on the opposite end when you sat down on the corner of it  The bed cover was old and worn and looked dirty  The sheets blanket and pillows were all reminiscent of a cheaper motel and not a boutique hotel  There was no full length mirror and the quotarmoirequot in the corner was creaky cheap looking and had a door that wouldnt close By contrast the bathroom was more or less ok  The shower head and drain were very old and loose but the rest of the bathroom looked completely new  My main issue with the bathroom was that there was almost no counter space to put any of my things on  A little shelf would have been nice Since the building is old there is some noise expected  The floors are creaky and you could hear everyone walking on the floor above The common areas of the hotel are quaint and the breakfast room was lovely with a very nice continental breakfast served  I didnt have much interaction with the staff other than when I asked to be moved  They were friendly and efficient in accomplishing that  Interestingly though they didnt ask me why I wanted to move  I would have thought that the hotel would want to know why someone asks to be moved  day into their  night stay The rate my company paid was  per night and I would definitely not come back again at this rate  I believe it is very poor value for that price  If you can get a rate closer to  per night I would say youre getting what you paid for I will not be staying here again in future  For the same rate you can get a very comfortable bed at the Meridien across the street or the Delta on Avenue President Kennedy  The sheets feel newer there is a duvet on the bed and the rooms are a bit bigger with a desk to work at if you need to  
P => Jadore le Chateau  Dont hesitate to stay here  I spent  nights here last weekend and was quite happy  The front desk staff was very kind and efficient the free breakfast was a nice touch if not a bit repetitive and the location was great in my opinion  I unfortunately got stuck with one of the quotstreet levelquot i e  basement rooms which faced the small unkept courtyard so it was quite dark in the room even with all the lights and lamps switched on but I dont go to Montreal to spend time in the hotel so it wasnt a big deal  The only really negative thing I experienced was the constant sound of other guests walking in the rooms above me as well those inconsiderate people who felt it was OK to speak very loudly in the hallway and continuously slam their door at AM  I didnt get much sleep at all and it would be nice if the hotel could improve the sound proofing somehow or at least do something about the doors so they close more quietly Parking tip if youre going to be using your car during the day consider skipping the valet  I found plenty of metered parking around the hotel which is free in the evenings and overnight  Just be sure to read the signs and move the car or feed the machine by AM PM on Sundays  
P => Excellent location friendly service charming ample room  This hotel belongs to the more modern Meridien across the street but has the charm of being an old house  My room had a fireplace and was quite large  The breakfast is more than ent  
P => What a gem This is a true Montreal hotel  It is small so a boutiqe hotel but everything is personalized  I really loved it everything from its location its on Sherbrooke street in downtown to its very personalized customer service  Leave aside Montreal I dont think Ive stayed in a nicer hotel period  
P => Excellent Hotel   Special Rate Available This is a great hotel in the center of downtown  It is the true definition of a boutique hotel  I do have special rates still available for that hotel  If interested check the listing on the Montreal Craigslist or Kijiji 
P => Outstanding Hotel We recently stayed at the Chateau Versailles while vising Montreal  The location was perfect in tertms of being near the high end shopping museums restaurants  The staff was very pleasant and helpful  The accomodations were very nicely appointed and well kept  The breakfast was delicious and full of variety I would definately recommend this charming hotel to anyone vising Montreal 
P => Great Hotel We stayed at this hotel mid tember  and really enjoyed our experience  Our room was on the first floor and was very spacious  We arrived early and the host happily stored our luggage in a locked room until we could check in  The receptionists were a great help in giving us suggestions on where to explore and to eat  The hotel is in a great location to walk many places and close to a Metro station  It is just a couple blocks walk to Crescent St  where there are many restaurants and bars check for happy hour deals  The hotel had a ent sized breakfast spread each morning  There were only two downsides for us   when we got in our room it was very hot and the air seemed to not be working  We contacted the front desk and by that evening when we returned from dinner it was fixed and worked great the rest of our stay  The other downside is that they do not have free wireless internet  The do have a computer with internet you can use for free but sometimes you have to wait a while  Tip for internet use   Chateau Versailles and Le Meridian across the street are owned by the same company and there are two computers with internet for guest use on the second floor of Le Meridian  All in all we loved our stay cleanliness service and value were great  We would definitely stay at Chateau Versailles again 
P => Loved this hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for  nights in ember   The staff was super friendly and helpful and let us store our bags until we were able to check in we arrived early that morning from Toronto and they even let us check in early The rooms were small but very cozy with bright colours on the walls and cute or  Everything was super clean and tidy and there were lots of towels available  The only complaint which has nothing to do with the hotel was how COLD it was in Montreal in ember but we were expecting that anyway  We would stay at Chateau Versailles again for sure 
P => Great Hotel I stayed at Chateau Versailles for four nights in e  I booked through the website gtahotels com and got an amazing rate of only CAN per night with NO SINGLE SUPPLEMENT For an hotel of this standard this was simply amazing The staff were polite and helpful at all times The room was of a good size clean and modern in or  The bathroom was lovely Breakfast was included in my hotel rate and was very good and tasty   a good selection of cereals breads cheeses coldcuts and hot drinks and juice all available at the buffet I wanted to see as much of Montreal as I could and found this location to be ideal   it is a short stroll from the Guy Concordia Metro less than  mins and downtown is a CAN taxi ride I was very satisfied indeed with the hotel and with Montreal which is one of the best cities Ive visited   I love the mix of people the food is amazing the city is so diverse and interesting and theres LOADS to do 
P => Hidden Secret of Montreal   A  Star Gem  I arranged a stay for my wife her two sisters her mother and her two nephews  Unfortunately the reason for the travel was a funeral  The trip was very short notice and the city was completely booked up for the Grand Prix  I had to arrange everything from the States over the phone  The hotel staff went out of their way to accommodate my wifes family  To start they upgraded their room to a suite at the regular room rate  And by the time my wife and her family arrived everything was in place  They arranged baby sitting services for the children right in the hotel room  The arranged transportation services  The concierge service took care of every detail  My wife and her family did not so much as carry a piece of luggage once they arrived at the hotels doorstep  It was the best possible experience under such tragic circumstances  Each person they encountered greeted them with kindness a smile and left them with the impression that they were welcome guests in their  the hotel staffs  home  The experience was so much appreciated it will be the only hotel we stay in when visiting Montreal  
P => Disaster diverted   Just My girlfriend and I recently spent  nights at the Chateau Versailles in Montreal  To say we have a vast insight to the variety of rooms they offer would be an understatement  Upon checking into what we thought was a smoking room as requested at booking we were advised in no uncertain terms that the hotel does not have any smoking rooms and were therefore allocated a non smoking room  We reluctantly accepted and checked into what was a rather nice boutique style room  The room was pastel in colour of adequate size and with a funky art o style bathroom The next morning i spoke with the very polite and helpful receptionist and asked if in fact there were any smoking rooms   we were advised that yes there were and happily accepted a transfer  Quite why we were told there were no smoking rooms in the first place by the rather unhelpful girl on the front desk at check in is beyond me As you can expect we were now happy to indulge in our filfthy habit and settled into our new room as nice a standard as the previous oneUpon returning to our room after a day exploring Montreal we were shocked to discover that we could not open our doors  Upon consulation with firstly the front desk and then with the maintenance guys it turned out that the door lock had malfunctioned and we would therefore have to be relocated into the sister hotel Le Meridien across the street  After agreeing to do this the hotel then backtracked and advised we would still have to stay in the Chateau versailles and after a half hour delay we were found another room rd so far Although our new room was bigger it had a number of flaws  Firstly the room lacked any kind of daylight the bathroom was tiny and more importantly the room was as hot as hell  Unusually for this time of year Montreal happened to be really warm that weekend c and trying to sleep in this sweat box became unbearable so much so the next morning we complained to the front desk Luckily for us the nicer of the ladies on reception happened to be there and offered to find us yet another room  As you can imagine we were now becoming a little stressed out and frustrated with the sorry chain of events  To our delight however we were immediately offered a free upgrade to one of the hotels suites smoking also  This went some way to making up for all the problems we had had so far The suite itself was beautiful   massive in size with spacious living and bedrooms areas and topped off with a jacuzzi It was a bit of a shame as the hotel itself was really nice with on the whole good service nice rooms an ample free breakfast and a good location  If it wasnt for the chain of events i would be considering a   rating  On the other hand if it wasnt for the excellent customer service given by that one lady a rating of  or   have been awarded  As it happens we will compromise with a  Montreal however is a fantastic city full of warm friendly people and far nicer than dull Toronto  
P => Cozy weekend at the Chateau Versailles My girlfriend and I spent  nights at the Chateau Versailles  The cab from Gare Centrale Grand Central train station took around  minutes and cost under  The hotel is lovely and quaint  The check in and check out process was quick and simple  The hotel offers wifi at  per night  We were charged the wifi fee for both nights even though we only requested the first night  The problem was fixed without hassle You are not in quotdowntown downtownquot Montreal but we considered this an advantage as it arated us from the tourists and the noise the nightlife brings  We are avid walkers  its about  min to St  Catherines Street and about  minutes to St  Laurent Street  For those less inclined regular serviced bus routes are nearby as well as a Metro subway station Breakfast was wonderful  fresh croissants cereal deli meats cheeses juice and coffee  We stocked up for the train ride homeWe booked a Standard room and assigned a room on the third floor  While cozy the size of the room was fine  The bathroom is admittedly on the smaller size but its not unbearable for an average sized person We would recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway  The front desk staff was helpful polite and informative  We would stay again 
P => Boutique Hotel in out of the way location I noticed that other writers had differed on their opinion of this hotels location  I would say that it was the Hotels greatest drawback  I was making a return trip to Montreal after a brief visit in ust  The Chateau Versailles was mistakenly booked for me I had wanted the Meridien Versailles across the street  The Hotel is great if you are visitng the Sherbroke galleries or the museums  However for tourists wanting proximity to the metro the old city or the mont royal area this is toooooo out of the way  The hotel itself is located in two older buildings  It has a very small lobby with staff that seemed less than enthusiastic  I was in a really large room in what seemed like the basement  The windows looked out on the sidewalk The room seemed as if it was more for families  The breakfast was okay  There is also a nice bakery down the street for afternoon tea etc  and you can dine in the museums  There werent any restaurants nearby but a  minute walk to the St  Catherines shopping area yielded a lively restaurant scene  I wouldnt recommend this walk after dark for a woman alone  
P => Satisfied My husband and I stayed at Chateau Versailles over Labor Day weekend and enjoyed our stay  The front desk staff was very courteous and helpful  We were in a standard room on the th floor which was nice and quiet  Being a pregnant woman the climb up the stairs was a little challenging but not nearly impossible  The room was a bit small and the bathroom tiny but this only added to the coziness and charm of the hotel in our opinion  We didnt spend much time in there so it wasnt a real issue  Overall the hotel was very clean and well maintained the continental breakfast was wonderful and the location unbeatable  It was a  cab ride from the airport which is about  minutes away  We walked to just about every part of the city and felt safe the entire time We were in walking distance to museums shopping coffee shops restaurants etc  We would definitely stay here again when in Montreal  
P => Better than expected After reading some of the reviews for Chateau Versailles I was expecting a quotcosyquot i e  cramped room  However the price was right and it was well located so I thought Id give it a try  My boyfriend and I were booked into a quotStandardquot room for  nights  I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was plenty of space for the  of us and that the room was comfortable and very clean  We didnt have any problems with street noise and found the staff to be very friendly  The continental breakfast was tasty and even included quotcretonquot a French Canadian specialty As I said I chose the hotel for its location and the fact that it is within walking distance of the metro subway museums restaurants bars shopping etc  made it easy to enjoy Montreal  Minor drawbacks to the hotel   just two the size of the bathroom definitely smallish and the downstairs location of our room we had a window but not much natural light  These small details didnt put a damper on our trip though  We had a great time in Montreal and were glad that we stayed at the Chateau Versailles 
P => Comfortable great location classic not elegant Great location older hotel with older plumbing baths etc  But very clean and comfortable  Great location on Sherbrooke Avenue with museums galleries and great restaurant nearby  Sfaff very friendly and helpful  My room was small ideal for one person  After leaving an upscale boutique hotel this would be considered modest but one must consider that this is an older reated establishment  Breakfast room very nice and sufficient internet facilities  Clean and comfortable and not fancy I would return alone again but not to share with another person  The bathroom is too small  
P => Nice hotel good staff Stayed at the Chateau Versailles for  nights  I booked a quotDeluxequot room after I read the other reviews on this site that mentioned poor room placement and noise associated with the standard rate rooms  While our room was nice quotDeluxequot is a bit of an overstatement  The room was still small and the bathroom smaller I feel the only real benefit of booking a higher class room would be location  The staff was very pleasant and helpful reccomeded several good restaurants in the area  The breakfast was outstanding  breads fresh fruit cheese yogurt cold cereals etc  Very nicely done and well kept up  The hotels location is good the metro station was a very short walk away as were lots of great restaurants and shops  All in all I would return and reccomed to others 
P => Simply Wonderful We felt Chateau Versailles was a beautiful hotel for our Montreal get away  We were there for  nights Friday Tuesday  The staff is wonderfully polite and very helpful as well as being fluently bilingual  The only snag we had is that the front desk ran out of key cards so a porter showed us to our room where we waited for the bellman to bring our suitcases and the key cards up to us  Our room was comfortable and well orated with a nice view of the neighborhood  We were two flights up and had to climb stairs because there is no elevator but we didnt mind that  The location is excellent    we were within walking distance of the fine arts museum and a number of restaurants and shops and we were only three short blocks from a metro stop so it was easy to get to other places in the city as well  We heard a little noise from the street but not much  They also had a business center that allowed us to keep in touch with the rest of the world via e mail amp the web for free Breakfast is included and served in a very comfortable room where you have a choice of sitting at small tables or comfortable couches near the fireplace we were there in the summer so the fireplace wasnt in use but it was a really lovely setting  Breakfast was served buffet style and included a variety of breads butter jam cheese mixed fruit hard boiled eggs croissants chocolate croissants yogurt a variety of dry cereals milk juice and coffee  We definitely look forward to visiting Montreal again and staying at Chateau Versailles  We highly recommend it  
P => Very nice hotel in a great location I stayed in this hotel for  nights and I was very favorably impressed all around with the quality of this hotel  Chateau Versailles has a nice character to it it is small and cozy  There are only three floors and there must be around Im estimating  to  rooms altogether which gives it a personal touch  The room I stayed in was quite large and the furniture was elegant and in perfect condition  The bedsheets and towels were in great shape  The bathroom was a little on the small side but this is a minor issue  The hotel has a business center with two computers from which you can access the internet for free which was a nice plus  You can also get wireless internet in your room but you have to pay for that connection  Breakfast was good and it was included with the price of the room  Finally the location of the hotel was convenient its right in downtown Montreal  There are good restaurants and bars only a few blocks away and the nearest metro stop is about  meters from the hotel  
P => Loved the Chateau Just got back today after having a wonderful time in Montreal I booked this hotel on Travelocity and got excellent deal  I dont know how we got it but we paid far less than any other site I saw at the time or since then  It was a sweet deal  a night  So after reading the reviews I was positive wed get a room in the noisy first floor or worse in the basement But au contraire We arrived and were informed that we had been upgraded to a quotdeluxquot room with a king sized bed It was a very nicely sized room very quiet off the street  We really lucked out I could see how the st floor rooms or those on the street could be noisy  Which could really affect your stay  Our room was very comfortable well appointed and quaint  We really felt at home The breakfast in the boudoir was a nice touch  It was nice to not have to worry about that meal  Croissants nice fresh bread fruit cereal hard boiled eggs  Nothing fancy but a great start to the day Theres a sparse exercise room a bike treadmill and a cable type home gym    but who cares    youre on vacation right There are  computers you can use to surf and print things  You might have to wait to get on  The hotel is a converted house so theres not a very large lobby or front desk but it has most of what youd need The staff is wonderful bilingual and very helpful  Theres a full time AM PM consierge shehe works across the street at their other hotel Le Meridian  They helped us a lot making restaurant reservations and looking into tours  Housecleaning was good and transparent we never noticed them which I guess is good Location is great Its downtown but a block or two off the really busy part St  Catherine  The Metro stop is   blocks away  There is a lot to do with in walking distance  We walked a LOT  It was about Km to the Old Town or Chinatown  A few blocks to the main shopping area storefronts and underground malls  There are LOTS of food options touristy places Rue Cresent as well as CHEAP eats  Theres a college nearby Concordia University which means cheap food coffeshops and internet cafes  A few Metro stops from places like Plateau The Latin Quartier and Mile End that have nearly endless places to eat So bottomline look out for deals  Call ahead and book on the nd or rd floors  Bring comfortable shoes or buy a Metro pass  Or walk to help burn some of the s of calories youll indulge in some great food  
P => so charming we stayed here for  nights and loved it it was our first trip to montreal and so i did plenty of researching  we look for the authentic experience we we travel  this place was great  it felt very european  the room was on the small side but quite comfortable  its orated beautifully i love the colors and the view was of a viney green courtyard off the back of the building  quiet enough you are in a city after all  good breakfast delicious breads pastries ceral yogurt etc  the staff was very friendly and helpful the only reason we didnt give it an quotexcellentquot rating was the smoky smell upon entering our room  we quickly became accutomed to it and didnt notice it much a good restaurant close by is called the cafe europa  its across the street and down a half block located near some new constructuon  small locally owned with a wide variety of very reasonably priced european food  try the goulash or weiner schnitzelnot your cookie cutter hotel and thats why we loved it 
P => Ok but noisy We had booked and prepaid the hotel through Expedia  Although we had asked for a smoking room on check in there was only one room left and it was non smoking so we were forced to go outside to smoke and then go through a move the next day  This really put a bad start to the four days  We were moved the next day and the room was very nice but if you open the window there is considerable noise from the traffic  The included breakfact is simple cereal bread juice and coffee  Finding a seat can be difficult when the hotel is full  Be prepared to walk up stairs or try to get a room on the same floor as the desk or only one above  
P => Will always stay here I have stayed here on  occasions in the last  years  This hotel is perfect in location and services  The staff is old world and very helpful and friendlly  The breakfast that is included is perfect in quality and variety  I ask for a quiet room and quotwallaquot I am given a quiet room  Location is pefect if by foot or with car  The rooms are comfortable with yummy beds  Im picky and travel alot and this hotel has it all  Great comfort and service  
P => Great hotel for a weekend stay This hotel is great Our room was beautiful and the hotel staff was very friendly  My girlfriends and I stayed in the honeymoon suite so there was plenty of room for the  of us  It is very close to the metro shopping great restaurants and the Museum of Fine Arts  After spending the day in the freezing cold it was nice to have some place comfortable to come home to 
P => Dr  Jekyll  I was at this hotel twice in a week on the first and the last night of my business journey to Canada The first night I was really amazed I had a very large room with a relaxing bed to recover from jet lag and a large desk to work comfortably  Wow   I thought   this place is a real bargain and much nicer than expected The second night was very different  I spent the same amount of money but I was given a dark room in the basement so small that I could not keep my suitcase open and walk around the bed at the same time  Walking up and down to the basement on a steep narrow staircase with my luggage was not pleasent as well Rooms are clean and in good order  Staff is very polite and helpful  Continental breakfast is almost non existent Although the Chateau Versailles is overall a pleasant hotel I would probably make a different choice next time I am in Montreal  
P => Nice hotel central location good price Overall top ks for this small hotel in Montreal  The Hotel was conveniently located at just a short stroll from St Catherines street the main shopping artery in Montreal and just s stones drop from the subway station Rooms were well furnished and equipped with nice fluffy pillows and soft quality bedding tasteful well kept furnishings and they didnt miss all the extra touches such as coffee machine bath robes complimentary umbrellas quality Evelyn and Cabtree toiletries  as appossed as God knows what own brand possibly safeway savers  had I know I would have not carried mine all the way from England  The rooms were well heated ideal for those Montreal cold nights Breakfast was probably the weakest aspect of this hotel as the selection wasnt huge but what they had tasted delicious  Boiled eggs two types of bread sponge cake croissant pain au chocolat cheese cubes peanut butter jam chopped fruit most of it from the can orange juice fresh tea and coffee    that was about it   Also heres a tip if you book their superior rooms through their shopping package it works cheaper than booking a standard room and they rooms are much nicer The hotel staff was helpful although I wasnt impressed with their recommended guided tour company Grayline as they dumped me and a few other people on a site and left  
P => Nice enough but I could have done better Stayed in the Hotel Versailles on a two day trip to Montreal  I dont remember what I paid for it but I think had I done my homework I could have found a nicer hotel in a more exciting part of town First of all the parking situation at the hotel is terrible  Most urban hotels Ive been to feature underground or valet parking or have a relationship with a lot nearby where you can get a good discount  I pulled up to the front of the hotel which is on a pretty busy street and had to wave the bellhop out to have him tell me I was pretty much on my own for parking but they would valet park my car nearby for  a night  I guess thats not so bad but it seemed like a tough way to make a few bucks for a supposedly classy hotel Check in was fine a few different free newspapers available in the lobby were a nice touch  The room although nothing spectacular was clean and well orated  The bed and the furniture were comfortable  It was a cold day so I turned up the heat and it responded well  Unfortunately the hotel is downhill from a hospital and consequently there are many sirens The immediate area outside the hotel is OK but as I wasnt there for tourism I just walked around for awhile  There is a bank right across rue Sherbrooke with a secure ATM  As another reviewer said there is a boulangerie two blocks east of the hotel  Definitely try it out  It was my favorite experience of the time I was there  If you head south you come into a more commercial area with small shops and different restaurants  It was crowded Saturday night with a surprisingly diverse mix of young people  As I just found out thats because Montreals largest university is in the area So overall  not bad  But do your homework and make sure you are OK with a somewhat noisy location  
P => OVER RATED My husband and I recently took a couple of days off to celebrate our anniversary  I must have searched the internet for hours looking for that perfect place I wanted a romantic quiet establishement something special  All the review that I read on this hotel made me believe that it was that special romantic retreat  It was not  I booked the king room with a fireplace  First of all It is not a real fireplace but and electric light  very tacky   the TV did not face the bed the carpets were stained the drapes smelled and the bed spread was a very dark color and did not smell clean and the sheets must have been  count  If that was not bad enough the room was located within a very short distance about  to  ft of the front desk  If we could hear people whispering in the lobby We felt as if we had zero privacy  This place was terrible and expensive  If you are thinking of staying at this hotel keep searching you can do much better  
P => Wonderful place We had a wonderful stay there It has a good location quiet but close to many attractions including the Museum of Fine Arts  The staff was professional friendly helpful and informative  The rooms were beautiful  It was truly the cherry on top of my trip to Montreal I highly recommend it for couples  
P => Boutique Hotel   Four Visits   Definitely Above Average I have now stayed here  times over the past year    different rooms  excellent  fine and  OK a little tired with thin walls   located at the back of the building but still very OK Hotel location is great staff is friendly and helpful or is fine rooms are very clean TV and in room CDradio work  Latest room was very quiet  The continental breakfast is included in the rate subtantial with choices amp definitely above average for a continental breakfast My only beefs I couldnt turn the heating down   so room was a little on the warm side hey its ember and snowing outside the tea at breakfast left a lot to be desired   minimal in the big scheme of things I dont drink coffee but the bread containing orange peel was just excellent  The toilet wasnt flushing properly but was promptly fixed the next day with no hassle I have stayed in quite a few hotels on business and this one definitely rates a consistent above average so far  This hotel is definitely a quothidden gemquot and I almost never give full ks on principle  
P => Nice Boutique Hotel My husband and I stayed  nights in tember along with my parents  We were cautious because of the mixed reviews but we all ided it was a very pleasant stayThe bi lingual staff was great and the valet parking for our rental car was nice since there is limited parking in Montreal We had  deluxe rooms in the basement st floor in Quebec and they were both just lovely The or is chic and and bathrooms are really nice with great showers  Nice towels and Crabtree amp Evelyn bath products The rooms were extremely clean and they even offer a bed turndown  The beds were quite comfortable too which is a plus in a hotel The only downside was that the walls are a bit thin and you can hear walking above and talking to the sides but not too bad We had the breakfast buffet twice and it was simple but perfect if you are in a hurry and just want a quick bite  Great location to walk just about anywhere for dinner  Try Davinci Restaurant for an excellent Italian meal the owner Salvatore is just the greatest We took the Metro to Vieux Montreal and to Rue St  Denis where there is a great selection of cafes and bistros as well as shops  Mont Royal is not far from the hotel which is a lovely park and overlook of Montreal  If you have the means go to the Eastern Townships or Cantons dEst check out the Wine Route  Great little wineries or quotvignoblesquot in French  
P => Best Kept Secret in Montreal Not only was the room size more than adequate and the bathroom clean and abundantly stocked with fluffy towels and the beds firm with very high quality sheets      the staff was outstanding from the concierge that flagged down a cab without being asked to bell men who would get our car at a moments notice from the parking lot  Everyone was very helpful and eager to help us explore different parts of their wonderful city  Polite engaging helpful friendly       I could go on The location of this hotel is great  Just a couple of blocks  min from St Catherine St  and a few more to the Eaton Center  We will use this hotel again and I would recommend it  Not gaudy and posh    just very comfortable   in every way However the buffet breakfast was expensive and there are several GREAT breakfast restaurants in short walking distance  
P => There are MUCH better options the good the bad and the ugly  Good Great room or nice paint  nice lobby and good breakfast buffet  The bad Terrible view from my deluxe room on the th floor  Looked out over a dirty roof and peeling paint brick walls  no elevator older carpet in the hallways  The ugly AAARGH  the walls are as one reviewer said before VERY thin  Each sneeze thump and bump is heard like in your own room  In my case i was surrounded on two sides by some very late night very loud couples  no escape for the entire weekend  Add to this no pool the sauna is TINY and tucked out of the way in the basement and an awkward to say the least parking situation   and you must consider this hotel well below any of   other options in the same class of service in montreal  I will NEVER stay there again  
P => I concur nice but hot    As with several other reviews listed for this hotel I concur that the experience is generally a good one  The staff was helpful the location good and room ent  However I found the temperature in the room to be unpredictable and apparently out of my control  It was warm and humid during the three days I was in Montreal so that is definitely a factor  Also I would compare the continental breakfast to that of any low end U S  hotel  with dry and unappealing pastry and only   milk for the coffee  After one bite and one sip I promptly walked two blocks down Sherbrooke to a wonderful french boulangerie for a cheap and wonderful breakfast  
P => Charming hotel

P => perfect weekend  
P => Elegance at an affordable price   
P => Great location   
P => Nicht empfehlenswert

P => hotel sympathique  
P => Sehr nettes kleines Boutique Hotel  
P => 
P => BED BUGS ALERT Awful place to stay as I encountered BED BUGS and brought them home with me  Myself and friend have awful bites all over our armshands and back   If you actually choose to stay here check your head board for mites   ours was literally INFESTED  Most disgusting thing ive ever seen  
P => Not the best This hotel was nice in its day but is now quite worn  The room appeared fairly clean but the furniture was old and stained the curtains were falling off the rod on one side the hand lotion in the bathroom was half empty and had not been replaced and the only treadmill in the exercise room was broken  The af coffee was never replaced during my stay and with only one or two attendants the front desk was always too busy to wait to ask for more  On the positive side the location was fairly convenient only a few blocks from the Metro the free internet was fast and the room had a large walk in closet  
P => Good value if your expectations are clear  Stayed in room  for two nights in tember with friends to see the city and do some shopping  Some of the reviews on Trip Advisor made me leery about staying  However the property is located easy walking distance from shopping and restaurants  The neighbourhood is safe  The rooms are dated basic but do include a small kitchenette which is convenient  The parking garage is dark but that is standard for and old city like Montreal I would not stay here if the hotel was the most important part of your stay but for a weekend with friends on the cheap we payed  per night   it is a good value  
P => Great location First time at this hotel and the location was great for shopping nightlife and the metro all were in walking distance  The hotel was clean and the room was clean and spacious  However speaking on the room I must say they need upgraded beds and pillows  They were probably the most uncomfortable bed in a hotel that I have slept in  The room we stayed in had a kitchenette and was a great idea as the fridge and microwave came in handy  
P => The hotel is clean and inexpensive but    This is probably a known party hotel  The rooms are large and inexpensive and the hotel itself is huge  To its credit there was a concert in town but reading some of the other reviews it seems like this happens often  We were woken up several times during the night by the rooms around us  Upon check in there was an issue with my room rate which was never resolved but it wasnt a huge issue for me  The front desk staff was less than friendly including the supervisor  She seemed to become a bit nicer later on and the next morning  The staff did not seem very confident and probably needed some more training  The room was clean and the hotel was fairly close to some ent attractions  The free internet was appreciated  This is why I gave it an average rating and not less  I would not stay here again if I were going to spend time exploring Montreal  For one night it served its purpose  
P => Didnt sleep that night The hotel has fair price and good location in quite street near downtown  The building looks good yet checking in took some time bcz  employee was working at pm on    The room is OK but the gaz was broken and  other stuff werent in good shape but it wasnt a big issue  HOWEVER as of midnight there was shouting all over the hotel with teenagers screaming and talking in the corridors and people fighting among each other  WE called reception but no one answered   We were afraid to leave the room bcz of all the drunk young people going around banging on the doors and saying obscene words  This fiasco lasted up to am and the police were called in  times  The next day we checked out bcz that is no place for families or for people who want to have a good night sleep  The hotel slogan quotSatisfaction guaranteed or you money back quot is one big lie  We moved to Residence Inn iott accross the street which was better  cleaner  safer  amp cheaper   
P => Great Experience and Hope More Feel the Same Wow    be I got lucky or be some people expected a  star resort for  a night but I have NO idea why this hotel reeived so many negative reviews My wife and I were in Montreal for four days and we were very satisfied with our stay  We booked a king bed suite and actually got a suite not just a big room with a couch in it  It seems like the hotel was once an apartment complex with an upper and lower landing  On the upper landing was a mini kitchen the bathroom a walk in closet and a dining area  On the lower landing was the bed as well as a desk and bureau with TV The bathroom was adequate and clean  The kitchen had a full stove fridge and enough silverware and plates to cook dinner for two  It even had a cake pan The closet was so big you could hold our bags and seven or eight stowaways if necessary no    really  The dining nook was nice for those nights we ided to eat in The bed was comfortable the TV worked just fine and the desk was a perfect place to set up the laptop  The wi fi was a little slow at times but always worked  The lower landing also had a balcony that was far from orative but a great place to bring out a chair and read the newspaper or wind down with a beer  We never turned on the AC opting instead to open up a vent near the sliding glass door for a cool breeze on the st floor As for the parking I cant comment because we didnt have a car in Montreal  Montreal is such a pedestrian friendly city it makes no sense to rent a car and park it in any garage cramped or not for  or  a day  The Clarion is located within three blocks of TWO metro stations and is only about  blocks from the Crescent district  St  Catherines street is one block to the north so you are always near restaurants shops and grocery stores  The neighborhood is a little run down but what do you expect for a  year old neighborhood We never felt threatened day or night by our surroundings  The front desk was occasionally busy the lobby is small but I waited be  minutes to check in and had an immediate check out  And as for the elevators for crying out loud people    if you dont like the elevators take the friggin stairs  See how quotbadquot the elevators are as youre huffing and puffing while going up  flights of stairs  Better yet use the gym on the first floor a gem in the building Overall I would recommend this hotel for young couples who dont mind a little walk to a Metro station or cooking up a store bought pizza in the oven instead of spending  at a restaurant  If you want a  star hotel go to Le Centre Sheraton  If you want a nice hotel with a gorgeous view of Mount Royal from your balcony for about  a night than this is the place for you  
P => Unsatisfactory Service And All Night Partying At The Clarion Montreal We recently stayed at the Clarion Hotel on Boulevard de Maissoneuve for three nights e   and were very disappointed with the quality of service provided by this establishment  While we had a satisfactory stay at this location one year ago we feel we must give this hotel an unsatisfactory rating on this occasion  A negative check in experience on our first day in Montreal was followed the next day by the  night from hell  as we were subjected to all night partying by underage teenagers  The hotel was ill prepared to deal with this situation and should be very embarrassed about its reputation   While we did receive some compensation from the hotel s front desk manager we feel that we must comment on our experience at this hotel because there are customer service issues security concerns and major concerns for guest safety that must be addressedUpon check in on e  at  p m  the gentleman checking us in was not successful in getting my American Express card to swipe through the electronic credit card reader  Two different machines were tried  It was a recently activated card but I d already used the card twice to purchase gasoline in two different cities and it worked flawlessly  I asked the receptionist to call American Express to see if there was a problem with the card and he refused  I called American Express on my cellular telephone and they informed me that the card was valid and that the hotel should call their hotline a   number and ask for a verification code on the card  The receptionist refused to do this saying that if the card couldn t be swiped it was no good  I then called the desk supervisor over and she also indicated that the hotel could not accept the card if it would not swipe  She also refused to call the credit card company to verify the card  The supervisor did try the card again and was successful in getting it to swipe after her second try We certainly started out on the wrong foot at the Clarion and this hotel should be embarrassed to have such an incompetent staff manning the front desk  That a modern day hotel would not have a way of manually entering a credit card number and verifying its validity is something that we find quite incredible and unacceptable  We used the credit card several times in Montreal at various restaurants and without problems or incidents during our stay On Friday e  we came back to our room   at  p m  and found sheets covering the hallway outside our room  We wondered what was going on as we hadn t been informed by the front desk that any maintenance work was being performed on this date  My wife who is handicapped uses a wheelchair and the sheets made it extremely difficult to manouvre the wheelchair in the hallway  At  p m  five hours later I approached the receptionist at the front desk and asked why the sheets were there  She informed me that the carpets had been cleaned that day and that the sheets were there to protect the carpets  I asked if the sheets could be removed from the hall and was told that people would be called to remove the sheets shortly  At  I called down to the receptionist again and she indicated that the sheets would not be removed until the morning  Please note that at no time either when our booking was made or upon checking in were we informed of any maintenance work to be performed at the hotel  That the hotel would not have closed this floor off for this type of maintenance is unconscionable  I also checked on several other floors and observed that sheets had been placed on those floors as well  Later on that evening we realized that the carpets had not been cleaned and that the sheets were in fact placed there to protect the carpets in the hallway from all night underage partygoers After  pm on e  we became aware that the Clarion on rue de Maissoneuve in Montreal Quebec had been targeted for a noisy all night teenage after prom party  Several complaints to the front desk drew little and very ineffective responsive action  The front desk claimed to be dealing with the problem but seemed content to have their regular law abiding guests accept the chaotic situation The following infractions of unacceptable conduct were observed  Partying in halls and rooms  More guests in the rooms than allowed under the fire safety code  Excessively loud music  Youngsters banging on doors in the middle of the night  Loud groups on balconies  Smoking on non smoking floors in rooms balconies and in corridors and stairwells  Shouting and loud swearing  Underage drinking  Beer and liquor bottlescans left in the hallways stairwells and elevators  Condom box left on the floor of one of the elevators  Hashijuana found in stairwell  All night noiseIt was blatantly apparent that this Clarion Hotel was understaffed during the night as our calls to the front desk went unanswered  The line to the front desk rang repeatedly for well over one hundred rings following repeated tries and there was no response from anyone at the front desk when we tried to call hotel staff  In effect the front desk could not respond to any safety concerns at night because the hotel is so short staffed  My wife is handicapped and if the hotel was so ill equipped to handle loud party goers we wonder how this establishment would handle a medical emergency or a fire emergency perhaps from a teenager smoking in a bed  There is a major concern as the disabled room is located on the fourth floor  Should a fire occur the elevator would be out of service and I would be unable to get my wife down to safety unaided  Note that in fact the elevator did appear to be out of service in the middle of the night  It is obvious that any emergency situation that might occur in this hotel would result in a disaster beyond anyone s imagination The morning following the partying the corridors stairwells and elevators resembled a war zone  This mess remained throughout the hotel for most of the day and the establishment only had one caretaking employee charged with cleaning the corridors for the entire building  Where the prom partying took place on Friday evening the corridors were still not completely cleaned and no vacuuming had been done  This clearly highlights this hotel s severe understaffing once again and demonstrates that the hotel staff is ill prepared to deal with any type of emergency situation that might come along I spoke with the front desk manager on Saturday e   Many other guests had complained about the noise and rowdiness in the hotel during the night on Friday  This manager did agree to refund the cost of one night s stay to us  While we did appreciate this gesture it was a very small one considering the unacceptable conduct of the teenage guests on Friday night and the unacceptable level of service the hotel provided or did not provide to deal with emergencies  The manager made excuses for the low level of service blaming everything on staff cutbacks  When asked if there were security cameras in the hallways he stated that cameras were only present in the front lobby area and none were present in the hallways because those were not allowed under Quebec law  We know in fact that cameras are allowed in hallways in Montreal because we checked with one of the competing popular hotel chains in the city and their facilities have cameras in all their corridors and in all public areas Because security and safety are such a concern in this hotel we are making the following recommendations  Increasing the number of front desk personnel particularly at night  Currently only one staff member is assigned to the night shift   Security card access for guests to use the elevators  A night security guard dedicated to patrolling the hallways to ensure that order is maintained  Security cameras installed in the all corridors stairwells front lobby and parking garage  These should be equipped with video recording devices  Enforcing the legal numbers of guests allowed to occupy a roomWe do not believe that this establishment would pass a government inspection or a Canadian Automobile Association Inspection following our experience there over our brief stay  For that reason we have launched complaints with Choice Hotels The Quebec Government and the Canadian Automobile Association  Hopefully the hotel management will acknowledge the problems we have addressed and take some action  
P => Very nice hotel I cannot quite understand the many negative reviews this hotel has gotten as we had a very pleasant experience here We had not booked in advance but i had made a mental note in regards to the very competitive pricing and checking in on a Thursday evening without reservations was not a problem neither was extending our stay for Friday  The people at the front desk were friendly and knowledgeable about the area Our room was on the th floor fairly spacious and very clean with a comfortable queen sized bed a full kitchen with even a real stove and enough dishes glassware and utensils to prepare a simple meal for two  We also had a terrace which offered a nice view over Mont Royal Having read previous reviews I was prepared for a long wait at the elevators but during the  days of our stay we never had to wait longer than  minutes even during the morning check out rush and on most occasions an elevator arrived within  seconds  There was some wait at the front desk however which with only two attendants and an excessively ringing phone seemed somewhat understaffed We were charged a rate of  plus tax per night which was a lot cheaper than downtown hotels closer to the center of town which were asking for  and up  Parking cost extra I believe it was  per day and I do agree that the garage is small and it takes some maneuvering to get around but we did not encounter any major problems with our mid sized SUV There are lots of restaurants superkets and shopping centers close by and the closest metro station lies only  blocks away An overall very satisfying experience and I would stay here again without hesitation  
P => Hated It Ive stayed at the Clarion between   and had some good and bad experiences GoodHaving your own kitchen is definitely a plus  Cooking a light meal and eat it at your leisure makes me feel like home  I stayed in the ior suites and had plenty of room to place my luggages bags etc   BadI think the clearning crew mustve been very lazy or they get paid somewhat a low wage  Bathroom Its cleaned everyday BUT there are rooms for improvement  I walked into the bathroom one day and noticed a price tag I threw away into the basket bin earlier in the morning is now in the toilet  The cleaning person obviously didnt flush the toilet or else heshed noticed theres a piece of paper in there Bed Its made everyday BUT I noticed they just threw the extra pillow on the cover  It looks like someone was in a hurry and didnt bother placing it in its proper place MiscI dont think they really clean everything in that room during my stay  I noticed there was a strind of hair on my bedside table and my lotion bottle was knocked down one day when I got back to the suite ElevatorsThere are  elevetors in the building  I didnt have to wait for long to go up to my floor  BUT going down was a different story  Unless you leave the hotel at amish youll have to wait   mins for an elevator  I got so fed up during the rest of my stay that I just took the stairs and walked to the main floor One night I was waiting for the elevators on the main floor  There was a cleaning person changing the bags in the garbage bins  I assumed the bag has a hole or be something fell out from the bin  The person sweared right there in front of me  Although he was swearing loudly in a different language but it just so happened that I understand what he was saying  I gave him a look and then quickly hopped into the elevator Check OutThere was one person working at reception in the morning  Everyday I passed by the desk Id see a queue waiting to checkout  I had to wait  mins to check out at am  The management should know better to place more people at Reception  The lady who was serving didnt get help until am  She had to multi tasks between people checking out answer telephone calls and people dropping by to leave things for her  etc   etc   be I am a picky person  Hence Im noticing all these little things  But overall i dont think Ill come back to this place again  
P => Great Experience We booked the summer special stay the first two nights and the third night is half price and breakfasts are included  Breakfast is two eggs your choice of sausage or bacon toast juice coffee or tea  The room is upgraded to an executive suite and it was very clean and comfortable  Fully equipped kitchen arate bedroom great air conditioning bathroom is a little dated but again clean and comfortable  All the staff were great and very helpful  Two blocks to the subway but you can walk anywhere  Grocery store around the corner and good shopping on St  Catharine Street  The BEST restaurant was Enzos on Crescent Street  The food was excellent the prices were very reasonable and the staff was amazing  They will make you things that are not even on the menu If you are visiting Montreal you must dine here 
P => Avoid this hotel if possible The only good thing about this hotel is its location  Everything else is just bad  There are only  elevators not enough for  floor hotel and they are slow so theres a constant line up a few of times we had to wait for   minutes  Rooms are not clean  My gf have found a hair and some dirt on the wall of the bathtub the carpets were dusty and the bed cover was not washed probably for a year   Receptionists are rude and completely useless dont even bother to ask them anything   They save even on shampoo and soap there were not enough supplies for  of us for the whole period and they didnt bother to bring any more   Hotel website says it has a quotspa tubquot  But in fact its a small smelly chlorine plus stale water and quite dirty pool of water hotel employees are walking around it in their street shoes  I have never seen anyone use it In short stay away from this hotel therere plenty of better places in Montreal 
P => Okay Stay at the Clarion In my opinion the reviews on this site are a bit harsh  I found the room to be clean and spacious  we had a suite  I thought the location was close to the subway we were there for the Montreal Jazz Festival  The center of town is about a   min walk away which was great for us to stretch our legs I will agree that the elevators were slow and should be updated  I would also agree that the parking garage is very dangerous and also needs to be updated  Overall I think the hotel is fine for the money spent unless we just got lucky  
P => A little puzzled by some of the terrible reviews My wife and I booked an executive suite through Expedia ca for    and  and paid about  a night  For this we got a clean fairly spacious one bedroom apartment with a kitchen that had wine glasses crockery a few pots and pans    enough to do some simple cooking  We also had a pretty good sized balcony As others have noted the small lobby and the two elevators are a bit of a problem but we managed to get checked in and checked out without too much of a wait  The wifi was free and worked fine The Clarion is not exactly overflowing with staff I think during our visit there was just one person at reception at all times  The woman who checked us in seemed to be juggling about seven things at once but she did it exceedingly well and service was courteous  We had to park about a block and a half down the street at a private lot but thats because we didnt book parking in advance  The fee at the private lot was surprisingly modest     for both days The only real glitch was that when we returned exhausted at the end of the second day neither of our key cards worked  But the front desk fixed this immediately  The place seemed fairly busy but we were not awakened at  a m  by noisy drunks as we were a few weeks earlier at a more upscale Montreal hotel  All in all Id describe the Clarion as pretty good value for the money  
P => Disgusting rude guests staff and conditions  The Clarion in Montreal takes the cake for the most disgusting establishment I have ever stayed at  My boyfriend and I drove from Ottawa into Montreal to finish our Canadian vacation in the fall and poorly chose this place to stay because of its somewhat affordable rate  We could hardly drive on the street due to construction and parking was an utter mess    the garage is a hazard in every way with a one way circular ramp into the garage and low ceilings with poor lighting The room was as clean as one would hope for we only had ginal issues with the actual room  We were exhausted from driving and because of the hotels inconvenient location and frightening garage we chose not to venture far when we sat down to eat at the restaurant the waitress walked over and pretty much told us the food at the hotel was horrible and suggested we find somewhere else to eat   we ended up finding a pretty nice place down the street Apparently the same night we were staying there an entire high school group was staying in the same general wing of the hotel though not sure if they were on our floor or elsewhere  The shouting and banging and hollering never stopped  Our phone rang off the hook with prank calls and random French messages  We complained multiple times and we told that other people had also complained and nothing was done  We heard a front desk person tell these loud guests to shut up many times to no avail Anyway there were two nights of this insanity and we were glad to get out  The entire experience was horrid and disgusting    the area the hotel the staff unwilling to do anything to shield good guests from rude ones I wrote Clarion HQ a letter with a very detailed complaint and they basically sent me an e mail to tell me there was nothing they can do    great customer service huh Well never go back there and if you are reading this the reviews should speak for themselves   this hotel is horrible  I wouldve rather slept in my car  
P => Worst Nights Sleep Ever This is NOT a Hotel    it is more of a rooming house full of very inconsiderate guests My husband and I stayed here to avoid staying with relatives on the long weekend but ended up being woken up BOTH nights by drunkards trying to get into our room and their own The walls are paper thin people seem to live there on a weeklymonthly basis and yell down the halls at all hours of the night the doors have a horrible closing mechanism that echos down the hall and the hotel had no parking available  I did not get any sleep not only because of the noise but also the beds were so hard I might as well have been sleeping on the floor and the pillows were very very lumpy and thin  Do yourselves a favor and stay at a hostel this place is the WORST hotel Ive ever been in  
P => Fancy a Wait for Lifts Stayed here as part of a Tour Party and found the hotel to be not as bad as some of the reviews posted on here unless of course we were lucky  The rooms were big and the kitchen area was small but lets be honest who goes to Montreal on holiday to spend a lot of time in the room   the beds were clean and comfortable and the room intself was large   What has been said about the lifts is true   we waited about  mins one day for them and most of the time I walked up and down the stairs fortunately we were on on the th floor    The bar is poor though we went for a drink about   one night and it had ran out of drht lager and wine and the service was pretty slow  The breakfast we had one morning was fine and reasonable priced  The area the hotel was in was not the best but I never felt overly threatened and its more central than some of said   only about a  minute walk to the Crescent which is an area full of bars and restaurants  Overall I would say this hotel is not the best but dont know technically how much we paid for it as it was all included in the tour price 
P => Dont Stay here First of all we requested  rooms next to eachother with pullout couches  The person on the phone said this would not be a problem but when we got in our rooms were  floors apart and no couch in either or them  The  floors wouldnt have been a big deal if you didnt have to wait for the elevators for so long  Having no couches was a problem seeming how there were  of us for  beds  They gave us rooms  floors apart on the second night that at least had couches after we complained  Trust me the rooms are crappy so the hassle wasnt worth it  Also It is a good distance away from the action  I mean it is walkable but if you are staying at this hotel you are probably going for the bars and you are going to get drunk so the walk was a bit longer than I wanted  The funniest part of the hotel experience was when we asked where the ice machines were and the front desk person told us if we wanted ice we could go to the store to buy it Do not stay here no matter how cheap of a hotel you want  
P => Sheets not changed wait for elevator unsafe garage Perhaps I should start with the positives before I get to the negatives  My friends and I stayed at the Clarion Hotel the weekend of ust    We stayed in an Executive suite which includes a bedroom with a queen sized bed and a sofa bed in the living room  There is a TV in both rooms  The fridge and microwave in the kitchen came in very handy for midnight snacks  It is located quite close to shopping on St  Catherines  minute walk and its about a  minute walk to trails up Mount Royal At first glance the hotel seemed ent but we soon found something VERY disturbing  Underneath the pillow lay an old t shirt Unless Clarion has started a complimentary pyjama service we were certain that it did not belong there nor did it belong to any of us  We informed reception of the situation   that the sheets were not changed   and they sent one fresh pillow and sheet  However the presence of the t shirt is an obvious indicator that the entire bed was not changed and so we had to call reception again to request a second pillow and sheet  Despite the fact that the situation was corrected it did not restore our confidence in the housekeeping practices at this hotel  The manager was reluctant to compensate us  At first she claimed that quotthe sheets are definitely cleanquot as housekeeping cleans them every day  We had to argue this because it is clear that anything left in the bed means that it was not cleaned properly  She ended up giving us complimentary parking a savings of  off a bill of   for  nights  She claimed that because we had pre paid with Hotels ca she couldnt do anything else Even if the sheets were clean we still would not go back to this hotel  The elevator as mentioned on another review is ancient  The hotel has only  elevators which has a maximum capacity of  persons each which services over  floors  We waited almost  minutes for an elevator that wasnt full and this occured on many occassions Finally the underground parking garage was simply unsafe  It is extremely cramped making parking for vehicles larger than sedans quite challenging if not impossible  Also the ramps were narrow but also  way  There are no signs indicating  way traffic and accidents could easily occur if someone wasnt looking around the corner as there were no convex mirrors either  To exit the garage you have to swipe your card at the bottom of the exit ramp  As we were leaving the garage door began to close and we had to break in avoid being hit We had to reverse the car down the steep ramp to open the door again  Seeing as how we drove up the exit ramp at an acceptable speed this is completely unacceptable  If you are considering a stay in Montreal definitely look elsewhere first unless you dont expect to drive there take the elevator to the th floor or sleep in clean sheets  
P => Noisy We booked this hotel through Canadian Affair travel agent at a cost of about   per night This is not a typical hotel   each room contains a sleeping area a small kitchen and a diningliving area  Its all quite small but if youre on a budget the kitchen will help keep eating costs down  Everything was clean and tidy but the kitchen equipment was slightly outdated The location is some distance from central Montreal where many of the bars and restaurants are located  Walking is definitely possible but it takes a while and at night we didnt feel   safe walking along Rue Maisonneuve in the vicinity of the hotel  It is probably safer and easier to take the Metro to the Atwater station which is a couple of blocks away Our biggest complaint about the hotel was the fact that we had one night where we were kept awake until after am by a party on our corridor It turns out that most of the rooms on the corridor were taken by US high school kids who had travelled to Montreal because the drinking age limit is lower Despite calls to reception nothing was done about it and the noise made it impossible for us to sleep until the last student passed outI appreciate that this  well be a rare occurrence but we felt that the hotel staff didnt go out of their way to help resolve the situation  When we spoke to reception in the morning they said that they sympathised with us and told us that the students wouldnt be staying there again There was no apology or offer of recompense  
P => Clarion Montreal one word  Awful  I stayed the weekend of ust   and will absolutely never stay again  I had a quotsuitequot which consisted of a twin mattress whichthey said was a queen bed which was hard as a rock and a pull out sofa bed  nights with tax totalled  CAD  I agree with the other review from that weekend the elevator in this hotel seems likesomething from cold war russia and badly needs to be serviced or replaced  Parking at the hotel is also a huge mess I was able to getinto the garage but you have never seen a moor poorly designed garage  Most folks end up parking in lots which charge   CAD every  hours  I also believe they age discriminate  I was forced tosign a quotno visitor or alcolhol clause for my roomquot by the front desk Being in my late s this was insulting and appeared no where on their website  This hotel is also is completely unsecure anyone can walk in or take the elevator at anytime they wish and its not exactly in the nicest part of the St  Catherines street area  Oh and its near absolutely nothing  If youre an American looking to visit montreal completely avoid this pathetic excuse for a hotel thatis no where near anything on St  Catherines  
P => Pretty ok for what you pay The hotel is ok for what you pay  The room we got was ok too  The kitchen is fully equipped as promissed and a little bit bigger than I expected  It is not like your own kitchen but you will get the basic things During the weekend you  have some noisy neighbors  The elevators are not fast enough so you  expect some backup  The towels were almost always missing in the whirpool and sauna  The recepcionists are very nice but the rest of the staff at least the ones I met could be more corteous Regarding the location it is pretty close to the subway  You can get to lots of places in Montreal without using your car  The surrondings are a bit rundown but the hotel is pretty close to lots of restaurants and bars  There is plenty of people walking around this area at night  You can find places that are closer to the real downtown but I am not sure if that is necessarely a good thing  I suppose the real downtown  be too empty at night  
P => Great location ent rooms poor service  The room included   queen bed night tables  smaller TV and table  eating table and chairs  full kitchen with fridge stove toaster microwave limited utensils cookware and dish wares  full bathroom with bathtubLOCATIONThe Clarion is located in a fairly nice area of west Montreal on De Maisonneuve West close to the Guy Metro  The area has a nice charm with unique to Montreal architecture and it is close to many attractions by walking or by Metro  You can walk to Rue Crescent in under  minutes and Rue Ste  Catharine is a block south  The back alley is dirty and dodgy  The area was under construction as of y  AMENITIESThe hotel has a sauna and whirlpool fitness centre and a bar on site but I did not use them during my stay  The free wireless internet worked well  PARKINGUnderground parking is available for vehicles less than  feet at an outrageous price of   per night  Other lots in the area are cheaper if you dont mind outdoor parking however break ins thefts and vandalism are bad in Montreal especially if you drive a nice car or one with American plates CLEANLINESSThe hotel is clean although it has signs of abuse scuff ks scratches etc probably from the party goers at the hotel  COMFORTThe air conditioners in the rooms are horribly loud and do not work well at dehumidifying the room  These brutal machines really disrupted watching TV doing work and especially sleeping I might not ever come back to this hotel because of them The comfort of the furnishings was average  The TV was a little small too SERVICEThere was confusion with my reservation on their part and it took quite a long time to resolve  The woman was not very friendly although she probably puts up with a lot of BS from people every day at this hotel  Aside from the reservation mix up I had no problems with the service OVERALLThis hotel would be a great place for families to stay however the party crowds who frequent this hotel would keep me from bringing my family to stay there  It is great for those who enjoy cooking once and a while while travelling and those on business trips with colleagues  That said I will be putting this hotel on my last choice list when visiting Montreal until they replace those air conditioners  
P => Great experience  I stayed at the Clarion from  th to  th   nights with my boyfriend  At the check in it was a bit long because the girl at the front desk was alone  But she was very friendly and did some jokes with the people  No problem with my reservation already paid so I took the electronic cards for my room and I went to it on the th floor  This room was very clean nice bed and big windows  It was a ior suite with a queen size bed non smoking  The window can be opened its like a patio door  You have also a little kitchen with everything you need to cook a light meal but a note advise you to clean the kitchen because if its not clean when youre leaving a  can be charged on your account  In front of the bed theres a tv with cable channels and paying movies like   CAD for a movie    no thanks  Even if we were not that high the view was great take a look at my pictures  You already know that it is a great location because everyone said it before and its true  A lot of restaurants stores bars superkets etc  Near to metro Guy and metro Atwater Place Alexis Nihon a great underground mall  Of course  tiny elevators for more than  floors its not the best  But I took the stairs  times and it wasnt that bad sometimes we were  in the elevator but some others times I didnt wait and I was alone  Theres a laundry room working with change thats good  The bathroom is very very clean  I paid  tax included per night and it was quiet even if there was a lot of people  The maid I talked to was polite friendly and nice  The check out was faster than the check in there was two girls at the front desk  We enjoyed our week end and would go there again  Thanks for reading me and contact me if you have questions 
P => Been going here for  years    Really good for the price Ive been traveling to Montreal as an adult for almost  years and stayed at  different downtown area hotels  I made the Clarion my hotel of choice back in   I stay in the Executice Suites with anywhere from   other guys  The average cost is usually CAD  tax AAA price  First off let me say Ive been more then happy with the size of the rooms  Like I said weve fit  grown men in  room with no comfort issues  The rooms are always clean stocked with everything weve needed    and the one time there was a issue of having no hot water in the shower they had it fixed within the hour  Location was very important in picking the Clarion  Its in a good neighborhood and in reasonable walking distance to the downtown area  The Forum is two blocks over Cresent is about a  minute walk    The  main downsides I have with the Clarion is the parking and elevators  The underground parking lot is down an alley behind the hotel  Its not hard to find but its gets difficult navigating through it once you get into the lot  Low clearances and narrow spaces make SUVs and larger sixed cars pretty difficult to get in and out of spots  The elevators issue is that theres only  and having to accomodate  floors can make the wait a bit of pain in the neck  Other then that I have no complaits about it the staff as always been accomodating and very friendly  At the moment I havent found anything better for the price they offer  
P => Line Up Stay For New Years Eve   Paid CAD night  TAX This is an OK hotel with problems Good things about this hotel    Good location   Good size room with tiny kitchen amp dine table I just going list things i dont like from this hotel   Lobby is so small that i need  minutes in line just to check in    minutes for tiny and superslow elevators   Heating system in the room is so noisy   Sound proofing is questionable  If hotel is fully booked the canches is youll have no hot water Pls dont choose this hotel on high season its a nighte  
P => Good Im from Toronto and I came to Montreal for Halloween weekend  Im  and I came with other friends   amp  I had my wallet stolen from me in the club district on Crescent Street  Careful peopleAnyways we arrived Montreal early in Friday morning and were able to check into the hotel by PM  Before that though we called the hotel to ask if we could come in a bit earlier and they said no  Then I called again and they didnt have my RESERVATION in the system  This pissed me off  They told me to call back ChoiceHotels ca to see what happened since I did book through them  After all that we got our room at pm We had the Executive Suite  It was clean and nice  or isnt all that great but I knew I wasnt staying at the Hyatt hotel or anything  Reception maids and service was all good  I dont understand why people in other reviews said they were rude  The hotel is an easy   minute walk from the Metro subway and plaza with grocery store amp shopping and the movie theatre The kitchen had everything for us to cook with  Just no hand soap  But there was dishwashing soap  They do need more garbage bags  The  of us accumulate too much garbage I slept in the room with the Queen Size bed and I was cold  Even with the heater on  The Living room was more heated than the bedroom was and its true the elevator is slow  The toilet needs some time to flush as well  dont over fill it with tissue  and the lock on the bathroom can be tricky so we didnt use itOverall everything was fine  
P => Reations Complete  This place is a  best deal  We stayed at this hotel several years ago when it was called the Manoir LeMoyen  Now that reations are complete and the property is part of the Clarion group  this place has become the best deal that we encountered in quite some timeBy all means ask for a no smoking room and a room looking north when making your reservations  We checked in quite late  close to midnight and were welcomed hospitably and provided with all the room details requested   we ended up on the th floor with a view to the mountainThe front desk was able to provide us with directions to the late night quotdepanneurquot stores in the area so we could stock up for a lazy breakfast the next morning We had a queen size room  Very well outfitted  Good live work area  Nice sitting room with couch and chair dinette AND a most comfortable office area with good office grade chair and free WIFI in the price of the room   CDN per night   check hotel website for specialsRoom service was spot on   if a tad too efficient  We had a difficult time convincing room staff with notes that we did not need a change of sheets and to save the environment Situated between  Metro stops and minutes walk to the shops in Westmount and downtown Montreal  this was a dream location Be warned   dont attempt the underground garage in anything much larger than a midsize car  But with transportation so close at hand  why bring a car into the city in the first placeA great experience for a  day stay 
P => Good in parts       We stayed here for  nights last week It is a very tall building some  floors with only  lifts which becomes a REAL problem at popular times or when groups are checking in or out ROOM   very clean and spacious nice kitchenette area small bathroom but with lovely powerful shower and nice big white fluffy towels Comfortable bedsThey are a bit stingy with the coffee they provide   so be sure to take your own  One per person per day just looks mean The windows are floor to ceiling which I dont care for on the th floor  Nor were the windows properly fitted as the curtains moved around in the wind   and the nets needed a good wash There were extremely high winds while we were there and it could be heard whirling around We also had a problem ALL one night with a faulty smoke alarm  They did fix it immediately the next day and that wasnt anyones fault Not much in the way of views just flat rooftops Location is ok   but quite a walk into the centre and very little of any real interest we were disappointed in Montreal felt it could have been any major city nothing specialBar meals in the hotel are expensive Overall   OK but nothing outstanding  
P => Noisy Just a word of caution   this hotel is completing reations through     The noise is unbelievably loud and prevents any kind of rest or relaxation  It is impossible to sleep on any floor after  a m  I stayed here one night and the next morning people in the lobby were talking about it and the front desk phone was ringing with comlaints as I checked out  
P => Perfect for a long stay Ive come not to expect much when booking a hotel from an online name your price website but this hotel treated us just like a regular patron  All in all this hotel worked really well for a mom and  yo son for their first visit to Montreal  Granted we had just come from a top notch hotel in downtown Montreal where we were very disappointed so we didnt have high expectations  Our room was nicely appointed and the kitchen worked great for us  There is a superket about a block away and other small kets in the neighborhood  It was very reminiscent of living in Europe  We would get fresh baguettes daily usually ate one meal a day in the room  We also ordered room service while there and were pleased  There was a nice bistro by the hotel and we enjoyed sidewalk dining  The staff was great and patient with us working on our French  The area is a few blocks from downtown but we rather enjoyed the solitude and felt like we saw more of the local flavor  Parking wasnt the most convenient but Ive seen worse in a large city  The front desk was great about arranging a local a couple of bus tours for us to Quebec City that far exceeded my expectations For currency exchange theres one around the corner from the hotel with the best rates we found in Quebec  Overall for night we were more than impressed with the hotel and our accommodations and would stay there again  
P => Not great Stayed here in tember   The price was fair and room was ok but there is only a double bed  If you stay here make sure you do not get a room overlooking the back alley  The noise begins at  am  Also make sure you have lots of time to check in and out  It took me over  minutes to check in yet there were only  or  people ahead of me  It only took  minutes to check out with no one in front of me  They constantly answer the phone when serving you  The hotel is within walking distance of down town  
P => Good value ent location I stayed here for  nights with my boyfriend and it was really reasonable for the price  Its about a   minute walk to the main shopping area downtown  Restaurants and superkets are very close by and a great convenience with the small kitchen the rooms have especially if you want to save money on meals The elevators are slow so I would suggest requesting a room on the third or fourth floor so you can take the stairs if you dont mind giving up the view  Its not amazing but its one of the best deals youll find

P => A Big City Downtown Experience   Montreal Style   Front desk staff overwhelmed by number of people checking in  She was by herself and managed to get through about  customers   Parking is an issue at this hotel  Space for about  cars the smaller the car the better to navigate around the concrete pillars Not a place to practise your parking skills   Hotel rooms are okay  My room needed some work in the bathroom area  Rooms were clean   if you are looking for a view   This is not the place for your stay   This hotel is right in the downtown core  Great place to educate your kids on all different sorts of culture in a big city setting  I felt safe but suggest you take care in the evening time  Police and security were around pretty frequently  People were friendly enough   No pool or high speed internet   Breakfast supplied by Hotel was poor  No milk or cereal  Very basic to say the least  Free coffee  AC worked greatBiggest issue with this locationquotPARKINGquot 
P => Not so bad of a hotel I recently spent  nights with a freind at the Comfort Inn and Suites Downtown  We had to differant rooms and both rooms were clean and comfortable  The hotel is located just off St  Catherine Street  Not a bad locale but it is about a miles to the heart of the shopping district  The Subway is located  blocks from the hotel not a hard walk  If you are arriving by bus its right next store  The parking is free but very limited so get there early and use public transportation to get around  My major complaint is the so called breakfast  Very limited toast or a waffle  hard boiled egg and a very small portion of fruit  Coffee tea or juice thats all  be I am a little spoiled by other Comfort Inns and the large breakfast  This hotel has limited frills but theprice of the rooms are a value  Would not hesitate to stay there again  
P => Spend a few more bucks save yourself from an unpleasant experience  My wife and I stayed at this hotel for  nights in y   Overall this was one of the worst hotels I had stayed at and definitely the worst one I had experienced in Canada  Location This hotel is side by side with a Greyhound garage  Do your best to avoid the rooms on the quotGreyhoundquot side the west wing of the hotel which happen to be cheaper for a reason    Parking Parking is free if available but it is a big IF because the number of spots are much fewer than the number of rooms  When I referred to the reception desk for advice they simply shrugged and told me to use the public parking accross the corner   Rooms This hotel used to be a privately owned and operated hotel called quotTaj Mahalquot and surprisingly the company that operates Comfort Inn hotels hasnt done anything to reate or upgrade the hotel to their own standards  So if you have been to a Comfort Inn elsewhere do not expect to see the same here  Very old and humid rooms  In our case the window was jammed and wouldnt open and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very weak  Very old and minimal furniture  Breakfast Breakfast was free but it was not a buffet breakfast  Actually it was rationed  So youll get a toast with butter and jam a boiled egg and your choice of coffee or juice thinned out  alive and youll get more of anything only if you risk the baleful looks from the breakfast lounge staff which were so unfriendly that made me think they have never been to a restaurant anywhere in Canada My advice spend a few more bucks and stay somewhere else  The saving is not worth ruining your otherwise beatiful trip to Montreal  
P => Not recommended My husband and I stayed here recently on a trip to Montreal and we had a terrible experience  st we read that the hotel offers free parking which is true if there is a spot available  The first evening that we arrived there was no parking at the hotel and so we had to park on the street then at am we had to move the car into a parking garage which we paid  for  hours of parking because a spot finally became available at the hotel  nd the hotel is in front of a Greyhound station and many of the hotel guests were quite questionable our hotel room unfortunately backed out onto the station and so all night we could hear the buses coming and going and the announcements that were made to travelers  rd the room itself was below standard the towels had holes in them and were very very small  The heater in the room was blowing cold air instead of warm I felt that the  outer coversblankets of the bed were not laundered the pillows were very lumpy and worst of all the walls arating the rooms were paper thin I spent one sleepless night due to guests taking next door and I could hear every word at am I finally called in a noise complaint We did not partake in the complementary breakfast  The only perk of the hotel is that we had wireless internet service Overall the hotel unfortunately put a damper on my Montreal experience  I would never stay here again  
P => Needs help We stayed at this hotel for  nights during the Grey Cup  The location is ok with the hotel being right next to the main subway station where all the lines connect and the lobby looks great  Other than that this place needs help  It took us half an hour to check in even though we were the only people there and when I opened my second floor room to see it in a disaster it took another mins to get a quotcleanquot room  I always skip reviews that complain about service but the uncleaned room and the fact that our room only was cleaned  our of the  days we were there should be noted  I suppose they  have cleaned it on the fifth day but we were long gone The room I ended up with was either freezing or boiling depending if you wanted the heat on or not the bathroom had mold everywhere and the roof had a big hole in it and the window couldnt be opened to at least air out the mold smell  We couldve asked for a different room or stayed elsewhere but the other room looked the same and the whole town was booked up for the big game  The free quotbreakfastquot was an eggo on top of a piece of burnt toast with a hard boiled egg and some fruit on a plate  I can see why it was free  I only went once and literally ran out of there  I would give this place a  rating based on price and the nice lady at the checkout side  If they reate the rooms to meet the quality of the lobby or of a more than  star hotel it probably wouldnt be that bad  
P => Ok but oh those buses I stayed here with a friend the last week end of il   Before I booked I read some of the reviews here that indicated a few problems but I also was on a budget and figured I would be ready to accept less than lavish  Well theres lots to recommend this place the price was absolutely very reasonable  a double room with two large double beds and a nice bathroom for around  per night there were lots of towels an in room clothes iron and board a friendly helpful staff and a FREE garage parking lot which although on a first come first serve basis always had a spot available  The location was ideal as well   blocks from St  Catherine and  blocks away from the Olympia Theater where I attended a concert on one of the evenings  This area boasts lots of restaurants shops and stores within a moments walk and the Metro is less than a block away  Yet there are other less inviting items to keep in mind remember low price  so the room amenities are understandably mediocre  there was no clock or clock radio the lamps had nasty dirty shades there was no overhead light fixture no phone on the nightstands its across the room and no stand up luggage rest   The coat rack was small and  despite some instruciton  I still dont know how the heating works  As cited in one of the previous reviews there was also tattered taped carpeting in the halls especially around and in the elevator  All of those items were tolerable however  What was not was the hotels proximity to the bus station  When I read about it before I arrived I thought it would mean that the neighborhood might be sleezy and seedy but in fact the neighborhood is just fine  NO  the BIG problem was the regular annoying announcements of bus arrivals and departures  preceded each time with bell tones  emanating from the stations public address system  which in effect actually acted as a wake up call every so many minutes  It was like Chinese water torture  The sound permeates every room and there was no escaping it even when I buried my head in the lumpy pillows  Too bad  I could have accepted even enjoyed the rest but that one very aggravating aspect of this hotels setting means I wont return  You ide for yourself  
P => Terrible experience at this hotel My husband and I booked a room in this hotel since its the cheapest and it looks nice in the picture  Entrance is nice with those chandeliers and big mirrors but when we got inside the elevator and th hallway we notice the carpet is stained and looks dirty  The room that we had the heater doesnt work  We told the reception about it and the receptionist said he would have someone fix it  We waited until our second complaint  and third complaint they said we have to move to another room  So we did  After two nights on the second room our skin started to get itchy And my husband saw a bug crawling on his skin while hes sleeping  Again we told the receptionist about it  She has to transfer us to another room coz the cleaning lady confirmed there are bugs in our room    We left the hotel with a lot of bed bug bites gross i know and we moved twice Never going back to that hotel after that horrible experience we had  
P => Clean and basic Its a great place to stay if youre in Montreal to partysightsee etc  Its the basic necessities for a ent price  The view isnt great the location is though  Its next to the Greyhound station and about  blocks from Saint Catherine  Everything was clean we ended up with a smoking room not because of availability but some of the people we were staying with wanted a smoking room and we wanted to be next to them that thankfully didnt smell at all like smoke Its a great place to crash and the staff are extremely nice and helpful  
P => Dont Stay Here unless you like bed bugs I stayed here for three nights  The first morning I awoke at am to find bed bugs crawling on the sheets pillow case and headboard and on me  I called the front desk and they were nice about it and moved me to a different room on the other side of the hotel  a newly reated side  I did not see any more bed bugs after that but heard noisey neighbors throughout the next two days and nights  The worst part is that I brought bed bugs home unknowingly and had a full on infestation by e and had to throw away our bed sheets featherbed etc  Not to mention the gross out factor  YUCK 
P => Had a great stay A co worker and I stayed at the hotel for three days and we both liked the place a lot  The hotel is clean very near the bus station which made it easy to get to and from the airport and also within walking distance of many good restaurants  My only complaint is that the room could use one more lamp  Wireless internet access for two arate computers was a big plus and the staff was very helpful when we had problems with connecting  
P => Do not let the price fool you First of all for your budget saving book direct with the hotel so you can get tax refund from Canada government  Use this money to book a better hotel for the pleasant of your trip What I like about this hotel the location which is within walking distance to some attractions and train bus  That is it  However the neighborhood is scary  Homeless and people look like gangster all over the streets  But do not book this hotel because of its location because hotels are everywhere just next to this hotel in the same block  Get the address of this hotel and find a better hotel near by What I dont like about this hotel everything about it  First of all the service  I booked a non smoking room they assigned me a smoking one  I requested to change to a non smoking room but they asked me to stay there one night then come back in the morning to re request it  Fine Beside the smoking smell that night I could not sleep at all because it was too noisy  I felt like I was sleeping on a sidewalk  I could hear every single car went by and people talking and yelling on the street   the whole night  Next day I came down and re requesting to be moved to a non smoking room  They assign me a new room  Great but my happiness couldnt last long  They gave me a room at the end of the hall which was like in a triangle shape  It was too small and dark  Not done yet this room doesnt have central air so they have a window air conditioner installed  You know what your choice privacy or air If I turn on the air I have to open the curtain  If I close the curtain I will have no air  The room and its furniture is too old and looks very cheap  You will not want to take off your shoes and walk on the carpet not even with your socks on so ladies pack some pairs of socks with you if you wear sandals  The carpet looks very dirty  The room only have bottom line basic things not even an alarm clock  The mirror hang on a wall is not even straight  A very small TV sitting on a table that looks like a chair and     shorter than your bed I dont know what they think  So again your choice watch TV or lying down  You have to sit up enable to see the TV If you are tired to sit then lie down and     listen to the TV  haha     sorry After an exhausted day but I still dont want to go back to my hotel  Lying down on a bench at a park is even more comfortable  Their beds are just full size beds not queen size as listed  Ah I forgot that the front desk lady gave us a wrong direction caused us walking like hell all day  Damn itSo think about how much you will save by booking this hotel and is it worth it If you book online you wont be able to get tax refund from Canada Government because the website paid tax to US government  Book direct with the hotel and get the tax refund to pay for your peace of mind  Learn my lesson  Dont let what happen to me also happen to you  Have a pleasant trip  
P => Good Deal for the Budget Traveler Eight of us stayed in two rooms for a week in ust  and were pleasantly surprised  Although there was a jazz festival practically next door and our room had a view of the bus station we were never kept awake by noise from inside or outside the hotel  The rooms were clean and I am picky and the beds were quite firm but incredibly comfortable The staff was completely bilingual courteous friendly and helpful  Because we had an  year old and a one year old with us we needed comfort and convenience above all and we thought the Taj Mahal made up for its somewhat dowdy appearance with the good location and more than adequate accoutrements  We did not eat in the hotel as there were some excellent restaurants nearby try Amir if you are into Lebanese food Montreal is expensive for hotels so we were very pleased with the rates and the value for the money at the Taj Mahal We would all stay here again if returning to Montreal  
P => Great value if you get the right room Stayed at the Taj Mahal for a long weekend this spring  The first room we got was on the older side of the hotel which is close to the bus station next door  This was bad because the bus station is rather noisy and also this is the side of the hotel that was redone less recently  It was a bit shabby and the quotqueenquot bed was actually only a double  We asked to be moved after the first night and when we got to our new room it was like we were in a different hotel The room and the bed was bigger nicer and newer and we really enjoyed our stay from then on We should also note that there is free wireless internet and free parking  The latter is first come first serve though so plan your arrival carefully  The neighborhood isnt the glitziest but its close to the Metro and theres a good sushi place across the street  The hotel restaurant is run by really friendly people with good inexpensive breakfast  I would definitely stay there again but only if I could be assured a room in the nice part of the hotel 
P => Good hotel reasonable rates WOW  I had the same experience  Bad Hotel St  Andre great Taj Mahal  It sits next to the bus terminal and the subway station so you can literally get anywhere from there easily  Across the street is a major shopping complex with everything from clothing to fast food to groceries  And if like I was you are visiting the Village it is the perfect location  
P => Horrible experience The hotel was dark and dingy and the people were terribly rude  Maids walk in your room when they feel like it while even the owner feels it is also necessary to barge into people rooms while they are sleeping  There were over  of us on a breakaway tour package who were harrassed by hotel security numerous times but what do u expect really when you have a  teenagers staying at your hotel  The food in the resturant was horrible but the people at the bar were very nice the only sane people who worked in the hotel  The bathrooms were disgusting specially the public ones that were never cleaned  The sheets were old the lamp shades had cigarette burns in them and so did the rugs  For the current asking price of  bucks a nite you mine as well stay at motel because it definitley is nothing like a hotel  The area is pretty crummy as well although there is a convience store across the street  Overall the hotel is probably the worst hole ive ever stayed in and breakaway tours is just a big rip off  
P => Ignore Negative Reviews Okay     the Taj Mahal Monteal was recommended to me on short notice prior to my trip to Montreal with my teenage dhter to watch the ATP Tennis tournament in ust   The price seemed VERY affordable but Ive always known this area of Montreal to be a bit seedy  Regardless I ignored the negative on line reviews booked our room with a VERY helpful and courteous front desk employee  We checked in to a CLEAN EFFICIENT and QUIET street front room  And  this section of Montreal is now undergoing a fantastic revitalisation     Starbucks included  Ive stayed in less attractive neighbourhoods in NYC The Taj Mahal is located at the hub of the main interchange of the Montreal subway system      but you can easily walk to most downtown attractions  Be aware that the hotel is next to the Montreal bus station which is in operation  so if you are a light sleeper     be sure to book a room away from the bus station A great place to stay      wonderful job by the owners to reclaim this long ignored section near Old Montreal  At approximately  per night     you cant go wrong  
P => Its all about location Lets start with the positive  You dont come to Montreal to sit in your hotel room  You go to Montreal to hang out in the coolest city in Canada  Its the closest thing we have to Europe  That being said the Taj Mahal is perfect in terms of location  You are a hop skip and a jump from Saint Denis and the Latin Quarter with its funky cafes  Its a  minute walk to the main andor to the Museum of contemporary art  To the East its a  minute walk to Parc LaFontaine and also the quotvillagequot is right there too  Its on a well lit street and I felt safe  My room sort of looked like an early s nighte but it was clean and comfortable with adjustable airconditioning and a cool window seat  There was even a table and chairs if I wanted to entertain  The tv got a gazillion channels if that kind of thing is important to you  I had a nice breakfast in the restaurant with a very nice waitress  The lobby is aesthetically pleasing  Now here is what was frustrating about my stay  When I arrived there was a long line up at reception with three people behind the desk  However only one of them seemed to be working and seemed quite rattled and kept on telling us how tired she was  No ones room seemed to be ready and there were a lot of people who seemed to be waiting in the lobby  Anyway a nice trainee checked me in  I returned that night and tried to get into my room with a key card and couldnt and neither could another couple  We went downstairs and the receptionist typed some keys that let us in  The next night THE SAME THING HAPPENED  I went back down and the same receptionist said that I couldnt get in because I was only booked for one night  This was news to me  not to mention the fact that the previous day I had confirmed both with her and the nice trainee that I was staying for two nights  Naturally I was panicked at the thought of being without accomodation late at night in Montreal not to mention wondering where my luggage was  The receptionist did little to reassure me  Eventually it got sorted out sort of and I returned to my room but it left a sour taste  However check out was flawless  
P => I dont care what everyone else says I liked it  My wife and I stayed for two nights at the Hotel Taj Mahal and overall we were quite pleased  While it  not be as luxurious as the name  entail at  Canadian its hard to complain The people manning the front desk were very friendly and helpful and were more than happy to direct us to our destinations and bear with our American ways  Our bedroom was clean and comfortable with a fine view of the other half of the Hotel Taj Mahal  We requested a non bus station facing room and were pleased with the hotel facing quiet accomodations Parking is minimal at best  There are roughly   spots for the hotel but we were able to find parking easily in the mid afternoon  The first day we parked on the street for free it was the weekend The location was excellent  We were only a few blocks from St  Denis with many excellent locations to eat and only a short walk from Old Montreal  Though walking by hobo park read the park adjacent to the bus station was less than appealing it was never a problem Overall it was a great stay  Its obviously not going to be a five star hotel but for what it is the Hotel Taj Mahal provides a clean safe and friendly atmosphere  
P => Overall great stay Clean and modestly priced  The carpeting seemed new staff was friendly  Biggest downside is the limited parking so check in early to get one of the coveted free spaces  Other downside is the seedy characters hanging out across the street who sometimes wander into the hotel  I would however stay here again based on price central location and cleanliness  
P => We Got Futoned    our experience at the Taj Mahal Okay so    be the room is as dark as hell and you have to put down  dollar deposit and the place has a restaurant but no food and the staff stare at you suspiciously everytime you walk in and when you try and enter the front lobby hookers are making you offers just outside and be the electronic destination speaker phone voice goes off every  minutes from the montreal central bus station that happens to be right beside the hotel and be the room looks like it just spawned out of a mix of bad s road side motel rooms evident from the curtains ancient tv and especially the bathroom and be the carpet looks like its alive with fungus and that the bed was probably only made not changed and that the lighting was so dim that the corners of the room were in complete shadow and that the bathroom door made some sorta tapping sound as if it were possesed only when it was closed and you were inside trapped by the sounds of the eerie door and that the tap water tasted like a direct line to the raw sewage plant      but theirs a depaneur across the street so we got lots of booze and stashed it in the large cupboard arrangement behind the bed and made the best of it  so go their if you like cheap tolerable hotels conveniently close to the bus station and in an area of town that has a lot of amazing bars and clubs if your st enough to know where to look then stay here     oh and i almost forgot it is better than sleeping on the street 
P => A nice comfy stay We stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel on Saint Hubert Street in Montreal Quebec  This is located on a well travelled road and its back faces the bus terminal Parking is included although it is first come first served so if you want to travel downtown do it by foot or Metro  Otherwise its up and out of bed before  a m  if you end up parking on St  Hubert  You cant park on the street at that time due to the morning rush I have stayed at this hotel  times twice before when it was a previous name  We stayed in room  facing the street  Best to request that or you will end up facing the bus terminal  It can get a bit noisy as per past experiences We only stayed one night  The room was clean and comfortable  You have a table with chairs if you care to eat in your room  TV was a bit older but it worked fine and had a remote control  Lobby is nice with blegranite floors  We did not use the restaurant at this time so I cannot comment on it  Only a couple of minor issues  The carpeting needs to be redone in the hallways  I didnt find anything wrong with the rooms carpet  Also the lighting in the bathroom could be a bit stronger  Other than that a good value for the money   CDN is what we paid and you are in the heart of downtown Montreal  The Hotel is located just north of the Place Dupuis and St  Catherine Street  Will return again thanks for a pleasant and quiet stay 
P => refreshing change Their new  deposit policy        me off on check in but besides that I had an enjoyable stay  The staff seems more professional this year they actually know what theyre doing at the desk and speak both English and French for once The location was convenient as usual  I get off the Greyhound bus and straight into the Taj Mahal  The atmosphere at the hotel seems different with the new administration  The change is good 
P => Taj Mahal A Dive I am in full agreement with the previous reviewer of this property  What a dive I had originally made a reservation at the Lord Berri since my favorite hotel quotGouverneur Place Dupuis was sold out for the weekend  I arrive at the Lord Berri only to be told that the toilet in my room was broken and that there were no more rooms available  So they booked me at the Taj Mahal without my consent  I had no choice since it was one of the many festival weekends and accomodations were hard to come by  You know not to expect much from a hotel that is located behind the bus terminal  All I can say is this place is vintage s or and screams quotreation neededquot  Once you get used to the Gouv and its amenities this place is like a bad roadside motel with dark rooms shampoo et al in packets  The sad part is this dump still charged me   CD  Thankfully I was able to check into the Gouv the following day  Avoid Taj Mahal 
P => big change

P => Nice staff lousy air conditioning The hotel is located in a convenient suburban Montreal location near several highways  For the area it was a fair rate but the area is expensive in general  There were only a few people in the hotel so it was very quiet  The staff was very friendly and helpful The room upgraded quite nicely including a nice and clean bathroom  Plenty of TV channels in both French and English  The only problem was the air conditioning  The control is an old dial thermostat which I could deal with but the AC was not cold  I figured it would take a while to cool down but when I laid down to go to sleep I was a bit too warm for comfort  If I had realized earlier that the AC wasnt going to cool the room I would have called the desk to be moved but I was already settled in so I dealt with it  Luckily it was a cool night and there is a window that opens  I would have some doubts about staying here again for the simple fact that the air conditioning was not effective  
P => Comfortable We have been staying at the Comfort Inn for several years  While the place is showing wear it is still a pleasant place to stay outside of Montreal  The accommodations are adequate the price affordable  Taschereau Blvd  has many fine restaurants  Be aware that there is lots of traffic heading in and out of the city so avoid rush hours at all costs  There is a nearby bus with runs into the city  You need exact change for the ride  
P => AIRPLANE ENGINE IN THE ROOM This is my second time to stay in this hotel  Found holiday rate of approx CAD from Choice Hotel web iste  However upon check in I did not make reservation front desk staff claimed there is never any quotholiday ratequot and quoted eighty something  Fortunately a supervisor came by and I told him what I got from the website  After a few clicking on their own computer I was given the quotholiday ratequot although I was asked whether I am a CAA member which is not the condition of getting this quotholiday ratequot  I said I am not a CAA member but I normally can get their senior rate  He accepted and I finally get this quotholiday ratequot Room is average size but the heating system in my room is apparently not in order  It sound like an airplane engine each and every time when it is running  I did not bother to change room as I stayed only one night plus the fact that I found out this problm late at night after a very time consuming french dinner in the city 
P => 
P => Great Airport Hotel THis is a very trendy hotel located within the international departures of the Montreal Airport  CHeck in was wonderful and fast  The rooms were large and airy and the beds were absolutely divine  We were just staying for  hrs on a stop over to florida  I would highly recommend this to anyone needed to have a stop over in montreal or needing to catch an early morning flight Cons pay wireless internet  
P => Nice Hotel We stayed at the riott the weekend of y  to ust   We were in Montreal for a  day convention  This is a new well kept hotel  The rooms are of reasonable size and the beds are very comfortable  There are a variety of restaurants in the area of the hotel and highway access is close We had the buffet breakfast one day and it was good although a little expensive    Our  year old was  and she only ate part of a Belgium waffle  Over all a great hotel and we had a good time and a great price convention rate  We would stay there again  
P => Great place for park and fly Being a Holiday Inn member for years I was concerned of the number of bad reviews we read of their hotels near the Montreal Trudeau Airport  These are popular due to their park and fly options  We ided to try Courtyard by iott  What a pleasant surprise  The price for at two week park and fly including one night king room was  with tax  The hotel is clean and the room was great  Bathroom spotless and nice hand creams body lotion coffee maker  The bed is a comfort guarantee  Even though the room was on the freeway side the noise was non existent  Shuttle to and from the airport was free and the pick up and drop off very efficient  If you consider the cost of parking for two weeks you just cant go wrong  No the parking is not covered nor is it secured as it is just the hotel parking lot but that was not the issue for us  
P => Liked the Hotel Not the Location Very nice hotel with good staff comfortable bed nice or  The location in an industrial business park is not one for walking around and certainly not scenic  A bit complicated to get to from the highway  I could see it but couldnt get to it You have to use a service road  It had a nice restaurant and there are a few in walking distance  a grill and a McDonalds  Long way to downtown and the Old City  The front desk gave me directions to the Metro station and that was better than driving and paying for parking  Not walkable to the Metro though  Fortunately I had a car  I think tourists would be better off downtown  Kind of inconvenient  
P => Super amazing Stay for the airport cause its not downtown  Great hotel    close to airport but you cannot hear the planes go by at night Food is good but expensive Hotel quality is great service is great and close to airport Business services are great     computers downstairs and free printer Love it love it love itI paid  for the room  
P => Very Nice Affordable Brand New Stayed at the Montreal Montreal Airport for one night  The room was very clean with brand new furniture hotel is brand new  The front desk agent was very friendly and our check in was very fast  Very nice pool with salt water  Nice tub as well  Would defenetly recommend it and I will stay there again if going to Montreal  
P => Great rooms Had a one day training session so the company booked it for me  Brought the family over and extended it for one more day   total days  Didnt expect anything special as Ive never stayed in Courtyards  Usually Hojo types  Building looked bland so no big deal  Didnt expect anything anyway  But I was really tired from sitting beside my crying children anything with a roof would have been heaven  Wife drove because I havent slept but thats for another story   Imagine our surprise when the automatic doors opened and were greeted with a warm Bonjour from the front desk  Wow Great reception hall at least for its kind   priceline rated it at   stars   it should get at least a   for the reception hall Off to the rooms and noticed the halls are wide not like Vancouver hotels  which was a good thing because we had a double side by side stroller   opened the rooms  Wow very clean and well appointed rooms I thought wow we got this room for  What a        bargain Very clean very nice bathroom   loved the delta faucets  Wish I could get these for my house Our toddler immediately lit up and ran back and forth in the room   bounced up and down the bed  You dont know how much it was a relief to rest after  hours driving  With these kind of appointments my wife actually was able to take out the clothes and use the drawers   she never use them because she says theyre all quotickyquot   but here she was laying our clothes out nice and folded  Complaints Kids room in the basement is bland and nothing much in terms of activities there   well these are usually for business people so I cant really blame the hotel   also our room window is facing the highway   the noise is not much but its there and we hear some from the airport itselfOverall a great experience family loved it   walked to the Spheron and checked out a small bistro there   great beef paninis and soup 
P => Lovely but noisy  This is a relatively expensive hotel for an airport hotel  However it is lovely newly orated modern cosy  There is an airport shuttle bus which is fast and convenient and the driver was great  The bus trip comes complete with complimentary apples and water tooThe hotel itself is in quite a good location close to a small ish mall cinema and a number of restaurants which are all within walking distance  It is also possible to walk to a tube station but this might be a little too far for some about half and hours speed ch away The only problem that I have with this hotel is it is an airport hotel and close to a busy road and is therefore noisy  I am certainly not a light sleeper but would have been gald of a pair of earplugs for this one 
P => Comfortable Hotel close to access A wonderful stay room was very comfortable and clean  Only complaint was the wired internet connection in my room was on the slow side but my other coworkers who stayed there had no complaint so be it was just me  Staff spoke both English and French and were helpful  The restaurant served a great breakfast with made to order eggs bacon sausage and make your own Belgian waffles around  US  I liked that this was some distance  minutes from downtown as it and driving was more relaxed  East access to the  and the airport  No problems with the free airport shuttle  Across the street is a movie complex and several restaurants including the FireGrill restaurant    great food and service  
P => One of the best Courtyard Though the family stayed one night we had a wonderful time there  Building room bathroom washroom room or and etc were in excellent conditions  One of the best Courtyards I have stayed in so far Also though our view including the flight path for the airport kids loved it you still could not hear any jet noise even with the window slightly open Staff was helpful bilingual and greeted you with a smile Though I am not sure what the other hotels around the airport offer but I would recommend this facility to anybody needing accommodations near the airport However the only complaint I have is the parking situation due to its location  There is only a dozen parking spaces located out front and the main parking lot was at the opposite end from our room of the building  
P => Very nice hotel stay away from the airport shuttle I stayed at this hotel for one night  Its in a good location close to the airport with some shopping and restaurants within walking distance  The staff was nice and they spoke English and French  The room AC worked very well and the bathroom had great lighting and was extremely clean  No problems with the internet  I did experience significant problem getting picked up from the airport via the free shuttle  I had to call the hotel  times and waited over  minutes  No apology or explanation regarding the delay was given by the driver  My reaction to this situation was to forget leaving a tip for her  Overall Id stay here again  
P => Great Place  Fantastic Staff Fantastic place for business and family travel for anyone doing business in the area The rooms are well kept amp very very clean The staff go out of their way to enusre that your stay is comfortable amp convienient I have stayed at this hotel almost every week for the past  months and have never had a bad experience  
P => A Place To Stay We have stayed at this location about  times this year and everytime we stay there its always the ROYAL TREATMENT  The staff is great and very helpful  The location is super clean and location is close to everything  Ive spoken to the wonderful ladies at the front desk and have mentioned that we wont be able to come during the summer months but will return again after our busy season in the Eastern Townships  Its the place to stay  
P => Beautiful Very Up Scale Courtyard Hotel il     The Courtyard Montreal Airport hotel is a beautiful hotel  It is nicer than many of the full service riott hotels that I have stayed at in the past  Every aspect of the hotel exhibits a very high level of quality  Service is excellent The hotel is located adjacent to Canada  and between exits  and  close to the Montreal Trudeau airport  While we could see the hotel from the highway we had trouble finding it  We called the front desk and the associate helped us with directions immediately Arriving at the Courtyard check in was  riott fast  taking under a minute  Our group of three all received the King rooms as requested  The room rate was  Canadian using an available AAA rate My room was   was close to the elevator  The room was beautiful  The d cor and quality of the furnishings impressed me  The bed was firm but very comfortable  There were both feather and foam pillows and the quality and feel of the linens was excellent  Even though my room faced the freeway I did not hear any highway noise The room had a flat screen TV with a large variety of both Canadian and US channels  I was pleased to find the Lakers game on TNT even though they lost There was also a large selection of pay per view movies The work area was large and featured a two level desk  The bottom level could be pulled out to increase the desk area  There was a comfortable and functional office style chair and lighting was good  Electrical and broadband connections were conveniently located above the desk Across from the work area was a sofa and coffee table  The sofa was very comfortable  I did not check but believe that it was also a sofa bed  Heat and air conditioning was centrally located and quiet The hotel offers wired complimentary high speed internet service in rooms  The Data Valet service worked well  Running the Speakeasy internet speed test showed a download speed of K and upload at K  While the regular internet connection worked well it did not work as reliably with our company s VPN as most riott properties do  It took several minutes for Outlook to connect and it went on and off line several times in three hours  The bathroom was large and also orated nicely  The combination tub and shower had a great shower head and plenty of hot water which flowed immediately  There were enough thick white towels for four guests  It  be an unusual comment but the plumbing fixtures in the bathroom were very high quality Lighting was good and the granite vanity large  Bath amenities included shampoo conditioner and lotion One feature of the new design Courtyard rooms is the coffee bar area  It has a four cup coffee maker is well lit and has a granite counter top and a mini refrigerator under the counter A business associate and I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant  As part of the buffet there is an omelet station  The buffet was pretty standard having a good selection of both hot and cold items  The cost for two complete breakfasts was   Canadian  Service was prompt and excellent The Courtyard is connected to a Residence Inn something that I have not seen before  The two hotels share an indoor swimming pool large exercise room and large guest laundry on the lower level of the Courtyard  Next to the guest laundry was a children s play room with a window between the two Everyone at the hotel spoke excellent English all though their initial greeting was in French I really liked the Courtyard Montreal Airport hotel  It is a beautiful property with really excellent service  
P =>  on  For flavour but the rooms looked nice in the pamphlet card Too Bad  I like riott and the rewards plan was good but this hotelhas no real flavour  I felt like I was in a walt or a hospital waiting to check in  The local area is sorta in the middle of no where and a walk to he local submway was way too long and cold  I overpaid at nearly  and what is included  Nothing  I would upload a photo or two but I erased them in a rush to forget Montreal and this hotel in general  Some one tried to tell me its new  Why does it look like an office building that was changed into an apartment building  I am going to stay elsewhere next time I get stuck in Saint Larent  Sometimes its nice when a hotel has flavour and real amenities  Dont ask me about the pool  I almost hit my head on the ceiling  I am booking a days inn in Toronto next week and I think that I will be better off  At least the rate affords me free breakfast  Good luck in Montreal fellas  It was worth it still  NOT  
P => One of the best in chain RECOMMENDED  Always a fan of Courtyards for predictable quality  This    year old property does not disappoint  A modern multi story facility directly connected to the Suites hotel next door  or is modern  All facilities in excellent solid condition  Checkin fast n friendly  Room quiet despite location next to Trans Canada highway  Rooms well laid out with contemporary styling  Bedding exceptional  Bath area well illuminiated and with bit more style than old gen Courtyards  Easy highway access this is an industrial area downtown   minutes away  Overall   one of the best Courtyards in my experience  
P => Great hotel and wonderful staff We recently attended with our sports team to a tournament in Montreal  Everything was arranged by telephone and from the moment we got there the facilities and service were top notch The staff were friendly and knowledgable  The check in with a large group went very quick as the hotel was organized and were waiting for us  The staff were always available to help us out  They provided a free room to store our equipment  The rooms were excellent and the price was more than affordable  Travelling all over Canada to numerous tournaments and over the various years this would rate as the best hotel we have ever used  
P => Pefect accomodation for the area The previous reviewer gave an excellent detailed overview so not too much to add for description  This is definetely best suited if you have business in the area or are looking for an airport  min travel time hotel  If you are looking for city center then stay in the center Yes it is new I stayed in late    but I found the design finish and detail well above average  Staff were very friendly and helpful terrific rooms and I rate the gym well above average for this type of hotel all brand new best quality equipment  Only way to beat this would be a dedicated health club For an industrial type location it is nice to be able to walk  minutes to shops theatre and a variety of restaurants as I didnt have a car rented I could walk to our office Bonus to me was location large rooms free internet large bathroom with large towells and lots of shelves the great gym and a ent full breakfast available for a ent rate  I was on the north side and was very quiet  Missed a few more batroom amenities but that was minor  
P => New slightly upscale Courtyard but you probably need a car to downtown  The Courtyard Montreal Airport is a new above average Courtyard that nevertheless follows the formula set by this riott chain LOCATION About  minutes by Hotel van from the airport  to  minuntes by car to Centre Villedowntown depending on traffic  In the Northwest corner of Montreals St  Laurent neighborhood which affords some facilities in walking distance despite the industrial office park locationsee surrounding area below  The building is less distinctive looking than its pictureie  bland modern LOBBY High ceiling off white tile foor lighted panel photos of downtown and two attractive lounge areas all well lit give the lobby a clean attractive feeling with a slight touch of elegance  The restaurantnow breakfast and dinner a small barno license yet sit behind the main lounge and are more upscale than usually found at Courtyards Rooms Elevator floor landings are reminiscent of full service riotts hallways are bright with a multicolored modern carpet Rooms have deep blue carpeting with sperical silver design and some seafoam green and a muted version of this green is reflected in the wallpaper all and all quite attractive  Floor to ceiling sheer curtains backed by a blackout curtain and faux cherrywood furnishings round out the look  Bedding is the lastest in Courtyard beddinga welcome change white comforters with foot mufflers upscale linens  The beds are very firm but still have ent padding though I liked the memory foam laden beds in the new Courtyard in Hershey PA that I stayed in last ember a whole lot better  Rooms have an alcove with a small refridgerator and there is a flat screened but traditional TV  Rooms are a ent size but  rooms per floor have an extended length adding a sofa to both the two queen bedded rooms and the king bedded ones these rooms are spacious  Ceilings on the thtopfloor have  foot ceilings adding some spaciousness to even the traditional roomswe stayed over our  days in all three versions of the  queen bedded rooms  Bathrooms are a ent sizeif not large but are attractive with faux tile floors and faux green ble in a number of places  Bath amenities are stingy two small bars of soap and a container each of shampoo and conditioner  An in wall airheat unit with thermostat for each room  One room we stayed in had an unpleasant compressor noise from the AC the other two rooms were fine  Only windows on the north side of the building open  Muted sounds from the hallways was the only noise we heard Hotel Amenities There appears to be some room service  In the basement there is a ent sized heated pool and hot tub a small excersize room a childrens playroom and modern washers and dryers all shared with the attached Residence Inn as yet unopened when we were there  Off the lobby there is a card key entry room with five PCs and a printer and a bank of hook ups for your laptop in one of the lounges all free of charge There is a tiny store for snacks etc Surrounding Area None of it pretty but a block away is an entertainment complex with a very comfortable multi screen cinemashowing many American films upscale Italian SteakHouse and Chinese Buffet restaurants a downscale breakfast and snack bar and an Ok coffee house plus I believe some sort of nightclub  Across the street is McDonalds a chain family restaurant and a chain Sports Bar  There is a pizza place behind the complex  A small block further is a mid size indoor mall with  department stores  Our favorite place for breakfast Chez Coras was a  minute walk thru parking lots or ask the hotel van to take you  Chez Coras is Canadas IHOP but so much betterStaff Very pleasant not always knowledgable and trying to get the new hotel off to a good start which was sometimes confusing for them and their guests  We always got a warm Bonsoir when entering the lobby  And unlike other Courtyards there was a bellman on hand to help with luggage  No concierge There is no Courtyard and no outdoor space you would like to spend time in  One final warning driving in Montreal can be difficult  Signs are universally only in French despite the bi lingual billing of the city  
P => 
P => Hotels clean but due for reation The hotel is centrally located in downtown Montreal and its easily accessible to a lot of tourist attraction  Hotels clean and staffs are very friendly but its due badly for reation  It has no swimming pool either  
P => Good location good service but hotel could use updates Stayed here while taking my dhter on a trip to visit McGill university  It is a great location and the service staff was very helpful  Lobby is small elevator was broken and hallways were a bit shabby  
P => Wonderful as always Another one night stay but we wished it was longer  A lovely hotel   friendly and efficient staff and well equipped rooms  is very good  Now they have a resteraunt which serves good food and is no more expensive than most resteraunts in Quebec City  We have stayed here several times now and find its location   just inside Port St Jean   and amenities excellent  
P => manage your expectations I stayed  nights during e  Due to a good offer I chose this riott over the other one Chateau Champlain which I stayed last time  I didnt expect it to be at the high end but it is not too bad as it is an old building Surprisingly it is not noisy during day or night  The room is small and the bathroom is tiny too as expected but the desk is quite big  Everything is quite dated and worn  Even the pillows are over used  The air conditioner is super noisy so I had to turn it off in order to sleep  The internet is free and it pretty reliable  The only new thing in the room is the TV which is flat screen The only thing that really bothered me was finding someones hair on the bed and in the bathroom  I think is belongs to the maid The hotel offered buffet breakfast for   which includes coffee and juice but who can eat so much in the morning With all the hotels on that street including the brand new Holiday Inn and Hilton Garden Inn beside this hotel nobody will stay here if riott dont make some improvements  I was informed that the hotel will undergo major reations at the end of the year so I might consider this hotel again when it is all done  
P => Needs to be Updated The Pros   Really good location  Walking distance to many restaurants  Staff is very friendly and helpful  Cleaning crew was very thorough  The Cons   Rooms were small  D cor needs to be updated  I prefer white comforters as most of the riott Residence Inns have in all of their standard rooms  That way you know that the comforters are clean  Other than breakfast there is no dining in the hotel restaurant  
P => Extremely Disappointed The moment I saw that you had to drag your suitcase up a few steps to get to the elevator I should have know this hotel didnt take into consideration the comfort of their guests  I think in the U S  this would be a violation  Enough of that  I found the bed extremely hard  The heatingair conditioner unit was the old style jutting out from under the window  Noisy could never get the right temperatur  Its the type you find in a seedy motel  Ugh  I also found the rooms to be quite small compared to the Courtyard I had just been in Quebec  Also the midnight to morning clerk didnt understand English Now that is just the hotel which I chose so I cant blame them for this but the location was terrible  All the actionactivitytheaterresturants are closer toward the water  There is another riott closer to Notre Dame Basillica  Chose that one for location and you will be better off  
P => Best Stay Ever This Hotel was Excellent the moment i set foot in The lobby The staff is very respectful  there is also a bell boy who takes your stuff up to your room and we got a perfect rate  a night  the beds are the best and they even give you the choice of what pillow you want The hotel is pretty small about  rooms per floor but thats actually good so there is less noise the only complain i have is that the bathroom was a bit too small and that the valet parking is  bucks a night  either than that this hotel is perfect 
P => Consistent Mediocrity riott earns my business year in and year out I have been a Platinum status guest for over a ade  In general I view riott like McDonalds   they never serve quotthe bestquot but the product in this case lodging is predictable This property is amazing small only  roomsfloor and the staff is invisible   I never heard from or saw any staff members after check in which is very unusual  This property recently stopped charging for internet access welcome to the st century Their room rate is rather competitive and the location is hard to beat close to Schwartzs Deli Old City and Rue St  Denis I view this property as a place to sleep and not much more  Montreal is an awesome city and frankly unless youre ill theres not a good reason to spend much time in your room irrespective of where you stay As a romantic destination it didnt score a lot of points with my wife but Montreal itself certainly did  
P => Awesome City My partner amp I stayed at the Courtyard by riott hotel in Downtown Montreal in ch  Overall the hotel was pretty nice and very convenient as far as location goes  The hotel itself was a couple of blocks away from the subway station  We did the Breakfast buffet one time and it was pretty good with a nice selection of food  Tons of good local restaurants there We did not go hungry while there The room itself was very nice as it was two rooms and it reminded me of a boutique style hotel room  The view from the room was nice with a skyline view of the Downtown neighborhood  I wish I could rember the name of the Concierge as I found him to be extremely helpful and very polite to us  This was our first time travelling to Montreal and we both enjoyed it  The architecture amp history is awesome as was Notre Dame  We did the evening light show at Notre Dame and that was nice  
P => Good Hotel for Those on a Budget This place isnt as bad as all those reviews make it sound  Sure the bathroom amp room itself are small but for a  star hotel it cant be beat if youre on a budget PROS  Everything in the hotel is very clean    Beds amp pillows are comfy  Shower water pressure was great   Breakfast buffet was pretty good a little overpriced at   CAD for what you get however    LOCATION   this place is within walking distance of everything it was only about a   minute walk to the Latin Quarter which you must check out if youre staying a few nights    Rue St  Denis great restaurants amp bars and a  minute walk to Old Montreal  Staff were very helpful and spoke very good English check in and check out were a breeze  FREE WIRELESS INTERNET in all rooms Also coffee maker desk iron amp ironing board nice little hairdryer    all you need  Reasonable prices amp selection for room serviceCONS  Slightly small bathroom   Windows in the rooms did not open and so it always smelled a bit musty  The light in our bathroom took forever sometimes over a minute to come on which was a bit of a pain in the middle of the nightAll in all the hotel was ok and I would definitely consider staying there again the next time Im in Montreal    
P => OUTDATED Worst Bed In Montreal  Bulldoze it and Build A New One  
P => Great location below average room  Stayed at the Courtyard riott Downtown Montreal for Labor Day weekend  Room was below average  Heres the pros and consPros close to Metro Chinatown Latin Quarters McGill College Old Montreal Catherine Street Cons No safe no fridge very small  inch TV shower knob is FLOOR LEVEL so you have to bend over in the shower to adjust water coffeemaker in the bathroom      no mouthwash or toothpaste no free parking small rooms with low ceilings  
P => Small rooms good location The hotel is quite nicely located   near McGill University and Mont Royal  Old Montreal is a nice walk away  The room especially the bathroom was quite small and a bit old  The hotel only offers valet parking at about  a night  
P => The definition of Average I stayed here with a friend for  nights  It was clean and well kept  The location was good not great  There was nothing of note either good or bad  We were able to walk downhill to the train station  It wasnt that far and wasnt that close We took a cab there from the airport so I dont know about the parking  If you are looking for a clean reasonably priced no frills place to stay downtown I would recommend the Courtyard by riott 
P => Great Location Good Price I stayed here for  nights had a great time  The hotel was absolutely clean and nice the rooms were big and clean as well  When i had booked the room i had requested for certain things like extra towels pillows   etc   and to my surprise when i checked in my bed was full of pillows  Also i reached there way before the usual check in time but the staff was nice and didnt make a big deal  Location was great the metro and buses are easily accessible St  Catherine Street is just blocks away  Overall a great hotel just dont expect it to be one of the fancy kind  Definitely worth it if you dont want to spend too much on lodging  
P => Nice hotel great location We were lucky to get this hotel at the very last minute during Montreal Jazz Festival  We stayed for  nights at a pretty good value  The hotel is located down the street from McGill University and within walking distance of many great restaurants  Rooms were a little dated but were clean and very comfortable  The hotel offers free wireless internet which is always a plus  The staff was courteous although we had very little interaction with them once we checked in  The only problem we encountered was that one of the two guest elevators was out of order for the first couple of days  After it was fixed we didnt have to wait long to get an elevator  Overall a good value  
P => Great Good Location This is my second stay in this hotel  This time we stayed for  nights  The king sized bed was very comfortable  We love the great and varied breakfast spread each morning  There were cookies at the frontdesk in the afternoon which were yummy  On Sports night there were also snacks in the breakfast area  All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful from front desk to maintenance to cleaning etc  Would go back again  Thumbs up overall    
P => Great location Found an incredible deal through Quebecs tourism website and booked a  night stay at the riott  The site next door was under construction new Holiday Inn but there wasnt too much noise  Got a free room upgrade to a suite when I checked in nice surprise and really enjoyed having the extra sitting room and space  Nice gym on the top floor and the room was clean and comfortable  The location is perfect right on Sherbrooke very close to McGill about  min to the Musee des Beaux Arts and well within walking distance of Rue St  Laurent and Rue St  Catherine  
P => Good Value I stayed at the hotel on Memorial Day weekend for two nights  Its a standard riott hotel with the standard setup  We got a great deal by using the Sweetheart Deal check their website  The best parts of the hotel   good location   centrally located so you can walk everywhere or take the nearby metro if you need to    good value   check the website we got the nd night at   off The worst parts  There is construction going on on the buildings on both sides of the hotel  Wasnt really a big problem though    Tiny bathrooms  
P => riot Courtyard   Montreal The Montreal riot Courtyard has a excellent location in downtown Montreal  It is an older property and unlike the vast spaces that are expected the hotel has a no frills   straight to business   attitude about it  The reception at the left and the miniscule lobby leads to the lift  The rooms are large and well lit Wifi all over is a great asset for the business traveller  The beds are clean and comfortable  The management was prompt in sending up a fridge when requested  The coffee machine did not heat up the water The price was a bit on the higher side  At  per night it was certainly high  Would have been fair if it included breakfast Overall experience was average but given the location it was worth the price  Do look up the Tourisme Montreal site they have additional discounts and interesting gifts  
P => Great Location Service Iffy The property is in a great location on Sherbrooke and an easy walk downhill to the Bay and downtown shops and nightlife  The concern I have with the property is the iffy service  The check in process with the front desk is pretty painful  They dont really understand English very well which makes for a communication barrier from the very beginning  The front desk agent I had female tried to make the check in process so quick it seemed like a fast food counter  She really did not listen to my questions or my needs  When I later asked for directions to the airport I got the same vibe  The feeling you get is that they do not wish to speak to their customers If the property could fix its front desk accumen it would be a much better property  
P => Outdated but great staff This hotel is a little outdated  The wall paper and ceiling could use a fresh coat of paint  I visited a otel and really enjoyed the flat screen televisions on the wall  I think this was a good advantage compared to the televisions provided in the room  I found it to be too small even compared with Holiday Inns that I have stayed at  It is not that I stayed and watched television my entire stay but it was nice to have that option in the evenings before bed  The room felt cramped with the size of the furniture in the room However the staff at this hotel was absolutely wonderful and provided excellent tourist information  Kudos For the price and location this hotel was good  
P => Good location and price For the summer this was a good deal for the location  Theres limited parking however so you have to pay them to valet it  Theres a good size pool on the top floor with a good view and its walking distance to shopping and dining all around  The rooms felt like what we paid for as far as or and cleanliness  not really above average or anything  
P => Great Hotel We were on the th floor for  nights Fri Mon in mid t   Paid   room rate    Taxes amp service fees     CAD per night for  Queen beds plus complimentary continental breakfast  Room was clean spacious  Bed was comfortable  Concierge Simon was very helpful  You get a voucher to give to the waiter when you go for the Continental breakfast  The voucher includes gratuity so you do not have to tip at breakfast  Continental breakfast included the pastries muffins make your own waffle scrambled eggs bacon hash brown orange juice coffee etc  Beware of taxi drivers gouging you it only costs  flat rate to go from a downtown hotel to airport  The driver tried to overcharge us thinking we do not speak French  You do not need to know French in Montreal  Most people are bilingual including hotel staff  Hilton Garden Inn is being built right next to the hotel amp is slated for completion next year  We stayed on a weekend so there was no construction noise going on  Ask for a room on a higher floor if you want to minimize construction noise during weekdays  The only complaint about this hotel is that the bathroom was too small  There is enough counter space good water pressure but the size of the washroom was tiny  When the door is opened it covered half of the bathtub  Otherwise it is a great hotel  There is a computer in a small room in the lobby that has free internet access for guests Travelers Tip Just around the corner is rue St  Catherine where you can hang out or shop  Nightlife in Montreal is incredible  There are countless coffee shops one after another Visit St  Joh Cathedral  Admission is by donation  This grand cathedral is located on a hill  Theres limited or almost no parking in Vieux Montreal Old Montreal so take a taxi  Biodome was fun  Theres an animal zoo world for  seasons  Book a day trip to Quebec City by Grayline Tour     Its a  hour drive from Montreal on a big Greyhound bus  The tour guide gives a history about the city amp then you have time to wander on your own  It was great  
P => Location Location Location We stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend and enjoyed our stay  The hotel is not plush   limited amenities but the rooms are comfortable and clean  no view to speak of They have a barrestaurantpool and spa   all of which we were too busy enjoying Montreal to useThe Montreal tourism website advertised a Sweet Deal with a list of participating hotels  most of which told me they could not offer me the deal since it was limited    Finally the riott Courtyard was able to accomodate me The deal gave us a discounted rate for the first night and half price for every other night   and a bag of goodies on check in Nice pkg for a nice stay The Concierge was very helpful and the location is within a sshort walking distance of the Underground McGill and restaurant row  
P => Not my cup of tea I booked this hotel after reading the reviews  I definitely dont agree with a lot of them  Our room was tiny and the bathroom was dirty and really small  The hotel needs major reations  The staff were all very friendly and the location is great but with the dollar being so weak this hotel should have been much cheaper  I would not go back or recommend it to any of my friends  For a few dollars more we could have stayed in a much nicer and cleaner hotel  Also the elevators were quite dangerous cause they closed so fast and barely gave you enough time to get on and off  
P => Great location friendly staff This was a nice place to spend a weekend in downtown Montreal  The weather wasnt the greatest when we were there but the kids enjoyed to swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel  Nice views of the city from the th floor  The valet parking was efficient as long as they got their  minute warning the car was ready when you came down to the lobby  The staff were helpful and very courteous  The rooms were clean and quiet  The bath tub was starting to show its age but was clean  We didnt have problems with the construction next door as we were there on a weekend and no one was working The location was great for site seeing shopping and getting on the Metro to go wherever you wanted in the city  
P => Watch out for constructions Last week I stayed at the hotel for a week on business  Located conveniently to local shopping district within walking distance Saint Catherine ST Superket within one block distance  Close by college McGrill  Safe area with just some harmless homeless guys on streets  Staff is friendly all around from the maid to the valet parking attendant to the reception guys  Allow  min for valet parking to bring your car  Room was clean on the suite  Avoid the restaurant food is not expensive but not so great neither definitely not up to the riott standards  You can get better quality food outside at about the same price  One thing that was unavoidable is the construction of the new hotel right next door  If you are a light sleeper avoid at all cost  Hammering and banging from Monday to Friday  am to  pm  
P => Loved the location  This hotel is clean the rooms large and it is in a good location  You can walk one block to the train station  We bought a three day pass for the train and it was well worth it  The hotel people are very helpful for directions  You will pay    tax  REMEMBER The taxes here are very high and the dollar rate is almost even  I think we paid close to   in taxes for our hotel per day  
P => Great Location great service highly recommended We had a great stay for the night there is nothing bad to say about this hotel Location is fantastic close to the old Quebec town and walking distance of pretty mcuh everything The personnel was delightful the room to perfection My  year old dad did not even hear the thunder at night was he was sleeping so well Very nice and authentic  I recommend  
P => Nice Hotel  Will return We stayed at this hotel for three nights  There was a special rate of night so the pricing was fabulous  The room itself was nice  There were two double beds a night stand business desk dresser drawers and color TV  The beds were very comfortable and clean  White duvets are used as the linen and they were very comfortable  The business desk had ample space for a laptop and its own chair  The color TV was not that big be  in  and had English and French cable channels  The carpet was fine too  However the bathroom could have used a little touching up  It wasnt dirty but showing its age e g  a noticeable chip on the mirror As for the hotel itself it is centrally located in downtown Montreal  You can walk to Rue St  Catherines the Old Port and Chinatown  There are a few metro stops including the large McGill one nearby too  We used the valet parking day and walked or took the metro everywhere  The staff were all accommodating and bilingual  The lobby is not huge but it is well maintained  The business center only has one computer and it was usually occupied  Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again  HOWEVER there is major construction going on right next door to the hotel  The workers start early and finish late  Therefore if you are a light sleeper ask for a room facing Sherbrooke  But you still  be able to hear the work being done  The noise didnt really bother us but you will definitely be aware of the work going on  
P => Rooms outdated Was disappointed with the room  The room was dated with poor air quality The front desk front end help were very helpful This hotel is conviently located and within walking distance to many of the attractions etc I most likely with try another hotel before returning here  
P => Loved the riott Just returned from Montreal and a  night stay at this hotel  Location was excellent close to shopping and restaurants rooms clean and the staff was courteous helpful and very friendly  Had dinner and breakfast at the hotel restaurant   both meals were delicious  Would definitely stay there again  
P => Good hotel for business and pleasure Stayed here for work meeting  Staff was friendly and accommodating  Nice large space for meetings  Lunches were good too   each day we had three options to choose from plus salad bar  Location is perfect   lots to do in the area  Only blocks away from St  Laurent and St  Catherine Streets  Sleeping rooms were clean  
P => Outstanding Excellent hotel in perfect location  The room was clean comfortable and quiet  Staff members were courteous and pleasant without exception  No complaints at all  Id stay there again  
P => Just unlucky I guess       Everyone else seems to have had no problems here but my stay was a bit difficult  I arrived well after midnight and had expected from prior experience at Courtyard by riott properties to be able to grab a soda and some chips or crackers from the lobby store  When I finished check in and mentioned to the desk clerk that I was going to get a snack he informed me that the store was closed without offering any alternative suggestions or even an apology  Upon arriving in my room the first thing that greeted me was a letter on the desk from the general manager apologizing for the noise and inconvenience from the construction site next door explaining that the hotel had no control over this  Upon entering the bathroom I discovered that it was so small that the counter extended over the toilet so that the only way to sit on it was with my elbow on the counter and my leg under it with the edge of the counter in my ribs  The next morning I spent several minutes attempting to adjust the temperature in the shower  I finally got in anyway and discovered that the temperature continued to vary randomly by   degrees throughout even when I didnt touch the controls I didnt actually have a problem with noise from the construction but I did return to my room at the end of the work day the first day to find that housekeeping had missed making up my room The problem with the shower continued throughout my stay but otherwise things settled down after that  The room itself was acceptable    about what Id expected  Room service food from the Italian restaurant downstairs was at least average I probably wouldnt stay here again unless it were the only available option at a reasonable price    Ive been in several other hotels in downtown Montreal that were better at comparable or lower prices  
P => Clean Rooms   Excellent Service Sure it  look dated from the outside but inside this hotel has done a good job of keeping up with the times  I dont know what some people expect when they visit a hotel that isnt billed as quotluxury accomodationsquot but this is as good as it gets when youre traveling on a budget and are simply looking for a good quality hotel Ill break this down like I do with most of my reviews PARKINGValet parking was about day  We had no problems retrieving our vehicles upon request by simply giving the front desk a   minute lead time ROOMOn this occassion I was traveling with several friends and we rented more than one room  All the rooms were spacious well kept clean stocked and nicely furnished BEDSThe beds were clean and comfortable even with my often temperamental back  The sheets were of better quality than your average hotel and there were plenty of pillows NOISENothing unusual  Even as a light sleeper i was fine at this hotel FRONT DESKWith the medium size group we were traveling with we often had to communicate with the front desk  The staff was always very friendly helpful and accomodating  From calling cabs giving directions and recommendations to assisting us with our luggage and providing us with umbrellas on a particularly rainy morning these guys always came through for us It should also be noted here that there was NO issue at all with the fact that we were english speaking Americans in a french speaking Canadian hotel LOCATIONThe hotel was easy to find right up the street from McGill University in the middle of downtown walking distance to everything  We rarely had resort to using our vehicles to travel RESTAURANTIt looked nice but we never ate there so I cant comment STOREThe hotel store is nothing more than a few shelves of goods near the front desk  However there were several small shops bodegas and mini ts nearby GYMNever saw it so I cant comment POOLNever saw it so I cant comment INTERNETHi speed wireless internet was provided free of charge  We had no problems accessing or using it  
P => Met Expectations Stayed Saturday night at the Courtyard riott in Downtown Montreal  For my short stay it met all of my expectations  Pleasant staff nice size room especially for a large city safe clean and in a central location  A little dated but not bad and the  rooms that they advertise per floor does give it that boutique feel  I definitely wouldnt hesitate to stay here again when returning to Montreal  At night they have someone at the front checking for everyones room key before letting them go further  My only complaint is that they advertise free wireless in the room but I was unable to connect  When I called about it they advised me that the room only has wired access  They did offer to bring me a cable and also suggested the business center if I needed to go online  Although I would have liked to use my PDA to check emails in the room I like that they didnt stop at just saying no    and suggested alternatives  The subway is a few blocks away and an easy walk  From there Rue Crescent is only two stops down  Ran out of time and only got to drive through Old Montreal and take some pictures so really cant comment on how easy it is to reach via walking or subway  
P => Excellent service normal rooms My friends and I stayed here for New Years   It is surrounded by other major hotel chains Holiday Inn Four Points Quality Hotel etc  The restaurant is expensive and worse than the independent places outside or the Holiday Inn bar  The pool is standard hotel size with a rather small jacuzzi  That and the fitness center are located on the top floor giving you a great view of the city  It is unfortunate that they did not have a steam room to complete the amenities  You are  blocks from the Metro a  minute walk to the malls and about a  minute brisk walk to Crescent or an  cab ride the same for other historical sites  Even though Montreal was experiencing a warm period during our stay it was still too cold to walk there and tiring   especially after exploring around for a few hours during the day  This is an inconvenience  But the hotel is right near McGill and the park   which can be a very relaxing walk when its daylight out  The service at the hotel would probably be the best part  Everyone is courteous and prompt  There were no problems with the bill and anythign we asked to be sent up cups towels bottle openers were done so within  minutes of our request  The concierge was extremely helpful in making New Years reservations and storing our bags  Our request for an early check in was honored at noon versus their regular time of pm The rooms are clean and normal size as are the bathrooms  The TV can use some updating and the programming is limited not that it should matter  There was no safe in our room but we left our passports cameras and iPods when we went out and everything was in place when we got back  Bottom line I would recommend this hotel  
P => Better Than Springhill Suites I had a not great stay at Springhill Suites and bolted for this Courtyard  Good move  Much nicer and better run  Very efficient and friendly staff good services good price and the locations just off of the charming old montreal area theres LOTS right here chinatown within walking distance and St Laurent just a bit further  Even better if you have car   you can easily get anywhere from here Big big pool laps and clean jacuzzi on top floor with stupendous views  Good workout room  Friendly bartender  And I was upgraded to an extremely nice suite far largernicer than even the larger suites at Springhill Suites The big problem is parking  The valet must have to go miles to park your car   it consistently took  mins to recoup vehicle  Learn to call down to valet in advance from your room  
P => Just another hotel I agree with other reviewers who found that this hotel is ent but in need of reation  I got a reasonable rate for one night on the riott website and it was more reasonable than other hotels nearby which is why I stayed there  The location is excellent as it is near Rue St  Catherine metro stops and thequotville interieurequot  It is hardly luxurious the bathroom was so small that when I leaned over to dry off from the shower I hit my head on the door but all things considered it is acceptable in most respects  You get what you pay for so if price is in issueI do recommend it  
P => not luxury but nice we stayed at this hotel for  nights and it was  of us traveling  the rate for their suite was great so we booked  suits because we did not want to share rooms  they had only  suite per floor so we were in different floors which was not a problem  the staff were friendly and their duty manager karimi was a gentleman  the suite were really big and each had arate bedroom  the bathroom was nice and the livingroom was big too  the location of the hotel is wonderful and within walking distance to everywhere  Ivebeen to Montreal again and I think for the price this hotel is good  it is not a luxury property but clean and central location with nice staff  if you are looking for a better taste and a modern hotel you should try Loews Hotel Vogue which is wonderful with great location  Also you cant go wrong by staying at Ritz Carlton  
P => A Great Hotel My wife and I have stayed numerous times at this hotel  Its not as luxurious as the Omni but the rooms are large clean and the service is excellent  I would definetly recommend this hotel  
P => Will definitely go back We just came back from a  night stay and loved it As a family of four with two younger children ages  and  we booked the King mini suite to allow the grown ups some privacy which has a arate king size bedroom and an additional sofa in the living area  This is a relatively small hotel which we loved as it feels more personal and intimate without taking away from the quality of the services  The rooms were spacious and very clean  Location is GREAT   walking distance to everything  Service was absolutely great   very nice helpful staff eager to help  We often used their pool which is average size for a hotel in a city and very clean  We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so many great breakfast places around  We stay at quite a few hotels as a family and are quite picky about what we want for service and quality and this was absolutely a success  We also met quite a few families and couples at the hotel that have been returning guests and told us the same things  We are definitely going back 
P => We enjoyed this riot We just returned from a four night stay at this hotel and really enjoyed it  True this is not top of the line for riot so there is no chocolate on your pillow  We had a room on the th floor with a view of downtown Montreal  The best part of the room was the beds  They had high thread count linens a comfy duvet and five pillows on each bed  We slept well  There also was a comfortable chair with ottoman  perfect for reading the morning paper  There was a nearby floor lamp with a place to park your coffee cup  The ice machine was just outside our door but we never heard it run unless someone was getting ice so the noise lasted just a few seconds  The reception area was warm and inviting with ble floors and dark wood paneling  This area was orated with large photographs of Montreal taken in the th century  The staff was warm and friendly  On the th floor was an exercise room with five or six pieces of equipment  Next to it was a guest laundry with a newer washer and dryer  We used the swimming pool and the hot tub also on the th floor  That room had great views of Montreal and Mont Royal Park  The subway was around the corner and down the block  We enjoyed our stay  
P => Good hotel fair enough location The hotel is a good enough hotel if you can get it at a reasonable price  I got the breakfast included package at a good priceThe good points   Huge rooms bigger than most I have been in and I travel a lot  Free internet that works well   Nice breakfast  Location that is about  to  minutes walking to the main shopping and happening street Rue Peel The okay or  need improvement points  Staff is rarely smiling  The rom service happens very late in the day at around  pm or soSo all in all if you need a real big room in a location that is just about okay and walkable to most places this aint a bad choice

P => Good for a one night stay  Awarded this on Priceline  A Dorval Airport property  The first thing I look for once Ive gotten past basic safety cleanliness and or is the availability of a convenient electrical outlet for my laptop  This reated room fails the test    no electrical plug by the bed none along the wall beside the bed  Fortunately I brought an extension cord and was able to jerry rig some power from the electrical plug built in to the desk light  Im using it to write this review  The wireless internet signal is strong Im on the th floor and theres no sign in mumbo jumbo to go through The room is clean and functional but small  The bathroom is also quite small  Not what you usually associate with the Crowne Plaza brand  The only chair in the room is the desk chair    the room is probably too small for an easy chair so its not great for curling up with a book or watching TV from a comfortable chair  For those of you bringing your earthly treasures theres an in room safe  There also appears to be a locked honor bar  And theres a bottle of something on the bed  Inspection reveals that it is a bottle of linen mist presumably for inducing some kind of aromatherapeutic state prior to slumber The carpets in the hallway are a strangely disturbing red grey combo with some circley things along one side only  Do not attempt to navigate the hallway while intoxicated or on strong medications  Perhaps the in room linen mist helps overcome the disorientation caused by walking the hallway In the elevator waiting area theres a blast of air from a vent in the wall that easily equals the ones used to dry a car in a car wash  I mean the artificial tree is swaying in the breeze and the pages of the top newspaper in the pile of newspapers are blowing Thats about it  Theres a flat screen TV on the wall you can use it to watch the Canadian curling championships  
P => Good hotel for a one night stay As far as Crowne Plazas go this is not one of their best properties however it is a good hotel if you need to stay close to the Montreal airport for a night or two This hotel was previously the Sheraton Four Points and it looks like Crowne Plaza refurbished the hotel as best they could but it really isnt up to the usual Crowne Plaza property standards  To be honest there are parts of the hotel that remind me of a motor inn or motel I was in Montreal for business and needed to spend one night close to the airport  When I got into my room I immediately went to set up my laptop so I could catch up on some work  I noticied that there was no internet cable on the desk and I had forgotten mine so I called down to the front desk to ask if they had a cable that I could borrow or quotrentquot  I was advised that they did not have any cables and that the hotel did not even offer in room internet service  I asked if the business centre was open but was told that it was closed due to construction  I think the front desk clerk could hear the stress in my voice so she offered me the use of one of their back office PCs  I needed to get some work done so I gladly accepted When I went down to the lobby I was quickly escorted into the back offices and allowed to use one of their computers  The clerk apologized for the lack of internet in the room and asked me if everything else was okay with the room  I thought that was very nice of her  There was another employee who heard me talking with the front desk clerk and also apologized for the inconvenience  At that time I was advised that there was a functioning PC in the business centre and that I could use it if I wanted to  Again I thought that the offer was very kind  This same employee asked if she could get me anything to drink and I eventually accepted a bottle of water  Again very thoughtful and a nice touch  Turns out that this other employee was the hotels General Manager The GM told me that the entire hotel is hooked up for wi fi so if youve got that on your laptop then youre good to go I really didnt use a lot of the hotels facilities however the breakfast buffet was of poor quality and if you can avoid it and grab a bite somewhere else it will be worth it  Theres not much around the hotel in the way of breakfast restaurants so you  have to eat at the hotel The service in the hotel was good and some of the staff remembered me from a previous trip  
P => Reated Luxurious bargain The Sheraton four points has recently re branded and reated as the Crown Plaza  The improvements are really nice  The pool still has the long slide for the kids  The rooms now feature nice modern bedding and pillows and flat screen TVs  Recommended  
P => A functional hotel convenient for the airport This hotel is good from a functional point of view   ie if you need to be close to Montreal airport  It is located in the middle of a cultural desert surrounded by major roads and warehouse parks so the guy who found it perfect for a Valentines Day stay obviously didnt get out of the room much The refurbished rooms are nice bathrooms a bit small  The unrefurbished restaurant is well past its sell by date  If you want to use their wireless internet ask for a room on a lower floor   the signal is very weak on floor   Worth phoning to negotiate a room rate   a guy came in off the street while I was waiting in the lobby and agreed a rate far lower than my internet rate from the hotels website which was cheaper than any of the other cheap agencies  
P => Very Nice My Girlfriend and I booked a POINTS stay at this Crowne for what we hoped would be a nice Valentines Getaway  The rebovated rooms on the Priority club level were perfect for this stay  The Flat screen tv worked as expected everyone has flat screens now so it was kind of expected  The lighting was wonderful with reading lights on each side of the bed  The staff was wonderful very friendly and always helpful The only down side to our stay was the lack of snack machines on any floor I looked on  and the ice machine being only on the odd numbered rooms  
P => 
P => Tres Bien   Great Hotel To be honest when I initially booked this trip on Hot Wire I was disappointed  Im used to staying in  and  star hotels when I book with Hot Wire so when I was left having to stay in the Days Hotel on Guy St  you would have sworn someone told me I was going to have to stay quotunder a porch held up by sticksquot  Im a hotel snob now   what can I say  Some of the reviews of this hotel   left me wondering   what am I getting myself into for  days  Let me start by saying looks are eiving  The outside and certainly the picture that is online are less than complimentary to whats inside   it makes it look very dated  When I arrived at check in    everyone was very very nice and I breathed a sigh of relief after seeing the main lobby  It was much more modern and well taken care of than the posts that Ive read  We had a room on the th floor and it was really nice  Dont get wrong there were no robes slippers fridge mini bar or Free Breakfast but it was really nice  The or was simple but yet inviting  There were no rugs   it was hardwood floors and the AC worked fine and didnt leak   like I expected it to after reading reviews  It was spotlessly clean nicely orated flat screen TV computer that I never quite figured out how to use   but on the nd flr  there are computers and printers and its in a great spot if you like the downtown area  After seeing Old Montreal I was partial to that neck of the woods but if staying in Downtown Montreal in the future   I would book the Days Hotel  They also have a mini store spas a small gym and a nice size outdoor pool on site Its  a day to park in their underground parkade   doesnt seem like much if youve ever parked in NYC for the evening  I have yet to check my credit card bill but I hope that it will reflect the price on the receipt that I received  If not then Ill have a problem probably more so with the bank and their foreign exchange fees than the hotel  Cash is king as they say This hotel is a block away from St  Catherine St  and a very short walk to the subway  Once you learn the subway system you can go anywhere  We visited Old Montreal Mont Royal go to the Tam Tam Festival on Sunday afternoons   its a free festival where drummers come from everywhere and just stage an impromtu concert Jean Talon ket where the locals shop and Olympic Park  So yes Im giving this hotel a thumbs up  
P => Standard hotel close to Bell Centre I stayed at this hotel in ober   Standard hotel in good location  Large rooms with dated d cor  ServiceGood service RoomsVery large rooms and clean bathrooms  The d cor is dated but really not important and the location makes up for it  No fridge but they have an ice machine Location Great location two blocks from the Metro and the Bell Centre two minute walk to restaurant and bar district five minute walk to St  Catherine Street shopping  Other restaurants and convenience stores across the street  
P => Great Location Nice Room really wet floors Myself and a friend stayed in the hotel for  nights as we came down from Ottawa for Canada Day  Now we chose this hotel due to it was the cheapest as I think most dont come down Canada Day in Montreal as we paid about  per night and  a day in parking which is a steal in downtown Montreal The locationGuy St is solid as it is about a block from St Catherines which is the main street in the downtown core  It is very close and about the same distance from the Bell Center if going for events  The rooms are pretty large and pretty clean with  double beds as we stayed in room  which we felt like we were the only ones on the floor as it was dead quiet all the time in the hotel which it can feel erie  The rooms are good sizes as in if you wanted to lay out a cotair mattress for a rd person to save some coin  The linens are standard and the bathroom is the same as a usual hotel bathroom which is not big enough for us larger fellows  The other neat thing is rooms come with PCs for use but it seems ours didnt work and no instructions on how to use  We just figured it was broken and moved on I gave it such a low rating due to the fact the stone age AC unit drips water on the floor which soaks it  I really mean it is crazy how wet and annoying if walking around in bare or socked feet  Also if anybody knows anything about carpets getting wet and drying all the time is ripe for mold which is something I would feel nobody wants to endure  I also came down with a fever after returning home but I wont blame that on the hotel but take that as you wish  Also the parking stairwell is like a dungeon which made us lh  
P => Going in blind I recently booked  rooms for my family and  other familes on one of those sites where you pay prior to finding out what hotel you end up in  Big mistake To be fair the hotel was convienently located and some aspects of the hotel were ok  Thats where it ends    I booked  quotnon smokingquot rooms however one room reeked of smoke and we couldnt change the room  All rooms had badly stained carpets and chairs and my room actually had a section of buckled ceiling and chunks of wood missing out of the furniture  This place looked like a abused frat room  Not surprisingly both Fri  Sat night there was a lot of drunken yelling and slamming of doors all night to the point were one of the guests open his door and told them to   amp  keep it down  I did call the front desk at  am to see if someone could come up which they eventually did  Ironically earlier in the day the life guard at the pool told some kids not to yell too much because it might disturb the people in the rooms above this was in the afternoon Seems kids cant make noise during the day but its alright for drunken patrons to yell and scream all night  Oh yes I did see a security guard in the lobby       just wondering where we went at night 
P => Location was the selling point for me    Ive stayed at this Days Inn on  arate occasions  amp     For me the appeal of this place is the location    Its about a block away from the Centre Bell and intersects with Ste Catherine right in the heart of downtown  As far as the hotel is concerned its OK at best  Cheap priced back then   it was only around  CAD AAA rate per night  The rooms were clean and big enough to fit  guys   beds amp floor space The garage has enough room to move around in  The one down side that as stuck in my head over the years was the staff was a bit on the stuck up side and they also had a guy posted in all the halls quotshhh ingquot you if you were talking at night    Not even loud making noise type talking    But just simple conversation while walking down the hall got a quotshhhquot which really rubbed me the wrong way All in all its a  outta  hotel but the good location bumps it up to a     
P => nice place OK its a Days Inn not the Radison  However I was more than impressed during my stay at this hotel  It was very clean especially the bathroom quiet roomy friendly and in a fantastic location  The staff was very helpful with directions and suggestions  The quality for the price cant be beat we paid  per night for a comfortable king sized bed  There was a computer in the room and while we couldnt get it to work we could plug in the ethernet cord into my laptop and get internet  Its less than a block away from the Guy Concordia metro stop right around the corner from St  Catherines street and has a Tim Hortons and Starbucks down the street  Downsides no pool well its outdoors no continental breakfast dont waste your money at the buffet in the restaurant downstairs no pay per view computer didnt work  Upsides clean large rooms friendly staff unbeatable location fantastic price in room internet access if you bring your laptop  I would definitely stay there again 
P => Bad Management possible stolen property I stayed at that hotel last Saturday and I forgot to take my laptop wireless mouse when I packed and checked out  I called the hotel the same day when I found out that it was missing and the lady I spoke to at the front desk told me that house keeping found it and asked me for my contact info that I gave because they didn t have it booking via expedia so that they can ship it back to me no problem I was assured that this will be shipped back and also someone will be contact me ASAP  Six days later I called for an update and I was told that they dont know anything about that and the person who is responsible is away and the office is locked  You draw your own conclusions  It is only a  however first I would like to alert this community about bad service bad management and the possibly the hotel staff lying to me and second alert the hotel management this incident and lack of cooperation can get escalated to that point that there are going to be employees of the hotel who  have to answer to accountability issues to the head office  I am planning to stop by in person at the hotel soon where at that point the mouse is going to be returned to me or a police report will be filled at the police station across the street for withholding property that belongs to me  It is nice that the internet exists otherwise we would still be at the mercy of incompetent people like the management of that hotel  
P => Good location polite staff I stayed at this Days Inn location in ust of  for a three day weekend while I attended the Champ Car Grand Prix of Montreal  The room was clean and acceptable for the price  The front desk staff were always polite and helpful  The location is great   walking distance to St  Catherine Street and the downtown nightlife  Two metro stops and the Belle Centre are a quick walk around the corner  Cabs to the airport are readily available for a flat rate  Drinks in the bar are overpriced but thats typical  
P => nice and good location our room was very spacious we couldve done cart wheels and we had a ent view of the city from the th floor and a big tv  it was within walking distance of the interesting downtown areas St  Catherines amp Crescent  it was nice that they had a quotbusiness centerquot where anyone could use the computers for internet but the connection was very slow and many sites could not be accessed webpages using https such as gmail hotmail and even the hotels own reservation webpage but yahoo mail works  They also have wireless that you can use in there but there were no empty tables just couches for you to put your notebook on your lap  
P => Not too shabby  For a couple in their twenties I thought this hotel was great  This hotel is only a block away from the cafes and shops on Saint Catherine street walking distance to resteraunts and it has a pool small workout room and a barresteraunt  I found them to be very helpful finding us taxis to the casino and giving us directions to old Montreal  The hotel itself had spaciuos rooms and great Air conditioning  Ive already made plans to stay there again However theres not much in the way of entertaining children besides the pool and it is on the main drag where children should not walk alone but it is in a very safe neighborhood   
P => Good deal     cheap and cheerful The hotel is in a great location and is cheap and cheerful  The rooms were a fair size and the beds and linens were clean and comfortable  There are a lot of younger people staying here but what else can you expect in a hotel so close to Crescent St We enjoyed our stay and will stay there again  
P => Not the best place   Great location but not the best accomodations  During the weekend it seemed like we were in a frat house with LOUD annoying drunk guests running up and down the hall all hours of the night  And the chambermaids paid NO HEED to the Do Not Disturb sign we left on the door  
P => Not worth the money Made a last minute reservation here as nothing else in our preferred neighborhoods and price was available  Weve been in much nicer places in Montreal for much less money and wouldnt stay here again despite the convenient location  The room was slightly dingy and the other loud guests were all too audible in the wee hours  If you can get into a bampb stay in it instead 
P =>

P => close to all amenities I just got back from  days in Montreal was my first time there and I tell you I want to move there  Days Inn is right down the street from Old MOntreal you cant beat it  Im glad I chose this hotel for its location I cant beleive that it was only a  min walk  The staff were so friendly Im glad that I dont take some of these reveiws to heart I would not end up going anywhere  I dont speak french but ppl in the city and the hotel were more than accomodating  The staff in the resturant were so friendly room service was prompt  Food delicious  I had the room that has the sofa  I didnt need it but for the same amount of money it gave me space to move around  It has a fridge so I was able to store drinks and yogurts for my morning routine  It was inexpensive freed up my bank account for other things lol  shopping All in all I will go back  If you want bells and whistles frou frou than go to the Ritz if youwant a place to hang your hat and rest your head and be close to Old Montreal this is your place  
P => Great hotel good service good location Id stayed at the Days Inn in NYC so thought it would be a safe bet in a city I hadnt been to before Its quite a new build so spotlessly clean  The service was great   whatever you need just ask  Nothing is too much trouble Location is good too  block from St Catherines and about  mins to the main underground shops   mins to old Montreal too and  mins to China Town  Also  mins walk to Bus station or about  in cab All good 
P => Visit of physicians congress Good situation by chinatown and old french town near from downtown  
P => Great Stay at a Reasonable Price This was our second stay at the Days Inn on Rene Levesque and better than the first  The staff were professional and the room quite clean  This hotel is well situated being very close to the winding streets and museums of Old Montreal  It is also close to St  DenisUQAMLatin Quartier and is just a ten minute walk give or take from the Museum of Contemporary Art and shopping areas on St  Catherine  If you want a very busy tourist area to be right at your doorstep choose another hotel but if you dont mind a brief walk in this beautiful very walkable city and you want to save money this is a great place to stay  The restaurant attached is pretty good and all of the staff both in the hotel and the resto were friendly and helpful  We will stay here again for sure  
P => Good stay but location isnt the best Stayed at the Days Inn Montreal while visiting the city to watch a couple of Habs games  It was our first time in the city so we didn t know what to expect in terms of getting around the city  We knew the hotel was a fair distance from the Bell Centredowntown but booked anyway mostly due to price The hotel was clean and staff friendly upon arrival and throughout our stay  They assisted us with questions regarding directions and local sights  The rooms were average nothing spectacular but we had stayed in a few Days Inns over the years and didnt expect luxury  Rooms werent noisy and elevators were good  The hotel is located about a  minute walk from the Metro which will quickly take you to the Bell Centre and downtown shopping  We found there were also lots of taxis as well  Old Montreal was about a   minute walk and China Town was about  minutes  Lots to see and do in both places Biggest drawback is the location with limited restaurants close by  We walked from the metro after games to the hotel and felt safe  Restaurant in lobby was good and we ordered room service as well which was great  
P => Essence of Montreal I never write reviews for hotels because they all seem the same to me  Some are more grand than others but the service is always the same old plastic experience  This Days Inn deserves praise not because its building is unique nor does it have any more amenities than others it was cleaner than other hotels Ive stayed at the or in better taste and the little restaurantbar had a lovely little outdoor sidewalk terrace but I still wouldnt have taken the time to write about it  Im writing about this one because of the people inside her that made my visit to Montreal extraordinary  The Days Inn Downtown Montreal is in a great location with easy access to everything very clean with pleasant or exceptional service at an affordable price   and thats just in the lobby  On this short trip I made no reservation and just spontaneously left home for Montreal with my  teenagers  Check in was unusually efficient and we quickly found ourselves in a pleasant room  The day after I arrived an unforeseen personal problem came up and didn t know where to turn for help  Now I m no stranger to hotels  I ve traveled throughout the US Canada and Europe  I was a Hotel Admin major in college  I ve worked in small and very large hotels I know what they normally will and will not do for a guest  I imagined the manager here to be just another corporate suit like all others with a smile and a policy reason not to deviate from the normal but I was very wrong  Through my little crisis I discovered Oliver Michaud   Directeur de la Reception of the Days Inn  It was not his responsibility to help me  It was entirely my problem  Regardless he went far out of his way to help me find an intelligent solution and to ensure that our trip to Montreal was comfortable stress free and thoroughly enjoyable  Frankly I was shocked  I didn t think this caliber of hotel service still existed anywhere Additionally the efficiency of the front desk staff thanks Simon the non intrusive housekeeping staff the delicious food and friendly service from the team at the attached Allegro Restaurant thanks Jeff and Joyce and Mr  Ip the hotel owner  all helped to make our visit to Montreal go from being a potential disaster to one of the most enjoyable  I m so lucky I got a quick  day vacation this year and I happened to randomly wander into the caring arms of a hotel whose people made me feel I d found good friends rather than just visited another chain hotel somewhere in the world  What a pleasant surpriseTIME  daysHOTEL The Days Inn lobby was very clean and or very well chosen in good taste  Check in was quick and easy with an efficient and friendly staff The indoor parking was full so like other Trip Advisor reviewers I too had to park behind the hotel at the cost of  CAN   much less expensive than other hotelscities Boston    USD per night  The parking lot is shared with the police department next door but even so when in a big city it s common sense to remove valuables from your car  Don t be stupid Our room  was clean  Q beds  no bed bugs found even in the best of hotels in New York or Boston and again nicely chosen fabric d cor tv small fridge desk with a chair free wireless internet ask the front desk for the smtp info phone   I think they still charge   for outside calls from the room but there are  pay phones in the lobby near the elevators a small comfy chair a really nice iron a view of the rue Hotel de Ville   including the sunset off to the right and of course a clean bathroom en suite with perfect water presssure and waterpik showerhead  The room was smallish but not uncomfortably small  Unfortunately the windows dont open to get some fresh air yes the air in Montreal is fresh but the air conditioner did a very good job at keeping the air fresh and the temperature comfortable  There is no smoking in the hotel but you can enjoy some coffee or a cocktail with or without a cigarette on the Allegro s open air terrace and since the hotel is relatively compact getting outside is quick and easy with no reason to stink up the room youre going to sleep in with a stale cigarette smell  In fact it was something I noticed immediately upon entering my room   that it didnt smell hotel ish or like cigarettes or anything at all  It just smelled clean and nice  RESTAURANT The next morning we had a delicious breakfast of eggs fruit crepes and the always tasty bacon on the open air terrace of Allegro which is withinattached to the hotel  They also offer a breakfast buffet in the hotel for under  CAN but we wanted to eat outside  At Allegro amp Days Inn they keep the sidewalk and street area clean and the little tables amp chairs make a very pleasant place to sit and eat while watching people go by on foot on bicycles scooters and cars  Jeff and Joyce attended to us and both offered very pleasant service making sure that our experience was enjoyable with no pressure at all  Allegro serves all meals and cocktails so I imagine it would have been nice to sit and enjoy an evening cocktail on the terrace as well but I didnt make the time to do so LOCATION This Days Inn sits on the corner of boulevard Ren  L vesque Est and rue H tel de ville  It has easy access to many places Im sure but I only went to  places as noted below due to time constraints  I saw no unsavory activity and felt safe to walk everywhere in the area with my children  Old Town Vieux Montreal From the inns front door you can walk directly across the rue road Rene Levesque onto the rue Hotel de Ville and it is a  minute safe beeline walk down to the Old Town Montreal Vieux Montreal  Rue Hotel de Ville leads directly up to the steps of City Hall   which sports some lovely architecture and a pleasant fountain at the top plaza area then directly across the street is Jacques Cartier Pl at the center of all the old town with all its artists unique shops and restaurants  Explore  Vieux Montreal is charming  I would urge you to walk across the rue de Commune and onto the promenade too  There is a lovely view of the city from the park at night  You really cant go wrong by visiting this section of Montreal  Chinatown If you walk out the front door of the Days Inn and take a right across the rue Hotel de Ville you are only  street away from the Chinatown area which looked interesting but didnt get to explore it or any other locations due to time constraints  Traffic was very moderate and the streets well ked so with a map of the area and a little advice from Simon and Oliver at the front desk we got around very easily  There is also a bus stop right outside the front door for easy access to everywhere in the beautiful city of Montreal FRENCH Don t be intimidated  All the rumors about ill tempered French speaking people in Quebec are not true in Montreal  Everyone and I mean EVERYONE we met in Montreal who spoke French as their first language were exceedingly kind about speaking in English to help a stranger with their smiles and hearts sincere  People create the essence of any community regardless of lovely architecture and historic importance  Montreal is interesting and pretty to look at but it is the people of Montreal that make her so stunningly beautiful  
P => Average hotel stay Average hotel in a good location for touring Montreal  No continental breakfast  Rooms are small but clean  Nothing special here but a good base for exploring the city  
P => FANTASTIC Great valueGot the Queen Superior suite comes with one queen sized bed and tv a living room with couch and chair and a tv has a mini fridge and microwave wireless internet in the room no breakfast clean bathroom all for  This hotel is located close to downtown Montreal underground parking or outdoor parking be careful the outdoor lot gets full at night and you will get a ticket if you dont park in the desginated area   although the hotel will take care of the ticket for youGreat service look for Eric the supervisor he was always willing to provide me with detailed instructions to Montreal attractions he also recommended a great restaurant down the street Great service and definitely great value just mention that youre a CAA member and you should be able to get a discount House keeping was good  
P => Good clean hotel in central location A friend and I stayed for one night at this hotel while visiting Montreal during the Jazz Festival It was conveniently located within  minutes walk of downtown where all the shops restaurants and jazz festival shows were  The hotel was flexible with check in times initially we requested an earlier check in than pm but called to say we would arrive late  We arrived very late at night and the receptionist was kind enough to extend our check out time to pm instead of pm the next day Our short visit meant we didnt get a chance to check out the facilities of the hotel but the room was very spacious comfortable and quiet with a clean bathroom  We were able to leave luggage at the hotel while we saw the city the next day I would stay here again   very good for a  star hotel and cheap and spacious compared to what I am used to in Europe  
P => Barely adequate accomadations We stayed at this hotel for a bachelor party weekend  We got a very good price thanks to some vouchers we got at a travel site for referals  Without the vouchers the rooms were around nt  Parking was cheap  for outdoor for indoor  There is an onsite restaruant that serves a good cheap breakfast and has outdoor seating on a tiny patio Location was excellent for our needs which was bar hopping and girlwatching The rooms were quite small but otherwise standard  Our shower was dirty   pubes in there  Gave it a rinse and used it anyway but I know the more squemesh  have gone ballistic  Beds were adequate bedding was adequate though of course seeing pubes makes you wonder if they are really clean  Plastic cups instead of glasses  Air conditioniing was vey loud  View was a white brick wall  Ask for an even numbered room Very basic accomadation but fine for a weekend of drinking with the boys  I wouldnt go there for a romantic getaway or with kids  
P => Great location to the Old Port This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel we found the rooms clean and tidy on returning from our days out  Loved the bar  restaurant we ate there most days in the evening had supper and a beer Sam the bar tender made us very welcome and was always ready to serve  We will be back there on our next visit Its is located very close to The Old Port and just a few minutes to the Metro station Champ De s Thanks for a great stay  
P => Terrible service I usually stay at the Hotel Place dArmes but I ided to save  and booked one night at the Days Inn I arrived with my wife around  PM and had hard times finding a spot to park my car while I checked in as the hotel is on a busy street Rene Levesque I had to wait a good  minutes before anyone acknowledged my presence although I was the only client  I showed my Expedia reservations and was handed over the keys and shown the direction to the elevator without being offered any assistance with the luggage which were still in the double parked car with the flashers on  When I asked for Parking they charged me  and directed me to an external public parking which was  blocks away    and still no mention of any assistance with my luggage although there was a blizzard outside I parked the car on a plaque of ice as it was the only spot available walked back to the hotel and helped myself with the luggage When I came back late at night it took me  minutes to park my car as the parking was full and the only alternative was to park in another spot which was reserved for the police station    at least the car was safe I will refrain from criticizing the room cleanliness comfort of bed noise etc    as its consistent with the low price I paid  However I will never go to this hotel again as I have never imagined to be so poorly serviced  
P => If you are looking for a very very basic hotel go here This hotel is fine if you are looking for something to sleep in and nothing more  The rooms are dated and service is uneventful  With all of the wonderful hotels in Montreal that you could choose from I would suggest paying a bit more and staying somewhere else 
P => Used to be a great value now just average    About   years ago this place was newly remodeled and was a great value  Most of the furnishings were new the beds were ent and the location couldnt be beat  Then they stopped putting any money into the hotel whatsoever it seems  Each time Ive been since about twice per year the place has gone downhill a bit  Everything is looking very tired even the linens  Bath towels are very very small and thin  Blankets look a bit sketchy  The place overall is still clean but you can tell it just hasnt been kept up that well and is in need of a refresh  Ive since found that for the same price you can usually find much better accomodations at one of the larger  or even  star hotels in the area if you really look around  Ive since started staying at the riott or the Fairmont which Ive gotten for the same or be slightly more money  The staff is hit or miss  Once they gave us basically a free extra night because our flight was cancelled and we had to take a redeye that got us in at am instead of the following morning and they let us check into our room at that time Other times theyve been short a surley  At this point I dont think I would recommend this place with the other reasonable options around except be young kids who wouldnt care  
P => Cheap  The hotel is in a convienent location only a couple of blocks from Old Montreal amp Sherbrook Street shopping however its an extremely dodgy neighbourhood  The lobby and guest rooms are outdated but are overall pretty clean  The staff are quite nice  The underground parking smells awful and so will your car when you leave  I wouldnt stay here again but it didnt ruin my trip either  
P => Excellent location  Excellent location just over two blocks to Old Town and a few more blocks to ChinaTown  Public bus stops in front of hotel for easy access to downtown  Room was big and clean  No place to sit other than on bed usually have table and chairs  Restaurant had good selection and prices  GREAT experience  
P => Good Location We stayed Columbus Day Weekend at this hotel  It is a good hotel for a short stay  I think the location is good within walking distance to Old Montreal Chinatown Latin Section and the underground mall  For the price I would stay there again  
P => Good location but If you are non smoking think about it Good location near Sta  Catarina av   But I had dsome problems with my roomI travelled with my husband and my mom  We booked  rooms for  nights  Upon arrival we were placed in  smoking rooms when we had asked for non smoking  The windows did not open in the room and the smell of smoke was terrible  
P => Not the best location but it will do I guess Im writing probably the newest review of the Days Inn Montreal Downtown that anyone here for the New Year of   I have to say that this place is really ent   service was excellent cleanliness was a great plus but there was one problem for me here  Location  Despite being on a huge throughfare Rene Levesque the location was horrible in terms of being near a Metro station Champ De s  Despite what everyone says about being close to Berri UQAM and Champ De s Metro the walk down Rene Levesque is a bit of a hike and to Champ De s the walk is a bit sketchy  Mind you I was walking from Champ De s to the hotel at arond  PM and I had to turn around to see who was behind me depsite being from New York City  Dont get me wrong Montreal is a great place to be in and I absolutely love it but the area around here is a bit sketchy at best  Overall Days Inn Montreal is a great place to stay in for the price that I got at   a night  So when I go back this place is definitely worth going back to  
P => Satisfactory   no problems I asked for a quiet room and was given one at the back overlooking the police station car park  My room had fridge and coffee maker  My room was good sized st and elegant very clean and well orated but a bit dark for my taste  The hotel is about  mins walk to downtown or there are buses  Or you can walk about  mins the other way to the old town which is delightful  The main out of town bus station is only  blocks away and there are regular buses to Quebec about hrs and   The hotel restaurant does a good variety of breakfast meals and I only ate there one evening  Not many restaurants open in the evening  You need to go either downtown or old town  the staff were pleasant and helpful but sometimes rather formal  A nice hotel and no problems  
P => Better than expected I did all the price research online before leaving for Montreal but I wasnt sure if I needed to stay overnight so I left it to chance  I walked in asked for the price I saw on the internet and they gave it to me  it was around am and they have a room available  Further its one of the suites they have facing the front  According to the floor plan they have  of these bigger rooms on each floor  I know the area quite well and knew not to expect too much  I was pleasantly surprised with a comfortable stay The room and the bathroom were clean  The best thing is that they have wireless internet access throughout the building I find the location very convenient since walkable to Chinatown yummy food and St Catherine shopping even on an  degree celsius day  My room actually has a sliver of a view of City Hall in Old Montreal Parking wise they have underground parking not sure how much  There is also a public  outdoor lot right behind the hotel at  a day which you can go in and out of as you wish  
P => OK We stayed here because the price was lower than the very expensive other hotels  The hotel is a  story glass tower and has a small restaurant which had good food  Our room was small clean and basic  The parking garage is nice and safe  The subway station is very close which was great as we were doing a lot of sightseeing  
P => Unless you get a price under  avoid We needed a room for only one night after having already stayed in Montreal and Tremblant at great hotels for only  or  more  The hotel looks great on the outside and the lobby is very nice  The room we stayed in was very bad  It was old musty and generally a very bad experience for  US  The room was small bathroom small and hallway dingy  be they are remodeling other floors but this one hasnt seen any work for many years  The location is good and internet is free  Parking was  at a nearby lot  Staff was courteous  I would look at hotels of the same price range closer to Old Montreal before booking this hotel as a last resort  
P => Very Helpful and Knowledgable Staff We booked the hotel through AAA for approx  CDN  The rooms were small but comfortable  The hotel only has  floors and some of the buildings around it are higher  So forget the good views The staff is extremely helpful and nice  They gave us excellant suggestions on places to visit and eat  They were great with directions  They have very limited hotel parking  So call ahead to reserve a spot if you will be parking at the hotel Satisfied with our stay Enjoy Ish 
P => Not that bad Based on price this hotel is okay  Provided we were there in winter it is not that convenient as opposed to some hotels near the old montr al  However staff were very friendly and parking is not overpriced  Rooms are okay just keep in mind it is a days inn Would recommend this hotel for summer trips and for people who dont want to spend much on accomodation  
P => Great value very good location I was having day surgery at H pital St Luc so I wanted to find a hotel close by to spend the night before because we were coming from out of town  I booked the room through the hotel website and it went smoothly The hotel is situation on Ren  L vesque Blvd  in downtown Montreal  Its  blocks from Saint Denis St  close to the metro Chinatown and downtown Check in was quick and they gave us a parking pass for a public lot a block north of the hotel  Parking was   for the night and we were able to extend that for the day for only   Our room was on the th floor and had  double beds bathroom closet and a dresser in which the TV was hidden  We were facing a side street but nevertheless heard the traffic in the morning on Ren  L vesque The room was clean and service was very good  I would recommend this to visitors and anyone going to the hospital since its a  minute walk  
P => Good deal for you money I stayed at the Days Inn for just over a week and had a hassle free stay  The staff were lovely and the rooms were ent size  Had a huge bed and all the necessary facilites  Bathrooms were clean  Only problem I had was there was no wireless access in the hotel room so I had to go down to the lobby to use internet  Location was good about  blocks from the Eaton center and close to restuarants and shops  Would recommend this hotel  
P => Fair for the Price Stayed here in ober   The hotel wasnt a total disaster the rooms were clean enough albeit a bit run down  The place had a distinct musty odor  The shower and water pressurehot water was good  The staff was friendly  The wireless internet access worked sometime sometimes not  The vending machines are a joke they only take CAD dollar coins  The neighborhood isnt the best but more non descript than dangerous  Close to the University and Metro but pretty far away a mile from shopping the hotel parallels the seediest stretch of St  Catherine Street  Some bums drunks and of homeless folks around but nobody that would rob you If you are on a tight budget this is probably the the cheapest quotbrand namequot downtown hotel  Just dont expect great things  
P => food absolutely awful    Do not eat in the little dining area on the ground floor its the worst kind of bland microwaved rubbish Ive ever eaten  No matter how cheap or easy it seems avoid it  Take a walk instead  Sadly we were so tired after arriving from the UK that we coulnt be bothered to go out  Conversely breakfast was good  Room was fine staff most helpful  Location made getting down on foot to the old port easy  Just be aware that there are a fair number of basically harmless down amp outs in the area and that some of them use parts of the nearest Metro station champ de s as a living area  
P => Very good stay Booked a last minute rate on the Days Inn website for  nights in the middle of tember and got a huge suite for  a nightBed was big and lovely   shower was a bit dribbly   two HUGE tvs free wireless Internet plus conference roomThe staff were polite and friendly but I felt the restaurant was a little pokey Other people here have mentioned about the location   I did see more tramps and sex shops that one would normally care for but then if youre using it as a base for Montreal it shouldnt really matter Overall   a positive stay for my first visit to a Days Inn       as for the guy below who had his backpack robbed from the backseat of the rental car   I would say if you left your backpack on the back of a car in any city anywhere in the world   chances are it would get robbed 
P => Nice hotel surrounded by thieves The hotel experience had been good during our first daynight in Canada until my backpack was robbed from the backseat of the rental car  Was loading baggage on a beautiful Sunday morning parked along the curb right in front of the Montreal Downtown Days Inn reception desk when approached by a well dressed middle aged gentleman with a foreign sounding accent waving a street map and asking directions  While he distracted me his accomplice opened the car and took off with a backpack with my Dutch passport keys travel info etc  While reporting the incident at the police station conveniently located on the same block another American hotel guest came to report his truck was stolen from the exterior parking lot used by the hotel hotel has only limited indoor parking  While reporting the incident to the hotel reception desk a third American guest reported his van had been broken into overnight in the same lot  The hotel is conveniently located but is at the edge of a rather seedy neighbourhood and apparently requires some cleaning up  Needless to say this spoiled much of the high expectations we had for our first Canadian vacation  Two weeks later back home trying to figure out how to retrieve my car from airport parking without keys and with a trip to the consulate for a new passport on tomorrows agenda I would like say thanks for nothing to the lowlifes in Montreal  Han van Gorsel Houston Tx USA 
P => Good quality friendly hotel We stayed for  nights at the beginning of e A well run hotel with friendly and informative staff  We were able to park outside the hotel while we unloaded our luggage  The hotel offered parking for  night in an adjacent parking lot we could see our car from the hotel room The reception staff were very welcoming and friendly  The reception area was modern and trendy and furnished with armchairs and sofas on ble flooring The hotel was located on Rene Levesque Blvd East within walking distance of the downtown area Ste Catherine St Old Montreal the Old Port Chinatown amp the Quartier Latin  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant Cafe Allegroon our first evening served by a very friendly and overworked waiter who was very accommodating even offered to go home to get icecream from his freezer as there was none on the menu The meal was tasty and good value in ambient surroundings  We subsequently bought our breakfasts in the hotel restaurant as it was convenient and tasty Our average sized room had  very comfortable double beds and plenty of luggage storage  There was a small window that looked out to the side of the building towards downtown and the port area  The room was rather dark and we needed the light on most of the time  The furnishings and or were reasonably contemporary and all very clean There was air conditioning coffee maker safe free newspaper free internet access ironboard TV Radioalarm hairdrier ent toiletries The bathroom was of a good size with good water pressure and adequate towels We did have a bit of a problem on leaving  When I paid the bill I had worked out the approximate price for extras such as parking tax and meals but the bill came to about   more than expected  When I queried this I was told it was all tax   quotin Canada you pay tax on taxquot I was told but I knew that my restaurant bills had already included all the tax and tips  I left it at that but worked out my bill later and realised that I had been charged extra for my nd nights stay even though I had prepaid a quoted price on the internet  I e mailed the hotel on my return to England and sent copies of my bills  The problem was promptly dealt with apologies made and a refund given I would happily return to this hotel and felt that at  night it was good value  
P => Good for a long weekend I stayed for Presidents Day weekend with my gf and it was really cold The Days Inn is nice except for the smell in the lobby seems like the sewer is backed up or something  Everyday it was like that dont know why  The hotel is in a good area two blocks to the metro   min from chiantown notre dame and a couple of banks  The parking lot could use some work the stupid bar wouldnt go up when we entered but when we left it would raise  ent size room if your a tourist if your sightseeing you wont spend that much time in there  Bathroom was clean every day and very nice fan was a bit loud though like a jet engine  The one complaint I have is that when we slept at night seems like there are teenagers or people partying loudly in the halls that woke us up most of the nights we were there  They should hire security to go through the halls at night or something  
P => Nice hotel needs some investment to improve it Nice room quite big but found the Hotel in general needed some big dollars investmentGirl at reception Alicia was really very kind and helpful  
P => Exellent Hotel near to Center The rooms were very clean exept of one hair on the cieling how in the bathroom  Big and comfortable beds  Parking outside was ok even when the area seems not that safe during weekday nights  Close to the underground city Notre dame both about     mins to walk and the interstate Very friendly and helpful staff wireless internet and more than enough towels Thank you very much 
P => Great Price and Location My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a night  I have read some of the reviews and found them to be quite harsh and after reading them I was affraid I made a mistake when I booked this hotel  Firstly I want to assure people that my stay was a pleasurable one  The hotel is in an excellent location walking distance to all the attractions old montreal saint dennis underground mall  It is located next to a police station so the streets are not as scary as some people suggested  The staff was extremely curtious and friendly they were quick to suggest places to visit and gave us a tourist map and took to the time to highlight important sites  We went up to the room and it was an average size room we found that the airconditionar was already working which was nice because it was C outside with humidity that felt like you were getting splashed in the face with boiling water  Immediatly however we noticed the eye sores the curtains and bedspread matched with a s pattern that made me a little ill to look at  The view was of the back of another building as I understand it unless you get a suite most views will not be very good  The bed was comfortable and everything was quiet the entire night we stayed there on a weekday which  have reduced the number of quotloud kidsquot which some reviews suggested frequent the hotel  There are two other negatives that should be noted the first is the bathroom light and fan are connected typically not a problem however the fan sounds like a jet taking off and if anyone gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom they will wake up anyone else staying in the room  Also it is so loud that my girlfriend could not hear me talking to her when she was in the bathroom and I was on the bed  Finally they have one vending machine in the entire building and it only has pop  The problem is the machine is so old it doesnt recognize half of my coins so I couldnt have a pop  It kept spitting my money back  By all right this is an average hotel however because of the excellent price compared to other hotels in downtown montreal I immediatly bump it to an quotAbove Averagequot rating  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to be close to everything montreal has to offer but doesnt want to spend alot of money to get it The parking is  for outside and  for underground very resonable compared to some of the other hotels  
P => Days Inn   Definitely Stayed at this hotel for  nights as part of a tour of Ontario and Quebec  Very well situated for walking to all parts of downtown or old town  Five minute walk from the nearest Metro station  Would strongly advise the use of the Metro system as it is clean cheap and reliable buy a  day pass for good value and ease as this allows unlimited travel  Hotel reception area modern and pleasant if somewhat small but this is no big deal  We were upgraded from a basic room to a deluxe suite and this was very pleasant indeed  Room was spotlessy clean nice furnishings and a small kitchen area with a fridge and sink  Although the hotel is situated on a busy road we were not aware of any traffic noise at all and we were on the rd floor  A bistro is located in the hotel The Allegro Bistro  The evening meals were reasonably priced and of a good standard served by a friendly although overworked waiter  The Room Rate included a complimentary continental breakfast  This was served in the Bistro by unsmiling barely civil staff  This is the only negative comment I can make about this hotel  If ever returning to Montreal would definitely use this hotel  
P => Best value in the city Ive stayed at this hotel for the past three years for the Jazz Festival in y and Ive been pleased every time  My experience has shown that the best rooms are on the second floor  These rooms have the best beds and bathrooms  They also have refrigerators and microwaves  As noted in a previous review this hotel is on a very busy street  If youre not used to city noise you ought to get a room in the old city  If you have been to Manhattan the area this hotel is in is like the area around Penn Station If you want to be pampered and pay over  per night for a hotel room you would be wise seek accommodations elsewhere  However if you want a clean amp safe hotel thats in a great location this is the place for you  St Denis Street where I go for most of my meals is just a  minute walk away  The quotold cityquot is also just  minutes away and the Metro on St Laurent which can take you just about anywhere is about a  minute walk away  Be sure to buy tourist passports for the metro theyre the best deal  Travel by Taxi in this city between Noon and Midnight appears problematic as Ive noticed pedestrians often outpace cars

P => Nice hotel This was a beautiful hotel the lobby is exquisite  There is a erate counter in the lobby with someone who can ask where things are places to eat time things open and close very helpful and they speak great english  The rooms are beautiful a little small but very clean with full length glass windows with a great view  Free internet is avalaible in the lobby  There was also a shop in the lobby that sold toothpaste snacks water etc  Also there is a parking garage underneath the hotel  
P => Wonderfully Accommodating and Enjoyable Hotel Finding this hotel on Expedia I stayed at Delta Centre Ville for five nights in ober   I was impressed from the moment we checked in  The staff was more than accommodating helpful and pleasant  Our room was beautifully updated and had a wonderful view of the city  It was also clean had a comfortable bed and the bath robe and bath products were good quality  The Signature Lounge on the top floor was lovely for enjoying a cocktail in comfort and beauty  The parking was convenient and easy for such a large city  The location was perfect and within walking distance to St  Catherine Old Port and the heart of downtown Montreal  I stayed in the room until mid afternoon one day and missed housekeeping  The staff was happy to have my room cleaned and restocked within minutes of my late request  The staff was also very nice to weigh our luggage when we checked out to ensure we were not over the weigh limit  Can t say enough about how professional and warm the staff was  The hotel itself is very pretty the lobbies elevators pool area restaurants and lounge were recently remolded attractive clean and comfortable  Unlike other reviews I did not find the elevators slow and my room was on the th floor  I really felt at home at Delta Centre Ville and will stay there again in the future  
P => Nice hotel with a great locatoin This is a nice hotel for the price  The pros of this hotel arePool areaLocation   right near all attractionsStaff is extremely nice and helpfulParking is easier and not too bad priced for a big cityThe metro is right near by and close to all shopsNice balconyBig roomsConsSlow elevatorsOverall we always have a very nice stay at the Delta  
P => Perfectly nice business hotel Some of the reviews of this hotel are disturbing makes me wonder whether we all were in the same place even if at different times  I found it good  I visited for a conference stayed  nights and with a AAA discount got the cheapest room for  a night minus taxes  Room was on the th floor but I arrived late to the conference  Friends had rooms on the st floor  It was thoroughly comfortable clean wherever I looked had a comfortable bed and very good service from maids concierge bellman  Apparently people nearby had small children I heard them through the door when they played in the hall  BUT I heard nothing through the walls themselves so the soundproofings very good    unless the parents kindly muffled their kids when theyre all in the room together  The hotel food was overpriced and only ok    but plenty of places to eat nearby and some excellent upscale restaurnats within  minute walk  My only complaint is that the water pressure was not particularly good but I certainly was able to wash completely  And I didnt know about the pool in advance so didnt bring my bathing suit  
P => great stay great location we spent one week in this hotel to assist at a conferencea bit suspicious about the negative reviews we had been readingwe had altogether a very fine stay of course the hotel was a bit dated but rooms were spacious and clean and very silent with great beds  thebathroom was ok and the breakfast was also very nice  only strange thing there was no safe in the room  
P => nice place The hotel was nice and the room are nice and are nice view from top of the hotel  Great location in the center of the town  Many shops and restaurants are around within walking distance  
P => A comfortable hotel with a good location in Montreal We stayed at the Delta Centre Ville for  nights in tember  We had none of the problems with cleanliness that previous reviewers seem to have experienced  The room on th floor was large and comfortable  Some of the furniture in the room seemed a little quotdatedquot but this was by far outweighed by the great views of the city from the room which had large floor to ceiling windows  Plenty of space to hang clothes in a walk in wardrobe again rather old fashioned style   even managed to get both suitcases in there as well The room was quiet but I would recommend you ask for a room on a high floor as the hotel is on a busy ction so traffic noise  be a problem on a lower floor facing the road The hotel is in easy walking distance to the old town the shopping areas and the station and is around  mins by taxi from the airport  The reception area is light and spacious but this feeling is not continued into the bar and restaurant  The restaurant on the ground floor did not look amazingly inviting as it seemed quite dark although plenty of people were eating there  The bar had no atmosphere at all and could really do with a modernization to make it more inviting  We did not eat at the hotel at all  For breakfast we walked up to the Via Rail station turn right and go up the hill   only a few minutes walk and there is a wonderful little place within the station that cooks the breakfast in front of you while you wait   the panckaes and maple syrup have to be tried Alternatively if you walk through the restaurant and continue through the door at the end there are esculaters down to various places for breakfast and coffee rather than pay the hotel prices      There are also lots of places for evening meals in Montreal quotold townquot The swimming pool is rather small and also very deep  My husband is a tall man and even he could not stand in the water in the majority of the area of the pool   definitely not suitable for children  The pool was a good temperature and it was not busy when we went there so was fine Overall a clean and comfortable hotel we found and we would stay there again  
P => Dont do it  I am returning from several nights at the Delta  Heres my experience   Positives Beautiful building  Excellent location  Easy metro access Negatives We had no water  Pumps were down for repair and we were told to visit the pool if we wanted to wash up  Leftover hair and stains on the bed linens  Rather difficult parking  No wireless internet  Rude concierge desk  
P => BED BUGS I stayed with a friend at this hotel for the weekend of     and the first morning my friend woke with bug bites on his legs  I didnt know what to think but as the the weekend finished the bites continued  One week later I woke in my own bed with bite ks all over my back and arms  I have never had this problem before in my bed and as a result have lost my mattress and box spring  I complained to the hotel manager who says its the first she has heard of it  Now I am waiting to hear back from her as she quot INVESTIGATESquot the problem  Most likely the hotel will tell me that its not their fault and dismiss my accusations of bed bugs in their hotel  but I am sure they came from there 
P => Good value Good value and ideal location if you have business or a conference at the International Civil Aviation Organisation  
P => Beautiful hotel and Friendly staff We redeemed Asiamiles points for a  night stay at this hotel  I thought it was very grand and beautiful  The staff was friendly  Since I made the online booking first for  nights then a nd booking for one more night so we were assigned two different rooms at check in  The lady clerk was nice who offered to change it so that we did not have to pack up and move to a different room the next day  Many times when I had questions about directions and airport transportation etc they were all very friendly and helpful It s very conveniently located in Old Montreal and is not far from the Old Port and China Town  There are underground pathways that connect to Victoria Station and other buildings  Lots of shops and restaurants nearby However there are some issues that I do hope the hotel will improve on although these issues did not affect our brief stay at the hotel  First the air conditioning vent outlet in the room seems to be quite dirty  We could see the part of ceiling where the air is blown against is all blackened which indicates that airducts need to be cleaned  There is a possibility that they were cleaned but the ceiling had not been repainted since we thought the air was quite fresh  However the blackened ceiling does scare the guests living within Second the bathroom was lacking towel racks  We wanted to support the eco friendly idea by keeping the towels for our nd day s stay but once the towels were removed from the cabinet under the sink we could not find any place to put the wet towels  There are only two small hooks on the walls which don t hold big towels very well Third the gym is too small and not very well equipped  We have checked it out once but did not use it  There were only  treadmills and were all occupied when we visited and the weights were not secured tightly to the bar so there is a safety issue here On the whole it s a very nice hotel Tips on restaurants All the restaurants in the hotel tend to be pricey  I recommend the followingsCasual meals Cr perie Chez Suzette  St Paul street E Formal dinners James Rooster  Rue de la Commune Vieux Montrealent Chinese meals dimsums and dinners Chez Chine Restaurant within Holiday Inn Select Montreal Centre Ville Downtown  Viger Ave amp St  Urbain St 
P => Good business hotel This is a good hotel for conferences    theyre set up for it and they really have it together  The rooms are OK though none that we saw had fabulous views  Did not hear any noise from surrounding rooms  Service is first rate  Whats also good is that you can travel underground from the hotel to many parts of the city so if its raining thats a great thing  
P => Good hotel Okay location Weekend trip location was a little walk from the malls and attractions  The pool is alot smaller than the website shows  
P => Great Location  Great hotel I stayed a weekend with my dhter  We had a blast The staff was friendly and helpful comfortable rooms comfy beds clean  restaurants small store clothing store spa nice indoor pool lots of elevators that are very fast We will stay here again  We got a great deal on Hotwire for   a night in y  well worth it They have high speed internet you just have to use computers in lobby or take your lap top and ask for an access code an you can only use it in the lobby  Park below the hotel in the back just dont charge it to your room  the hotel charges what they want  double Pay the garage attendant when you leave to go home 
P => Perfect for the train We only stayed one night but as people who use the train we found this hotel to be very convenient to the station  It is a very big and busy hotel but the staff were fast and efficient when checking in  The room was very comfortable even though it was a little worn with age  There are better and cheaper hotels in Montreal but the location is great  
P => Ok hotel in Ok location We stayed at this hotel for approximately  nights in y   We were there for a swim meet  The positives were that we could access the metro from within the hotel  Also the kids menu was reasonably priced and tasty  We stayed on the Signature Club floor   There was a continental breakfast and free drinks and small snacks from  pm  The food at the lounge wasnt replaced and was just ok for the extra night  However we did complain about this to guest services and they credited us for one night of the lounge and gave us the parking of day for free  So we were happy with the guest services  The pool is a little small but ok for small children  The staff were very friendly at the front desk and throughout the hotel  The value is fairly good for the price  It is definitely a   star hotel and not a  star hotel  There was a turndown service and cleaning was well done  I think we would try a different hotel next time closer to the shopping area but I would recommend the hotel for business people  
P => Its a Blast from the Past Baby The best can be said about this hotel is that its lhably bad  It was apparently built for the Montreal Olympics in   The only things that have changed are the carpets curtains and upholstery  The bathroom is one step above penitential with those funky plastic handles that were cheap circa  tiny bathtub and running toilet  Great value though still going strong in   From the pole lamp in the bedroom to no mini bar no in room safe for valuables indifferent and actively disengaged staff the only reason to stay here is price  But truly even at the low price its so dated and the service is so poor its got to be the last choice  Food quality and selection is contemporary greasy spoon  The place is clearly set up for the lowest common denominator and even does that poorly  On the upside the bed was comfortable it must be new  If its this bad to stay there I shudder to think what it must be like to have to work there  Theres a second Delta in Montreal  Perhaps its better  After this experience I wont be giving it a try  
P => Great location excellent service great weekend We visited Montreal with friends for an extended weekend  This was the first visit to the Delta Centre Ville even though we have been to Montreal on many occasions  The location was ideal as it was a  minute walk away from Gare Centrale Central Train Station as we arrived on VIA Rail  The hotel was only one block away from the Square Victoria Metro Subway station  We purchased the  day Carte Touristique for   It gives you  days of unlimited transit use  We were within walking distance of many attractions and the shops of Ste  Catherine St The Delta Centre Villes rooms were large as we had a King sized bed  The bed was very comfortable  The view was to the North looking upon the office towers and Square Victoria  The washroom was clean and roomy  A nice desk and lots of light  High speed internet was available for a fee  Did not use this on this trip  The only area for improvement was that the wall paper could have used a change   looked a bit dated The pool on the th floor was very nice with a small but well equipped gym  Bring your ear phones for the TVs on the treadmills  The pool was quite warm and has two shallow ends with a deep middle  There is a patio off of the pool area The staff were very personable  There is a small tuck shop on the lobby floor and a small boutique  All staff were fluent in English and en francais  There is a very nice revolving restaurant on the top floor  We viewed the restaurant but did not eat there  Overall a great stay and service at the Delta Centre Ville  
P => Rather Dissapionted Hotel lobby very nice and well laid out nice and clean staff friendly and helpfull  we had room  which was not that good to be honest bit tatty really  carpets faded furniture scratched and chipped the chrome on bath taps had been rubbed away and there was a chip in sink there was also a plastic bag over the extractor the tv was s deluxe model and the remote didnt work lol  also one of out cups had a chip and the windows were not very clean apart from cobwebs on ceilling the room was clean and the bed comfy when we arrived there was some dicarded pizza boxes and crumbs in the hallway these were still there when we left  days laterOn the plus side we enjoyed breakfast in the resturant Rather dissapionted really 
P => Nice hotel good location but pricey  Rooms could use some updating but comfortable  Double beds instead of queen beds not so nice   a day for high speed internet free use of  computers with printers in the lobby  Great location for walking every where was travelling with parents in their s they did OK walking  Good access to the Palais de Congres Conference Centre about a  minute walk  Subway stop about a block away  Underground parking garage is very tight we had a Yaris and it was OK but a big carSUV would be a nighte  Nice workout centre with TVs on the cardio equipment and a sunk for tanning  The pool is very small and no hot tub but there is a sauna in the change room  Very friendly staff  
P => Great Hotel in the Heart of the city  I stayed at Centre Ville for  great nights this   The hotel was great  The rooms were wonderfull with luxerious beds and beddings  You can walk the whole city from this vantage point   mins to old montreal and  mins to Rue St catherine  The metro is a quick walk from the basment which gives you full access to this World class city  the pool area is very slek and nice and the roof top revolving resturaunt has award winning views of the enitre city allthough the food is a bit pricey  We booked directly with the hotel and mathced the rate expedia was going o give us  per night  We also had the premium rooms  disregard any neg comments unless your an uber snob this place rocks  Oh on a side note the room service selection was some of the chepest i have EVER seen in a hotel i could actually afford to order it 
P => Good enough It was not our first time in Montreal  In the past weve stayed at the Hyatt Sheraton and Intercontinental  Since none of these hotels could give me a travel agent discount rate I booked thru Hotwire  I chose a   stars at a rate of US  I have not used Delta hotels in the past so I was quite surprised that this was what I got from Hotwire  I had to check out with Trip Advisor for a background of the hotel  I was disappointed with the negative reviews but I got valuable tips that made my stay wonderful  The front desk was so accommodating and every hotel staff for that matter was so friendly and helpful  From the reviews I learned that the premier rooms were recently reated so I asked to be upgraded for an extra night  We were given a room on the th floor overlooking the river    it was fantastic No major complaints except for the fact that you have to wait for  minutes after check in before water would be available in your room There are no noticesigns for this and when I phoned Housekeeping what I got was a rather routine rek of quotwait for  minutes quot I just hope that they will post a sign for this for everybodys convenience  I agree with the reviews that the bathroom lacks some racks to hang towels and that the reated room did not include newer faucet and door knobs  They should have spent a little more for these  The walk to the Metro station is not that bad and the undergound link is so convenient as well as the food court on the lower level of the bldg  The food court close at pm and they are not open on weekends  The food inside the hotel is expensive  Overall for the price of US a night this is a steal When I return to Montreal I will book at Hyatt ahead of time for a shorter walk to the subway and a bigger food court  
P => Clean and comfortable but nothing special I stayed here for  days while attending a conference  The hotel is very close to the convention center and subway as well as connected to the quotunderground cityquot  It is in the financial district which is a ghost town on the weekends so I would not stay here for a pleasure trip  All of the rooms have floor to ceiling windows my room was clean and large with a desk  The bathroom was spacious but lacked towel racks and a place to hang a robe or toiletry kit  All of the staff were efficient  and pleasant  The hotel is a bit dated  The coffee maker cord had the grounding plug cut so it would fit an extension cord that was plugged in behind the TV  Not only did it not work but what a silly dangerous thing to do  Why not just get the correct extensions I would probably not stay here again  
P => Wonderful hotel We just came back from a weekend in Montreal and of course we stayed at the Delta Centre Ville  I would definitely stay here again We paid a little extra night for a premier room which put us on the th floor there are  floors then a revolving restaurant and gave us a large room with a king size bed  The bed was without a doubt the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept in The room was very clean spacious and I was surpised and happy to see that they had a clock radio with an ipod dock which meant I could recharge my ipod easily for our  hour train ride home  The staff was awesome and took the time to talk to us at every opportunity  The hotel is situated between Downtown Montreal and Old Montreal and we felt it was in the perfect location for us  We literally walked everywhere From the moment we got there we walked from the train station to the hotel which took approximately  minutes then the rest of the weekend we walked all over old Montreal which has an old European feel to it to Chinatown to downtown Place des Arts up to Mont Royal and then of course to the Bell Ctr for a hockey game  Monteal is very easy to get around if you like walking and this hotel is in a great location to easily access all of it It is also connected to the quotunderground cityquot which would be helpful if the weather is bad  It was nice to have a couple of computers conveniently located in the lobby so that we could quickly check our emails on our way inout  Overall our stay at the Delta Centre Ville was awesome as were the views from our th floor room 
P => Book a king sized bed     Heaven First of all book a superior room which doesnt cost that much  We always pay  when we visit for one night  We get a king sized bed for  people which is perfect  We even have room for two pillows between each other  They really have a good breakfast and their cheese pizza is to die for  The poutine is also very good and so is their cesar salad  Basically everything they have to eat is good  The service itself is good  We got there earlier than usual one time and we had no problem leaving our bags in the room  The location is very convenient also because they have a metro stop right under the hotel  You can access it by the restaurant which is pretty cool  The pool is such a fun place to be  Its located up high so you get a nice view of Montreal  All in all this hotel is my first choice  
P => great place for a smallmedium conference The North American Youth Exchange Rotary International Officers just used this hotel for a three day conference   of about  people  The hotel was nearly perfect  All the staff were pleasant courteous and helpful  The rooms were bright clean spacious  Buffets for breakfast and lunch were top notch  Public transportation is immediately available taxis of course are right there as is the Metro subway 
P => Nice location very comfortable beds  In the heart of the financial district this hi rise hotel is clean and somewhat modern  Lobby is spacious but our room not so much  It was pretty standard but the extremely comfy bed and pillows made up for it  Two of the most interesting things at the Delta the glass elevator and revolving restaurant on the top floor  While the food was pricey and just okay exception   beautiful artisan chocolates the views of the Montreal were spectacular  The downfalls pool is on the small side theres no hot tub and the parking garage is small with a terrible layout  Its connected to a public parking lot so it was very confusing for us to know where to park  The location of the hotel is great  We walked to the St  Catherine shopping district in about  minutes  Old Montreal was just a few blocks away too  If youre someone who likes to stay smack in the middle of the action this  not be the right hotel since the financial district seems to really clear out on the weekends  If you dont mind walking a few blocks its a perfectly good place to stay  
P => Nice stay but a bit dated I was at Montreal for a conference and stayed at Delta for  nights  I agree with what other reviewers have posted the hotel is a bit dated and not really a   hotel not very secured door no fridge or safe in the room and water pressure was pathetic  Despite all the minor faults of the hotels hardware Id still give this hotel a  star rating for its really friendly staffs  The guy who checked me in was really nice and answered all the questions Ive about internet room upgrade etc  Few days later while I was using the computer at the public area the printer failed to print and another member of staff went through all the troubles to connect another printer for me just so I can print off my document and he was really patient and apologetic really cant thank him enough for doing this  When I checked out I needed to put my bills into  arate receipts and the staff again was very nice and helpful  Also the location of the hotel is very convenient  It is very close to the conference centre about mins walk notre dame and rue catherine  Its a good place to stay if youre here for a business trip or a short holiday  
P => Fine for a short trip Stayed at the Delta for a conference at the Palais du Congress  The hotel is getting a bit dated as noted by others who reviewed here  Good points location for conference centre location for Old Montreal very very comfy beds helpful front desk staff  Bad points some parts of the hotel are looking a bit shabby our door looked as if several people had tried to kick it down in the past free internet access in lobby only not in rooms no safe in room lack of water pressure in shower  I do feel a bit bad about the last point as I complained at the end of my stay about the shower and the lovely staff on reception were upset that I hadnt complained earlier so that they could have got someone up to look at it   I just presumed this was how the showers were  All in all it was Ok for business but I wouldnt stay there if I was in Montreal on a personal visit  
P => Good value nice reated rooms The Delta Centre Ville is one of two Delta in downtown Montreal  It is conveniently located within walking distance of the train station and close to the old Montreal area  It is connected to the Montreal Underground walking network RESO and accessible via the Square Victoria Metro station exit Tour de la Bourse Many rooms have been reated over the years so most of them are in good shape  Bathrooms have been relatively well maintained although they somewhat show their age specially bathtubshower The hotel has three panaromic elevators on one side which are neat The gym is reasonable featuring the standard training equipment ellipticals treadmils bikes all equipped with TVs  a few machinesweights  Pool area also looks good The top floor features a panoramicrotating restaurant Tour de Ville which usually featurs a theme buffet  The main floor has a more casual offering Chez Antoine where you have access to a very good breakfast buffet in the morning If you have access to the Signature club floors and lounge the lounge offers a nice panoramic view of the city  The food offering is rather thin though compared to other hotel lounge and price relatively steep for alcohol  
P => Good location good vaiue good ammenities Great location for us   very near a subway stop Square Vittoria and between Vieux Montreal and the Downtown walking distance to both  Pool sauna fitness room free internet in the lobby day in the room  The immediate area is very quotbusiness likequot   tall buildings banks train station and the Montreal stock exhange but it is a short walk to more lively areas The only reason I didnt give it a quotquot is because it was looking a little worn    clock radio didnt work worn desk light didnt work in the closet    all minor things but it could be freshened up a bit  We paided  a night which I thought was a good deal  people in one room  
P => Par excellence Wife and I returned to Quebec to celebrate our near th wedding anniversary driving to Montreal from Burlington VT airport  We experienced no problems at check in nor with access to parking garage  The floor was quiet and the room was excellent roomy and provided with extra touches like full cotton robes and comfortable bedding  Frankly it was more than expected for the  p d  Hotwire rate Spaces are tight in the parking levels and one might take care esp  with a rental car from dings  The access to amp from garage and lobby via hotel elevator is relatively easy amp convenient  There are nice shops at lobby level  Somewhat confusing is the exiting of the garage with less than specific directions and gating but one will emerge The parking fee is reduced for guests C pd and one should validate entry at the front desk for credit  Actually with the exception of an evening drive and dinner in Petite Italie worth the visit a vibrant Italian section full of select restaurants w sidewalk dining we dined locally in Vieux Montreal a short walk from the hotel and along the river  There is a fabulous breakfast cafe and reasonably priced menu near the cathedralbasilica a short walk We did not dine at the hotel  The staff were friendly cordial and professional from front desk to our room attendants  
P => Loved this hotel Have just returned from Montreal following a conference Had access to the signature club lounge with free internet and continental breakfast  Melissa was very sweet and helpful  Easy walk to Palais de Congres and Notre Dame Basilica  The walking tour of Old Montreal was excellent and also enjoyed the Sound and light show at the Basilica Loved the hotel and loved Montreal  
P => Good location helpful desk staff The only thing I didnt like about this hotel was the lobby or more accurately the lack of any lobby  The entrance area was crowded with suitcases of checked out guests  There is no place to sit and the narrow spaces quickly became difficult to navigate as the ground floor is confusingly laid out  The elevators are far from the entrance and front desk  To exit toward Victoria Square which is where youd logically want to exit you have to walk through the restaurantOtherwise the Delta is wonderfully located an easy walk to the old city conference center Chinatown shopping and the metro  My room was spacious modern and comfortable  The  internet connection charge was unwelcome and the connection became slow at times but both are typical of business hotels One big plus was the woman Nancy at check in  She helpfully supplied maps and gave very clear directions on how to find the various spots I needed to reach  
P => Comfortable rooms pet friendly policies and staff I have stayed at this Delta hotel many many times in the past year because it is within walking distance to my business offices  I prefer to stay at major brands to collect pointsstatus but this Delta is very close to work and the  WebSaver  prices found on the hotel website have been very reasonable in the   range sometimes slightly less when using a CAAAAA auto club discount  The rooms are clean and this hotel has a lot of competition nearby  The beds in the  Signature Club  rooms feel more comfortable but these rooms can cost more if you do not get an upgrade from Delta s guest program  Another thing to note is that the Club Lounge is only available to guests that are staying in a Signature Club room   it doesn t matter if you are GoldPlatinum Delta Privilege Members  So let me tell you about the pet policy at this hotel because I have had an above average positive experience with this  My wife and I have an  pound Maltese dog small white dog and this Delta most Delta hotels have been very welcoming  They even have a small welcome treat bag for your dog  The staff have all seemed receptive and greeted our dog with a smile  I say this because some places say that pets are welcome but the staff at some hotels treat you like you re dragging a dirty mop through the lobby  Anyway Delta s pet policy here is very good  There  be a  pet fee but we haven t had to pay this yet and there is no information on the hotel s website  Some more pet info   you dog will want to go out and do hisher  business   There is a nice grass area in the front of the hotel and if you walk eastbehind the hotel you will see Victoria Square which has a nice grass area with trees benches and water fountains in summer  Enough about the pets   a very cool thing about this hotel is the access to the Montreal Underground  Yes you can walk past the hotel barrestaurant and straight into the famous underground mall containing shops and access to multiple places downtown  Enjoy  
P => This is a  star hotel  and Im being generous First off I cannot believe any of the flattering reviews this hotel has received  We arrived at the place and were immediately told that are car could not be parked in the hotel garage  Hellllo So we had to unload everything and park at a nearby convention center  We booked two adjoining rooms for our family of four and got two rooms that were not adjoining and in fact not near each other  Our rooms were reated but they neglected half the hallway which had ripped up linoleum that was not hidden from view  The rooms are very small and ours came complete with an old chewed up apple core under one of the beds The giant picture window had some sort of disgusting white crud all over it that looked like the glue residue from stickers  There is no mini bar  The bathroom had fixtures from the year one  The sink had cracks  We ordered room service which was supposed to take  minutes and took an hour and a half  They got the order wrong and had to wait another half an hour  The food was inedible and smelled rotten  The exteriors of our lovely reated rooms had dents and chip ks all over the doorframes as if someone went through the halls kicking at doors  
P => Pleasant stay good location I booked this hotel on Priceline for night USD  taxes  I was a bit worried about the stay given some of the reviews here but I was pleasantly surprised  Check in was fantastic    the clerk who served me was very polite and accommodating and I was able to receive a non smoking room with a king bed on a high floor without any problem  I was on the th floor and was told this was a reated room so that  be the difference with the other reviews  The location was very good    a very short walk to Old Montreal and close to the Bonaventure and Square Victoria Metro stops  The walk to Ste Catherine street is a longer walk but Id been to Montreal many times before and didnt need to frequent there very often  There is a food court a few stories down in the underground city that the Delta is connected to  The best connection Ive had to the underground city however is at the Hyatt Regency Montreal which I have booked also on Priceline for about night  For those who are visiting Montreal for the first time the transit system offers a  day pass for unlimited travel for CAD which is a great deal  The building itself is a bit dated but theyve done well with trying to keep the interior up to date  The entry foyeratrium is quite impressive still and the hallways are bright with what seems to be new carpeting  The reated room had more quotmodernquot furniture and the bed was quite comfortable  My only issue was the bathroom plumbing and fixtures which were still on the old side  The counters and shower etc  however were updated  This seems to be quite common in Montreal from the other hotels Ive stayed in there  I didnt find the room terribly small as others have noted  Internet access is  day  tax  If I had one major complaint it would be their luggage storage    they dont seem to have a dedicated locked room for storage so the bags sit in a roped off area of the lobby which was left unattended quite a bit  Also the bellman who took my luggage for storage actually asked for a tip    I had never had that experience before  I was going to tip him anyway but to be blatantly asked was a bit odd  Overall I was quite pleased with my stay there and would stay again  For night certainly no complaints  
P => Friendly service   despite the labour disputes My partner and I received a pretty good deal through Travel Zoo for a Club Signature Room  It was  per night and included access to their Club Lounge continental breakfast and internet charges included All in all it was a good experience  When we arrived it turned out that there was a labour disruption and some of the services expected could not be provided  But since we arrived at  pm   we werent missing out on anything  They told us that everything would be resolved that night by midnight and everything back to normal the next day  With the exception that the whole staff wearing some kind of solidarity t shirt for the next two days   sure enough we never heard about a labour disruption again Biggest complaint would be the room itself  It was functional and clean but the room is definitely more than a little out dated  And could really use a modern touch in terms of furniture paint and bathroom  Could have been a nice Days Inn  But the bed and bedding were very nice and everything was exceptionally clean and the cleaning service the next day was very good  So no huge complaints I booked that room priily because I had to do some work during the weekend and internet was free with the room  This worked effortlessly  Though I just plugged in   and didnt try the Wifi The continental breakfast was very good  Fresh fruit pastries ample coffee juices cereals etc  Though on our second day it seemed completely unattended labour dispute We just loaded up plates and brought them downstairs to our room We didnt use the pool  It looked ridiculously small My partner had a massage on our second day and ranked it among the best shes had  Very solid and at  for one hour   not a bad price  Estheticians do not work on the weekend apparently The location is great if you want to visit old Montreal or walk a few blocks north to a main shopping district  We did both and were happy with the location  But it is located on the edge of the financial district and is not pretty or very cultural  Those looking to visit the Plateau or find themselves in the middle of a crazy nightlife scene might look elsewhere  This is not a funky hotel Parking is kind of pricey at  per night   but in keeping with the location  And its good to know its nice and safe three miles under ground like that So all in all   an   Do wish theyd spruce up the rooms though Oh and by the way   we worried about the labour dispute till we walked by the Hilton the next day and saw that their workers were still off the job had a big truck BLARING rock music   and they were holding up visitors and blowing shrill whistles Looks like we got off early  
P => Comfortable Hotel in Great Location The hotel was in such a great location for us  Easy walking distance to Old Montreal Chinatown and downtown shopping  We brought our tandem bicycle and the hotel staff was very helpful in storing it for us  And we were able to access bike trails just moments from the hotel  The room was clean and large and the bed was comfortable and the room rate through Hotwire was  a night a great value for the hotel   We didnt eat in the hotel  The concierge recommended the Pyreenes restaurant in Old Montreal and the food wasnt great at all  
P => OK hotel for not a great price Location is OK   we walked there from the VIA rail train station  Service is really great very nice staff  The room is average   bordering on small  There is no bar fridge and the ice machine on our floor was broken  I didnt find the bathroom shower that nice   the tub was stained  There were only half rolls of toilet tissue   I had to call down to housekeeping for more  For   for  night I didnt think it was a great value  
P => Jazz Festival and Delta Hotel   GREAT TIME Stayed at the Delta Centre Ville over the Jazz Festival and what a great isionThis was our  year coming to the festival but first time at Delta  GREAT location fantastic staff and a rate you cant beat night  Located  blocks away from the festival how can you go wrongThe rooms have all been upgraded and the staff are personable and fun  Check in was a breeze and included discount coupons for breakfastI can not compliment this hotel enough  Keep it up and I cant wait to return next year  
P => Good for business traveller close to attractions  I stayed at this hotel for a business meeting During our stay the hotel staff were on strike as well as other unionized employees at all other Montreal hotels We ate at the hotels restaurant because we had our meeting booked but other guests were not permitted because the staff were on strike  I found the food was not very good  I enjoyed one lunch out of   The soups were however very tasty The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable however the bathroom was not cleaned very well  I am guessing that this was due to the employee strike The hotel is about a  to min walk from many shops amp restaurants near or on St Catherrine street The Casino is about a min drive while the Bell Centre where the Montreal Canadians play is about a  min walk  
P => Pleasant Stay at the Delta My husband and I stayed at the Delta for a quick getaway weekend last uary  We travelled to Montreal by train to avoid any potential winter weather problems and chose the Delta as it is within walking distance of the Via train station I had been in the Delta for meetings before and had been impressed by it but had never stayed there  I was not disappointed  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful  A porter promptly appeared and took care of our bags  The glass elevators that face to the street are quite impressive and scary if you are afraid of heights  Our room was medium sized but very comfortable with a small sitting area  It featured luxurious amenities like brand name spa toiletries and a feather duvet  Everything in the room worked perfectly and the room was spotless  The bathroom was larger than most  And even though the hotel is right downtown noise was not a problem at all We didnt try either of the hotels  restaurants which include Montreals only revolving one as they were out of our price range but since Montreal is litterally full of places to eat this wasnt a problem for us at all I would recommend the Delta to anyone visiting Montreal whether for business or pleasure  
P => Great hotel location could be better My only complaint about this hotel was its location  Dont get me wrong its near a Metro station Square Victoria and you can get everywhere you need by foot however for someone like me who likes to be in the middle of young fun vibrant buzzy areas   it was far too business like  I think it is a great location for people in Montreal on business   but for someone like me who wants great restaurants shops cafes and bars on their hotel doorstep   it wasnt the best choice  The hotel is surrounded by office buildings and even has the Stock Exchange building behind itNow onto the good stuff  The hotel is beautiful  The lobby is impressive the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful especially Nick the bell hop and the concierge staff the room was great bathroom was clean and the bed was comfortable  I had my nails done and had a massage in the hotel salon Terra on the th floor and would definitely recommend it to anyone  I didnt try out the swimming pool but it looked very appealing An interesting feature of the hotel was its glass panels in the lifts elevators on the South facing side of the building  For someone like me who is afraid of roller coasters it was like a fairground ride I felt a little ill every time I went in the lift and had to hold onto the side   but at the same time it was quite a thrillIf staying at the Delta Centre Ville depending on what youre looking for I would suggest checking out the shopsmalls on Rue Saint Catherine taking in the sites of Vieux Old Montreal going on a Gray Line bus tour and getting breakfast at Eggspectation on Rue Saint Jacques 
P => Delta Centre Ville   tiko pai rawa My colleague and I stayed at the Delta for a conference   we found the overall experience excellent  The bell hops and other staff were all really friendly and obliging The concierge gave us heaps of guidance and advice on the best way to tour montreal  Probably the only thing that wasnt too great was that you cant get larger rooms  My colleague and I found we were getting on top of each other and requested a larger room only to find that we were in the largest room not large at all Mind you we were there for  nights   probably not recommended as a long stay place  
P => ent downtown business hotel I booked this hotel for a business trip in Montreal  The Delta has always given quality service and good facilities The hotel is on the edge of the downtown core so one  not get the most spectacular views  The rooms are also a little dated but the beds and the plumbing are modern The pool and restaurant are adequate  The restaurant offers a standard pricey continental breakfast Being a downtown hotel means that one pays downtown parking rates  The hotel was undergoing parkade reations at the time so dragging luggage was problematic the other option valet parking is pretty expensive All that said the Delta is a solid property in Montreal around the corner from the W and I would book this property again  
P => Great Location ent hotel  My Fiancee and I and another couple stayed at this hotel over Easter weekend   The largest complaint is the Parking Lot  It is under construction but no one in the hotel will tell you this and tell you to go underground where a sign says quotLot Fullquot the only other option is to park in the Mall Public Parking and walk up a flight of stairs and two escalators and then a long walkway into the Hotel  The service was friendly and every time we asked for more towels or toothpaste or anything they were very prompt  although it took an hour and a half for our luggage to get from the lobby up to our room  The revolving restauraunt had a beautiful view but was extremely expensive  The best part about this hotel is that it is walking distance to everything in Montreal that interested us and it is attached to the RESO and we walked through there for hours I would reccomend this hotel as soon as their parking garage is fixed We did get out of the parking lot without having to pay but it took some social engineering  
P => Very Nice Hotel But Prices Vary So Check All Available Rates If your employer is searching for a place to hold a business meeting this is THE place to do it in Montreal This property lacks nothing  Service is a straight  at every level from the front door through the guest check in service to the revolving restaurant on the top floor to the rooms themselves  Families will be able to save money on food by visiting the food court two floors below the lobby where you can buy from McDonalds Chineese Emporium and similar fast food outlets  Several retail shopping stores one floor below the lobby carry mid priced clothing articles  The thing to be careful about is price  We paid  per night but I saw prices as high as   The only negative thing about this property is the requirement to pay   per day for Internet service  
P => Would Stay Here Again The staff at the Delta Centre Ville were quite friendly and pleasant  The room was nice and cozy  It is located at the centre of Montreal which makes walking to the St  Catherines to shop  The only complaint I have about the Delta Centre Ville would be the parking garage  It is dark gloomy and very narrow to navigate through  As well parking spaces were limited  Overall it was a good experience and I would return to the Delta  
P => Nice Stay The Delta in Quebec city was a very nice stay  They allow pets  Which is a plus considering we have two dogs  The hotel rooms were clean and comfortable  Beds were a little to short for my husband but he did not complain  Room service was great The food though not so great  The staff was very friendly and helpful  I like the stay and would recomend this hotel  The price is very reasonable considering it is very close to all the attractions  
P => Comfortable Im not a big fan of  room concrete hotels built in the s but I snagged a good rate on Hotwire and it was only one night  Despite the cold austere exterior I thought the hotel was better than expected  Interior lobby is warm enough staff helpful and the room and bed were surprisingly comfortable  Bathroom could use a little updating but everything in the room worked and it was quite clean  Location is central and better for business travelers than tourists  
P => not the best The Delta appears to be upscale  For us small family in  rooms there were some drawbacks that will keep us from staying there again  We had one king room and one with  dbl beds  They were unable to give us rooms on the same floor not a problem for us but could be for other families  The room with  dbl beds had some unused condoms in one of the drawers not a nice surprise  The rooms were otherwise very clean  The biggest complaints were that the pool was out of order when we were there  We were not offered anything for that inconvenience  Throw in a free breakfast in your restaurant to make us feel better at least  Really the lack of a pool was a bummer to us Also there was no hot tub I had assumed there would be    my mistake and the fitness center was not available either because of the pool  Both pool and fitness center were open by the last day  The location is okay but you can do better  It is attached to the underground but you will walk for  minutes just to reach the building across the street  I would recommend walking a bit outside to get to place Bonaventure before going into the underground  Parking underground was easy but dont bring a large car the ceiling is  and some cars would not make it Im sure  Montreal is a wonderful city and this is not the best place to stay  I would only do it for a really great price under  otherwise try the Queen Elisabeth or riot Chateau Champlain  
P => Loved the Delta Got a room here through Hotwire for a very good rate about   night Staff was very helpful and hotel was very nicely located  A  minute walk to the Bell Centre and many beautiful Churches  Only drawback was confusion about valet parking  Attendant said that valet parking was only available if arranged beforehand  This seemed quite odd considering how upscale of an establishment this is  In the end they parked my car for me Hotel can also be a little difficult to find by car especially if it is dark outside  
P => Stunning Design When I first walked into the hotel I noticed how well designed it is  The lobby is a dark wood  story area with the restaurant and board rooms on the side  The rooms are beautiful with very comfortable beds  The staff are great If you dont speak French no worries  From the waitresses to the maids all speak English  The meeting facilities are outstanding  A hude ballroom and many other small board rooms  Three stories of facilities are perfect for huge conferences I would absolutely recommend the hotel for anyone looking in that price range  
P => A nice posh hotel  This hotel is very plush and incredibly comfortable  The facilities were excellent and I particularly enjoyed the swimming pool which you can see from the elevator Breakfast was very good with lots to choose from but incredibly popular so be ready to queue for a seat  The hotel is in a good location for tourist attractions and access to the underground city  
P => Great value for a full service hotel You should have no worries booking and staying at this hotel great location and excellent value for the money  Its full service meaning pool and fitness club free free internet terminal in the lobby although theres only one and its often occupied room service gift shop great concierge and doormen restaurants and full bar  Stayed here for N over Labor Day weekend got a great rate at travelzoo com of night  Our room was a good size for a city hotel  We had  double beds which were very comfortable  There was also a good size writing desk and sitting area  The bathroom was bled and a ent size but the grout was stained which made it look dated  My only complaint on the room was the bathroom lighting it consisted of  large long light fixtures on each side of the mirror you couldnt dim or unloosen a bulb  Other than that room was fine  I want to mention the great bartender we had  Her name was y Claude and she was both professional and fun  She worked the bar in Antoines restaurant  Her service level was outstanding  Avoid parking in the garage that the hotel provides for  CAD day its expensive and hard to maneuver around once inside  Instead opt for one of the cheaper and plentiful outside parking lots that offer in and out priviledges from   CAD day  The location is excellent for walking you can easily walk to Notre Dame but also check out lesser known St  Patricks Church the morning light inside the church casted a warm honey glow over the pews very inspiring  Also if you are Polish or like Polish food you MUST repeat MUST visit Stashs Cafe in Old Montreal  Outstanding prices and food and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is quotPolish Modernquot with brick walls heavy wood tables funky artwork and great night lighting  
P => Good value great look I would certainly recommand this hotel for anybody willing to travel in style without being outrageously overbilled  Except for some issues ill point out later this hotel is generally a very good place to stay My first advice is to always consider spending a few dollars more to get a Signature room  Located on the upper floors read fantastic view those rooms come with more refined furnishing and appliances and a very worthy access to the th floor Signature Lounge right under the revolving rooftop restaurant wonderful  For a little less Premier rooms newly refurbished would also be a wise choice Otherwise regular rooms those called Delta rooms are still pleasant and well equipped  For around   CAD  person  taxes and tip their revolving rooftop restaurant is not that overpriced since it features very sophisticated theme buffets splendid view great cozy atmosphere are smooth service  While middle to high class hotel restaurants are generally soulless and too costly this one  be worth the visit  There are some downsides however  First as some other user pointed out there are issues with their front desk staff  Though check in was not troublesome in my case Ive experienced something disturbing  When I asked for a specific cab company to the stone faced employee he couldnt care less and turned me away rudely as he just did with a guest who before me asked for some directions  I hope this was just a mishap  Also their inside pool while good looking is rather small and the pool area is stifling  Not hot tub Finally just as an anecdote Delta is the th name this hotel bears since its opening in   First opened as R gence Hyatt then switched to Le Grand Hotel Gouverneur Radisson and finally Delta  Stay tuned for the next name change 
P => No complaints    There seem to be plenty of warnings from other travellers about lower floor rooms but we stayed on floor  and had no complaints at all  The room was clean well sized and in keeping with what we have come to expect from North American hotels Location is excellent being convenient for Old Montreal and the Downtown area  You can also get from the hotel via the underground passageway system which is a distinct advantage if it ides to rain although make sure you have a strong sense of direction if you choose this route  The buffet breakfast was well worth the money  Plenty of choice and very good quality  
P => Nice Hotel Great Location We just returned from a two night stay at the Delta Centreville and were very pleased This is a typical large full service hotel  The staff were very friendly and always helpful  Often if it was apparent that you were trying to figure something out they would approach you and offer assistance  Check in was very efficient  The rooms are clean quiet and neat  The hotel is in an excellent location   easy walking distance to the old city as well as the western downtown area  We didnt use the pool but it looked small and well used by kids  Parking is expensive      but standard for that part of the city  The lot is a little difficult to access when driving in but that wasnt a big deal  We were surprised that there was no mini bar in the room  Also ice is available only on every other floor  Beyond those little things we enjoyed our stay would definitely return and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel  
P => Great value service and amenities After reading some of the reviews here I thought the Delta Centreville would be a disappointment but I was wrong  I was greeted warmly by the front desk clerk  Then to my surprise I was escorted up to my room by a friendly and helpful bellman who told me about the facilities and restaurants in the hotel  He even showed me which button to push in the elevator to go down to the lobby  Now this might seem trivial but it demonstrated to me that even the littlest detail didnt get overlooked I had a standard room with  queen beds  For its class the room was slightly smaller than most hotel rooms Ive stayed in Montreal but the bed was comfortable and the linens and pillows were great  I enjoy views so having a floor to ceiling window was great The swimming pool is small and often overrun by kids so I didnt partake  They had a nice size fitness room with lots of equipment  I prefer the long walks around the city and under the city  The underground tunnel system is accessible oddly enough by walking through the lobby restaurant I had dinner at the rotating rooftop restaurant called Tour de Ville  I was thoroughly impressed by the views and totally satisfied by the quality of the food and service  Its pricey but considering the food the furnishings and the views I think it was fairly priced On the down side   theres no hot tub in the pool area  I had to pay a daily fee for Internet about   There was no valet parking at least when I arrived  I had to drive around the block to look for the access ramp into the underground garage  Overall these are not major issues I got a good price through Hotwire  I would not hesitate to stay at Delta Centreville again  
P => Great hotel  warm people We were attending a convention the first week end of ust   The staff at this hotel is perfect  nice  smiling  they have that five stars attitude   The warm and friendly hospitality of Montreal can be feel everywhere in this hotel  We had a brand new reated room  bigger than other standard bedroom of other hotels   They have a very nice revolving roof top restaurant that is amazing   good food  great hospitality     we will certainly go back  
P => not too bad for the price We planned our trip to Montr al on a tight budget so we had to use Hotwire to find accommodations all other hotels in the area were almost   We were assigned the Delta Centre ville for  plus the huge Canadian taxes  After a  hour train ride into town we were happy to see the hotel was only about  blocks from the train station  The lobby was typical for a convention hotel nothing special  Our room was on the th floor and was a bit smaller than what we were expecting  It had a pretty good view out the large window all the rooms here have some view of the city  We were disappointed to see that the room didn t have the amenities a   hotel should have  No fridge or minibar no safe no wireless internet ect  We had to rent a fridge for an extra fee but it was well worth it and it was a big one The hotel is in a location that is near the convention center and train station  It is about a  minute walk to where all the action is on St  Catherine s street  The port unknown to us until the last few days is on the other side of the hotel about   minutes away  The area is pretty dead at night and it was a terrible task to find food in the area on the weekend  However the metro is accessible by  stops near the hotel one of which is found without even going outside  The concierge was helpful but often times there were a long wait  There was also a computer with internet that guests could use in the lobby for  minutes free again always a line to use it  The pool area was small as most city hotel areas are  There was a good sized fitness center and a sauna but no whirlpool  The quotspaquot as it is advertised on some sites is really no more than a one room massage area for guests  I found the sunk outside looking over the city to be relaxing in the afternoon The hotel has two restaurants a bar and bistro which serves a buffet breakfast and light lunch and the revolving fine dining restaurant on the th floor  We ordered room service one night and although it was quickly delivered to our room the food was lackluster and overpriced as expected  However one of the highlights of our trip was eating at the restaurant at the top of the hotel  Saturday night they have a buffet that is quite expensive and quite good  The staff was excellent up there and we tried everything deer pork salmon lobster shrimp roast beef and the list goes on  All and all the Delta Centre ville was a good value for the price we paid  We have been to better hotels but this one served our needs fine  If you have any questions feel free to contact me outside looking over the city to be relaxing in the afternoon  
P => Dirty Front Desk Staff Attitude Wretched I am sorry to report that our stay at the Delta Centre Ville was unacceptable  I might feel a little differently if wed paid the hotwire type prices under  but we paid the room block rate of the convention we booked with   As one of my colleagues in the room block said quotthey dont know our group they dont care about our groupquot and that was for sure  Luxe hotels like W and Place des Armes were only slightly higher priced with significantly better facilities services and amenities The front desk staff general attitude was generally that customers are irritating distractions from other more important issues   and if there is a problem its likely the customers fault  Specific examples Two days before our arrival the hotel lost power in a storm and with it their electronic registration system  For the records they couldnt reconstruct like ours the first option they presented was not to deal with us at all  I pretended I was certain theyd find me a bed and when I didnt slink away the front desk staffer finally gave up and went to find a manager to ok us checking in  None of the payment arrangements that were made ahead by our group survived the power outage so many arrangements that wed made were lost  We requested one type of room configuration and were given another so had to switch rooms  The entire check in process from beginning to having an acceptable room took nearly one hour  Amenities were delivered for our group   and ours arrived at  pm  We were already in bed  Room service took  minutes and the waiter looked like it had been a very long short staffed night  Ice machines are on every other floor and those above and below us were down for the count so I went to the bar       where the barista told me there were ice machines on even floors  She eventually got me some ice when I explained that they didnt work the assumption that the customer is dumb        Upon checkout the clerk told us he could not open our folio to put two names on the bill essential for both of us filling out our expense reports  Although he said it was impossible another attack of deafness on my part proved that he could indeed perform this feat with the assistance of someone who knew how to do it so we got what we needed eventually The room although obviously recently reated as evidenced by the high quality mattress and bedding and HD flat screen TV was dirty and beat up  Every day we discovered OPH other peoples hair in our bathroom and the low thread count towels were stamped quotDelta Centre Villequot a la prison underpants to keep guests from stealing them Turndown service was provided and a free bottle of water       even though there were two guests in the room  Guess we have to do rock paper scissors for it Three plusses the hotel is old so the closet is old which means that it is quite large with lots of rod space and floor space   perfect for two women traveling together who have lots of convention costume changes  The second plus was the bathroom lighting   the best makeup mirror lighting I have ever experienced  Third the hotel is very conveniently located for Vieux Montreal and for the convention center   I could walk back and forth to convention activities even in heels On an eco front incandescent light bulbs throughout burning away  How about some compact flourescents No in room recylcing This hotel would be ok for under  but compared to the other properties and prices in our convention block represented atrocious price per value and very surly treatment by front desk  
P => Good if your booking at a discounted rate We booked through Hotwire so for the price the hotel was very good  However for a  star rated hotel on Hotwire I was expecting a little bit more Our room was on the th floor and had a good view  The room was small though orated nicely with modern fixtures and a neutral color scheme  The bathroom was very basic   nothing luxurious  I noticed some black mold growing in the corner of the tub  Yuck  We had no safe or minibarfridge in our room which was a disappointment  Internet access is available but it is not free The indoor pool is small and usually full of kids which is fine if you have kids  It closes at  but later hours wouldve been great for adults only  There is no jacuzzi with the pool Overall the stay was fine and I dont have major complaints but it is not a hotel I would seek to stay at again because nothing really impressed me  
P => The real deal    ignore many of the others    Lk Heres the deal folks ignore the bashing and the whatever else We booked Delta Centre Ville through Hotwire not knowing the hotel name in advance  I saw the hotel and thought well this looks pretty OK for  a night including taxes but got concerned after reading some reviews  Oh but my friend read on Yes the hotel has apparently reated upper floor rooms  Of course through Hotwire we got a deal on lower floor rooms  I got concerned would we have ancient furniture other problems etc  So I followed some advice and joined the hotels preferred club for free yet saw I would not get a free upgrade just from that Called the hotel to find we had two double beds with no single queens or kings left available  Had the phone receptionist make a note that we preferred a single large bed if available  I called phone reception both for the hotel and for the preferred membership several times and they were always exceptionally polite and accomodating sweet really  Yet they couldnt do much for us as far as the bed or the higher floor were concerned Showed up at the hotel  Were invited to upgrade to a top floor room for  a night  What a steal  Got a corner room with a fantastic view king size bed with pillowtop mattress bathrobes and all the amenities  Total  for two nights it benefited us to book on the weekend as this was a business hotel mostly booked for the week Their Sunday brunch looked fantastic but we opted out as it was  per  Found a few local restaurants after a bit of searching that were wonderful  Check in and  out were a breeze as were cabs to and from the hotel flat rate from the airport of   The concierge Sebastian was a dream come true when we asked to be directed to non touristic restaurants  Again the receptionist as well was a dream come true all our questions answered all our issued resolved with the preferred membership I would stay at this hotel anytime  If you get one of the cheaper low floor rooms I cant say what issues they  have  If you turn down a  upgrade to a pillowtop king mattress I cant help you  If you cant find the place with the  plus different kinds of mussels or the little cafe with poutine and smoked meat drop me a line  Go to Old Montreal but dont fall for the restos there  And be have the Sunday brunch buffet at the rooftop resto if you are feeling flush it cant be bad  We prefer the local places Best 
P => you get what you pay for This hotel is at convenient location near downtown old town and china town  However it was at the far end I drove around and it was a shady neighborhood with at least I saw  homeless sleeping onr the streets  I booked through hotwire for   Great deal for a  star hotel  Including tax it came out a little bit more than  night   My first time trying hotwire  I do not think this is a  star hotel  My room was quite small  I had a small and really old Zenith tv  This room was about the same size and age of a MOTEL  room  My girlfriend got a small piece of glass stuck into her foot when she walked on the carpet  They probably did not vacumm the floor  The king bed was comfortable and clean  My window faced the Hilton nothing spectacular  The bathroom was big but old  There was mildew on the bathtuband the sink had a fine hair crack  The pressure of water in the sink was so strong as someone has mentioned that  Water splashed everywhere if you not turned the water slowly  The towels were clean  Also no fridge in a  star hotel No wireless internet at my room  The staff at the check in was pretty nice  I did not try the food  The coffee maker was dirty  I The room was probably not sound proof because we were watching TV not too loud but someone was banging on the wall  The pool was being reated and they offered of using the pool of the next door Hilton for free By the way some other reviewers asked about the parking on the street  You can actually park near the hotel for free on sat after pm and sunday all day  I wish I had bought a French dictionary because the signs were all in French  So you need to know what days of the week  so the positive covenient location cheap pricenegative old hotel not very clean parking fee overated  I give it  or  stars 
P => Worked well for me Was quite satisfied with the Delta Centre Ville during my stay this week  Had a large comfortable room on the th floor for  CAnight with high speed internet access wired included  Bed and beddings were excellent    slept extremely well and the bathroom was larger and better furnished than other hotels Ive stayed in in Montreal at higher rates  Room or is perhaps a little dated and the nightstand was chipped in a few places but while the carpeting drapes and fabrics on the furniture certainly werent new they were clean and in good condition  Public areas were definitely s vintage design and or and the layout was a bit odd but not bad overall  Room service menu was a bit limited and the two meals I had were no better than average  A couple of my colleagues enjoyed their meal at the Tour de Ville revolving rooftop restaurant    I was too bushed to join them  The next time I come to Montreal to work with my client in Square Victoria the Delta Centre Ville will probably be my first choice for its location less than two blocks away and the excellent value in comparison with the other hotels Ive used nearby the riott Chateau Champlain and the Courtyard by riott on Sherbrooke  
P => Wonderful hotel highly recommended  Me and my husband went for the weekend in Montreal and we had a wonderful experience at the Delta Centre Ville  The location is perfect if you want to walk around in Old Montreal and Downtown  The room was super confortable and we had a stunning view of the city  We ate at the rotating restaurant and it was very good the employee were so nice and the food fabulous  The view of the city was breathtaking so romantic  We will come back with the kids for sure  The pool spa and fitness club were perfect as well  Overall the best experience we had in Montreal so far  
P => great location and good attentive service Loved their newly reated room with the white bed look    one of the best sleep sisce a long time  Great food and service at the revolving rooftop restaurant with fantastic views of Montreal   easy to see that it s a great location to walk to Old Montreal but also couple of blocks for shopping 
P => good hotel nice staff I dont understand the bad reviews here  Rooms were relatively modern and very clean  Nothing I saw in the hotel was shabby or old  Beds were comfortable  Staff except for a couple of waiters in the breakfast dining room  waitresses were all great were generally very nice and helpful  Pool area was clean and nice  Theres even a spa if you want a massage  All of this within walking distance of many of Montreals attractions old Montreal rue St  Catherine  Chinatown Would definitely stay here again  
P => Average but who s better at Montreal The hotel is a quite ugly seventies building from outside thus blending well with its surroundings and also the inside hallway floors looks quite seasoned I stayed in two different rooms both were clean good bed nothing broken  However especially the bathrooms are heading for their next remake at least so we hope Avoid staying in rooms facing the railway linemain road  The view is better than on the other side but it s considerably louder all night The ground floor restaurant is rather poor  Average food endless waiting at breakfast for the quotwait to be seatedquot lady  Minutes in a queue like in socialist Moscow   not even two star standard on this one The greatest plus are the staff Extremely helpful and friendly even with specialunusual requests  Check InCheck Out works swiftly In total value for money rather poor  Are there much better ones in Montreal 
P => disappointing stay at a boring and dirty hotel My  year old dhter and I accompanied my husband on a short business trip  We have stayed at Delta hotels in other cities and have found them to be bland and outdated but usually reliably clean and with good service  Our room at the Centre Ville looked like it hadnt been cleaned thoroughly in a while with mildew and mold all over the tile and peeling caulking in the bathroom stains on the wallpaper and bits of garbage in out of the way places ie chewed gum replaced in its wrapper under the desk  The bed had been made very lazily with the lower sheet not covering the mattress at the top and the blankets hanging out the bottom  The or was standard matching drapes and bedspread but falling apart and threadbare  We did find the service adequate and the lobby and common areas were clean and looked after  The pool and gym were great with a large clean change room lots of life vests for kids and a lifeguard who talked on the phone the entire timeThe restaurant breakfast was pretty bad the service was horrible only  employees that we saw looking after a  seat restaurant and there was a long line to get in the entire time we were there with tables sitting empty but covered in dirty dishes etc  The food itself was a mix there was a large selection of fruit yoghurt and breads but the quothotquot food was luke warm and not very tasty  For over  p p  it was a rip off  We checked out after the first night and moved to the SpringHill Suites a riot property in Old Montreal that was a HUGE improvement  To be fair part of the reason for checking out was we needed a suite to put our dhter to be early but we were also unhappy with the room and service at the Delta  We wont be staying there again  
P => Great Hotel  Friendly staff would recommend I stayed at the Delta Centre ville for a  day business meeting  Really loved the hotel  Staff is very friendly   Room was great and the bed was very comfortable     also had dinner one evening at their revolving restaurant on top of the hotel    highly recommend  great way to see the city     beautiful views   This is also a great location  located close to both old Montreal amp downtown shopping area    looking forward to go back  et 
P => Comfortable and well located Room was quite nice and was spacious and clean when we moved in  However on our second day the cleaner arrived at pm to clean our room We had been out of the room between am and didnt return until pm that day so they had plenty of time to clean it  We were only there two nights so I cant say whether this is normal cleaning routine  I wonder why she was so late cleaning it Dont they employ enough cleaners to go through the number of rooms they have Did someone quit without notice Was it an oversightOtherwise I was quite happy with the experience and would return to the Delta Centreville the hotel is well located everything was comforable and in good condition the rooms didnt smell of smoke smut or grrr horrible air fresheners we couldnt hear neighbours and the staff were pleasant helpful except for cleaning and informative  Like many hotels in North America there was no refridgerator in our room  
P => Wonderful Place for Families with Children We had a wonderful experience at the Delta Centre Ville on a family trip including me amp my husband our one year old son and an elderly aunt  We arrived after an abysmal experience at University Bed amp Breakfast and were lucky to get a pair of rooms at the Delta on a busy Labor Day weekend  Based on the reviews here I did not expect much from the Delta  I was very pleasantly surprised Our rooms were extremely clean comfortable and restful with amazing views  The restaurant was accomodating about providing milk or kid food chicken nuggets French fries etc at any time of day or night even when they were closed  The hotel provided a small refrigerator for our room to keep food amp milk for our toddler and our aunts medicine  The buffet breakfast was perfect with a small child and the waitstaff very patient and helpful  All of the hotel staff from the front desk to the concierge were lovely and accommodating for any request small or large  We enjoyed the pool and the childrens playroom which allowed one parent to sleep in while the other romped about with our son  It was easy to walk to many destinations from the hotel especially Old Montreal  I cant say enough wonderful things about the Delta    we all relaxed and had a great time because of their stellar hospitality For a great trip to Montreal with a small child all you need is the Delta Centre Ville and a sturdy stroller  With a rental car to get you to the Biosphere and other more remote locations youll be totally set for a good time 
P => Fine hotel Perfectly fine businessconference hotel in the centre of downtown Montreal near the old city and newer business districts  Stayed here a couple of times on businessconference  
P => Better for Business travelers stayed at Delta     in a premier room  This hotel is geared toward the business sector  Rooms are average but clean  Convenient from highway  walk to old Montreal can be a hike for smaller children  Families can do better elsewhere 
P => A Great Hotel My  sons and I went to Montreal for spring break  The hotel is in an excellent location  We walked everywhere except the Olympic Village  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable  We had an awesome view of the city from the th floor One one the BEST hotels Ive experienced  the breakfast buffet was top notch too 
P => Very Bad Experience My hockey team went up to Montreal for a hockey tournament  The hotel staff directed us to the parking lot across the street if you are looking out the front doors it is to the left  The first night one of our teams trucks was stolen with all of the players equipment in it  It is my opinion that the staff was aware of the routine car theft activity that we later found out is very common in that lot  If I had to draw an opinion I would say the staff probably tips off the thieves when nice cars come in and then take their cut  The bell men are agressive and grab your stuff quick to make a buck  The security staff was not at all helpful  The rooms are mediocre at best  The city is extremely dirty  The police took over a half our to respond when we cht some thieves in one of our cars after we posted our own security watch I wouldnt return to this hotel or Montreal ever again  In all our group had  cars stolen and atleast one other team had one stolen too  By the way I went to Montreal  times prior to this dating back  years  It was a beautiful city then but now its a dirty       
P => Pleasant We stayed for roughly two weeks and enjoyed ourselves  One of my traveling partners had a bit of an incident when checking in as the room that was reserved for her was taken  The bell person opened the door on a couple sleeping The hotel took care of her and the problem right away  They really went above and beyond  I would say its great for a group or those attending meetings  They seem to cater to business travelers  
P => Wonderful Wonderful This hotel is great Although some  stories tall you wait nary a minute for an elevator The hotel reataurant serves a wonderful lunch buffet something for everyone The rooms are spotless and comfortably appointed The staff is friendly and will bend backwards to fill any request you  have I stay at this hotel   times a year and it just gets better with each stay 
P => Good but not Great Ive stayed in this hotel a few times even back when it was a Radisson  It opened in the mid s as a Grand Hyatt  On the whole its not bad  The design on the outside is pretty striking not often you see a hotel where there might have actually been an architect  The lobby is nice too in a  storey atrium with the pool on top  Now to the rooms     unfortunately with that interesting exterior comes a strange interior  All of the rooms in the hotel are on odd angles  I stayed in one that was almost V shaped if you can imagine  This makes the rooms seem SMALL  You just know that if the building were a straight square the rooms would be bigger  The or is not bad could be more modern think mid s beige and green  However that being said its in a great location attached to the Victoria Square metro and near Old Montreal  I would stay here again they usually have good rates  Parking is pricey night  If you stay on a weekend you can park from Fri pm   Mon am for free on the street  
P => A good business hotel I stayed at the Delta Centre Ville for  days while organising a big conference in the Palais des Congres nearby  The huge hotel offers everything that you expect from this type   restaurant pool gym business centre etc  Of course nothing of the latest contemporary design   it pays off to be member of the Delta Preferred Guest scheme free of charge since you get an upgrade to the rooms on the upper floors and get access to a nice lounge on the th floor  Staff was friendly and professional nothing to complain about but also nothing to be hugely excited about  A good business and group hotel lacking some local charm  
P => Loved It My Fiance and I stayed at the Delta Centre Ville for six nights in ch   and would definately recommend it The staff were always polite and friendly   using both English and French when greeting you  The food was lovely   although a little expensive   we tended to go into the underground tunnels for our breakfast   which connect to the hotel  The rooms were clean and spacious with a newspaper delivered everyday  The swimming pool was clean and well managed   if a little cold at times  The revolving restuarant allowed a great view of the city at a price but worth it  Its a great location   within walking distance to both the shops which you can do entirely underground and the harbour  All in all a great stay  
P => Excellent location friendly staff I stayed at this hotel with a friend last month and we both LOVED the hotel  Granted to lobby  exterior is nicer than the rooms which werent bad by any means  Very insulated and quiet in the rooms  The pool was beautiful  There is free internetcomputer access in the lobby for under  minutes  Location was FANTASTIC   minute walk to old montreal  minute walk to downtown  Concierge staff was the best I have ever had  They were extraordinarily helpful providingmaps directions tips etc  This hotel made are first visit to montreal even better  I would suggest eating in old montreal or the Mcgill cafe less than a block fromt he hotel  I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to others  
P => Terrible hotel This hotel is desperate need of a face lift  The reception is OK but the rooms are old and tatty  The executive area means you get to pay high prices for self service drinks and a few nibbles whilst the internet access is via a single shared terminal The bar staff are rude and really couldnt care less about the customers even when you leave a ent sized tip which I always do in hope of getting faster service next time Ive had to stay here  times due to corporate policy but would now rather book a place  mile away and walk to my meetings 
P => not bad      Stayed ober      Id rate the hotel quotOKquot  I have no complaints but nothing special about it either  People were nice and helpful  I was attending a conference at the convention center a couple of blocks up the street  I would have probably chosen the quotIntercontinentalquot hotel in retrospect which is directly across the street from the convention center  Only problem with the hotel was the blow dryer in the bathroom is pretty weak  
P => Terrific A little pricey at night however executive class has its benefits including a panaramic view of the city and harbour both for breakfast and evening hors doeuvres incl  in the price  Rooms were nice concierge very helpful in arranging tours and sharing walkingrestaurant information  Located next to Old Montreal and just blocks from Ste  Catherines  Strongly suggest taking a tour bus as there is much more to see than these two attractions  Pool and balcony area were enticing but didnt take the opportunity to visit  The glass elevator provided a view and enjoyable ride  Be sure to ask for the corporate or govt discount if you are able  
P => BAD We had many problems with this hotel  While it is a beautiful hotel the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the service was poor particularily in the Tour De Ville restaurant  This hotel deserves  stars not   
P => Canada holiday Well located hotel excellent for the station easy to get to the St Catherine Street shopping area not impressed and the old town very impressed  Bedroom large and excellently provided lifts so speedy you are at the top before you realise all the while watching the city disappear below you through the glass window  Didnt find the lounge until our rd night tucked away round from the restaurant  Facilities in the hotel excellent  Our only reservation it is mostly geared to business and convention people  Otherwise very good would stay there again  
P => Great location and mostly no complaints from the peanut gallery I came to Montreal for Labor Day weekend with my boyfriend the long weekend also happened to fall over our  year anniversary    a nice plus and had originally tried to book a hotel in Vieux Montreal  When that fell through three days before coming we discovered that there were vacancies at the Delta Centre Ville  I was disappointed that we werent going to be able to stay in a hotel that had quotcharmquot like all the hotels in Vieux Montreal seemed to but when we arrived I was pleasantly surprised  I ided that the ameneties of a large hotel made up for any lack of charm  We parked the car in the lot here for  CADday I wonder if it would have been possible to park for free on the street and first checked into a perfectly adequate room with a king sized bed on the th floor for CADnight breakfast not inlcuded AAA rate  The only downsides to the room were that there was neither a refrigerator nor high speed internet access  The lack of internet was enough of a problem for us being the internet kies that we are that on the rd night of our  night stay we upgraded our room to a pretty much mirror image of the first room but with the all important high speed internet access for CADnight breakfast still not included  Steep but we were willing to dish it out  I was very pleased with the location of the hotel  Vieux Montreal was in easy walking distance as was Rue St  Catherine and the rest of that shopping district  While I wasnt all that impressed with the shopping district I really liked Vieux Montreal as it was the most remeniscent of Europe a characteristic of Montreal that I was definitely looking forward to  We only took advantage of the hotels very close proximity to the subway Square Victoria one day when we explored Plateau Mont Royal and Mont Royal itself  The architecture of Plateau Mont Royal was ho hum but the atmosphere and the shops and restaurants were great  We arrived at the foot of Mont Royal around  at night and got some great night shots of the city from the Chateau and then proceeded to get very lost in the very dark woods on the way down  However after a huge crazy detour we emerged mostly unscathed and are now back in the hotel for our last night  Overall the hotel was absolutely fine  No complaints aside from the lack of refrigeratormini bar in the room  I found that the staff were very friendly the bed was comfortable the bathroom was bathroom y and the location was most likely the best part of all  I wasnt   blown away by the hotel but I did love the one elevator that had a glass wall overlooking the city but neither was I sorely disappointed  I would stay here again sure  
P => Wonderful Place near train station Came in by train and was looking for a place near the station and this turned out to be a wonderful hotel within easy walking distance  Beautiful interior and one of the best meals of my vacation was at their restaurant  Room was very comfortable  
P => Panorama lounge made the stay worthwhile  Spent  nights at the DCV  Room was very comfortable and nicely orated with pleasant touches like a small cactus CD player etc  but was VERY small Thankfully it was a signature club room which allowed us access to the signature lounge     otherwise room might have been claustrophobic  The lounge was fabulous  It had a tv computer hot coffee etc  complimentary expanded continental breakfast and small evening buffet  Of course the best part was the view of the city  You can basically see all of downtown to Mont Royal and down to the old city and port  If you stay at this hotel I would recommend looking for a package that allows you access to this lounge  The package I got was less expensive for the signature club room than just reserving a regular room  
P => only tried the revolving restaurant  
P => A nice place for families  
P => Right in between St  Catherines and Vieux Montreal

P => Centrally Located and Very Good Value I spent two nights at the Delta Montreal and was very pleased with my stay  The first night was booked through a special rate with Expedia and the second night was booked at the last minute with the front desk  I stayed in a normal room the first night and an upgraded room the second night  The difference between the two include the upgraded room is a bit larger has an electronic thermostat mouthwash higher floors  bottled water nicer desk chair  Overall the furniture in both rooms was the same and overall pretty nice the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and spacious  The staff was very helpful with all of my requests  My only complaint would be that the rooms are oddly shaped and much of the extra space is useless  I would say this hotel is a very good  star and is in a great location  
P => Stay Away Ive been here  minutes and Im already regretting it   parking  internet and hotel needs an update through and through  I complained to the manager Caroline and asked for just one day of internet for free of a two day stay and she flatly refused  When you get customer service like that   not even offering a damn thing to make my experience better   you dont get repeat customers  Stay away  
P => Very satisfied good location and reasonably priced My wife and I stayed at the Delta on Rue Pres Kennedy for a weekend in late ust when we brought our son to McGill  The hotel is conveniently situated for anyone wanting to be close to the McGill campus  We got a rate of CDN so I thought it was a pretty good value hotel taxes added another   I would agree with other reviewers that the rooms are in need of some updates but I really couldnt complain about ours  It was large and on a high floor with a nice view the bed was fine and it was clean  We didnt use any of the hotel food service facilities or fitness center so I cant comment on them  Front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful  Overall I was quite satisfied  
P => DISGUSTING I travel quite frequently but still consider myself to be quite tolerant of most things  For instance I would never go to the tropics and complain about bugs in my room and I can overlook a hair that got left in the shower no problem  However I must say that the DELTA is at best a two star The lobby and conference rooms are refurbished and quite nice   but the show stops there  The rooms are disgusting  I was in a non smoking room that smelled like an ashtray and had over  ciggarette burns in the carpet  Not to mention the room was terribly outdated the fixures in the bathroom were chipped and scuzzy there was no fan in the bathroom even though there was a cover where the fan should be that was fallling out of the ceiling and covered with dustt fabric pills on the sheets and blankets  add all of those things up and it equates to a very poor experience  It was dirty smelly and just disgusting  There are great hotels in Montreal   this is not one of them  
P => Great hotel for the price The hotel is in need of some updating but had a great deal off hotels ca  The staff were very pleasant and provided great suggestions for dinner and were very helpful in booking our activities  The hotel had easy access to the metro and St Catherines street  The walk to the old city was a little longer but still very doable  The rooms were very large  A huge buffet breakfast every morning  
P => Modern clean great location quality weight room Travel zoo night  Id pay night for this one  King size bed had plush linen and pillows  Clean bathroom with strong water pressure  Large well maintained weight room with all the amenities of a good private gym  Parking was expsensive at over day  Friendly bilingual staff  This location is perfect for access to McGill St  Laurent St  Denis east end Montreal old Port etc    
P => Always a good stay one of MTLs best values On average my partner and I or with a group of friends treat ourselves to a weekend in Montreal once every two months  Amongst the numerous hotels weve stayed at I have to say the Delta continues to be one of the best choices when it comes to satisfaction as well as for price Id say that you REALLY DO get the  star hotel at often TWO star prices  For the best rate book with CAA and often you can change it for the quotlast minute ratequot ROOMSIve had the chance to stay in all  categories of rooms throughout different stays  While the pictures of the Delta rooms dont look all too appealing the room have recently been reated throughout the ENTIRE hotel so the Delta rooms and the Premiere rooms look EXACTLY the same The only difference is that the Premiere rooms are on high floors who cares All rooms have nice duvets and SUPER comfortable beds The Signature Club rooms have some nice added touches such as iPod dockspeakers and LCDs  All  categories of rooms are LARGE much more so than many other Montreal hotels  The bathrooms are your standard hotel bathrooms  The few minor issues Ive ever had here have been solved ON THE SPOT thanks to great staff  They have also ALWAYS been able to give us any requested extras iPod speakers CD player Fridge etc   Its in a part of MTL thats a short walk from shoppingnightlife or a cheap cab ride back after a drunken night out 
P => Outdated hotel not worth the price I have just returned from this hotel today  I am seriously disappointed in the facilities and rooms in this hotel  I was looking forward to enjoying the pool and kids room  The pool water is very very dirty it seriously needs to be changed it is comparable to slime  The changerooms are old and not very clean too  The kids playplace is a closet As for the rooms the beds and linens are very comfortable and clean  Unfortunately that was the only clean part of our room  The shower had mold in the grout which was re grouted in some areas the bathroom is comparable to a star I stayed in Cuba  Yes not very nice but in working condition  I found a dirty pair of socks under my bed not ours  The balcony looks dangerous to say the least  TVs are old tube ones arent flat screens affordable nowThe staff was friendly and the breakfast was great Warning to Montreal visitors there is a lot of crime in the city  We had our car window smashed and contents robbed after paying  for parking while taking a walk in old Montreal  The police said is was common  Note we were the only non Quebec plates in the lot and the only ones with a smashed window  
P => Very good but loud heater The hotel is a bit old but very clean and well managed  It is centrally located so it is easy to get to the Metro shopping and university  The underground parking was clean and bright  The only thing was that the heater was too loud whenever it kicked in we were woken up so we turned the heat down just before we go to sleep    Overall the hotel is great I would stay there again if when I visit Montreal in the summer  
P => Good Hotel at a Good Price This hotel is very centrally located  All the attractions are within a   minute walk or less  If walking is not your thing the metro is  blocks away  The staff was extremely helpful in suggesting places to eat and things to do  The indoor pool and hot tub are a plus for after a long day of walking its nice to jump in the water  The room was spacious although the tv could have been larger but who goes on vacation to watch TV Free internet in the rooms but you have to plug in your computer as it is not wireless  If you are going to montreal and want to be in a good location at a good hotel this is the place to be  I recommend it  
P => Kudos to the staff at this hotel they surely know how to please you My wife and I are seasoned travelers having traveled several times throughout Europe South and Central America  Therefore we recognize outstanding service when we visit a particular place  This month we spent  days in Montreal at this hotel  visiting Montreal and Quebec for the first time   I must say that we both were impressed by the professionalism of the staff at the Delta Montreal There were a couple of instances when we solicited assistance from the front desk regarding room matters  which as a general rule would indicate the quality of service degree of courtesy and efficiency offered by the establishment   In both instances they responded efficiently timely and with a high degree of sensitivity and interest in resolving the matter  Moreover they resolved the matters in a very professional manner without making excuses or attempting to shift the burden to the guest We hope to return to Montreal in the near future and we for sure will return to the Delta Montreal because we KNOW that their staff provides a five  star service at a reasonable price 
P => Great Location Clean and Free Internet   My second time staying at this Delta Location     Here are my thoughts ive been travelling for years and have spent a lot of time in hotelsPros  Location   st catherine street is very close all the shops nightlife walking distance from train station if you have a small bag place des arts metro is  min away  Free Internet is key for me and I think a lot of travellers      thumbs up for that   Accesible Gym with more equipment than   of the hotels out there     there is a pool    although the gym equipment is dated   you can still have a ent workout      Rooms are large and clean      Beds are very comfortable   in fact  i would put these beds up against the riott beds   very nice to sleep onCons  the hotel is dated     years ago it would have been in style but now its starting to show its age faded carpet tube tvs door handles on stairwell doors are falling off  elevators are slow  there are  elevators but you still end up waiting longer than you should have to for an elevator and normally they are fullThe above cons for me are not that big so I would stay here again if i get a good rate 
P => Centrally located but far from the nightlife Stayed three nights for NHL All Star weekend this past uary Pros Very good value for under  in the off season  Clean spacious rooms good soundproofing of walls  Super comfortable beds amp pillows both soft amp hard  Pleasant amp efficient staff  One block from Metro subway either Place des Arts or McGill stops  On the doorstep of the impressive Eaton Centre shopping complex  Six blocks from VIA central train station  Huge liquor store one block south though limited hours noon pm Cons Soundproofing of door to hallway is non existent  Expect to hear every door slam and drunken conversation in the hall thanks to extensive gaps around each door thus bring earplugs  night for underground parking  Pool area closes at pm even on weekends  TV has   channels with only a handful in English Tip While centrally located the area becomes a ghost town at night in the winter even on weekends  Need to walk  blocks west to hit the nightlife amp fine dining or  blocks south for Old Montreal  Any businessesrestaurants near the hotel shut down by pm Overall an enjoyable experience  
P => People make a hotel We stayed at the Delta Montreal from ust     It was an excellent experience  Our room was large clean and had a balcony  However its the staff at this hotel that sets it apart  The front desk people bent over backwards to make sure our stay was a pleasant one  House keeping people anticipated needs and asked if there was anything we did need Manon at the bar was a sweetheart and was very helpful with recommendations for our excursions  The concierge was always there and very knowledgeable amp helpful  I know it  sound like we have a share in this hotel However when you get adequate service these days it a relief  When fantastic service comes along  you need to tell people  
P => Excellent hotel around downtown We stayed the last weekend in y on short notice so we must have got a deal given the recession or something   for a signature room with free breakfast appetizers in the evening amp internet was a great deal Excellent service amp the room was immaculate but I think  days in a signature room is too much as we didnt have room in our stomaches for a nice dinner out on the town  The view was nice from the lounge on the rd floor but  a drink is a bit much  They did switch up the snack buffet a bit from day to dayWearflip flops by the pool if you can as the floor is slippery  Its nice down there though 
P => CleanComfortableAffordable   FULL   Star Hotel Stayed at this hotel this last Saturday ust st and everything was what I expected from a  star hotel   the real bonus was the price tx The room had  double bedsclean amp comfortable a big bathroomvery clean with a curved shower rod  a balcony with a GREAT view of the city  Not sure what previous poster was stating about this hotel being under reations   it is NOT   call them directly if you are in doubt  Yes the cost of parking is well over  if you park there   but you can also park right across the street indoors for   Please note there are TWO Delta hotels located in downtown Montreal the one we stayed at is located on President Kennedy  At this price I will be staying at this hotel whenever I need a room downtown Montreal J 
P => Clean and great staff  This hotel provided myself and my friends with a great place to stay  It is a bit pricey even with a corporate discount you are still looking at a good chunk of change with parking  But I have to say the view and the friendly service made the stay worthwhile  The rooms are clean and housekeeping is swift and efficient  I would recommend this hotel to any traveller who is on business  I dont know If I would recommend this hotel to someone who wants to experience montreal nightlife as you have to take a cab from this location and there are closer less expensive hotels located in walking distance to the montreal nightlife scene  
P => I would stay at Delta Montreal again I recently stayed at Delta Montreal for nightsI was there for a Chiefs Assembly for Quebec and Labrador The staff were very friendly an helpful My room was large and clean I appreciated the weather report left on my bed an the fact that it was addressed to me personally  This made me feel very welcome UnfortunatelyI was unaware that this hotel offered rooms for smokersI had to elevate to the main floor to smoke That I didnt like When I did learn that you offered rooms for smokers it was too late because they were all booked I was surprised that the signature lub rooms didnt have balconies an regular rooms did I personally think that the signature club rooms should have a balcony Overall I enjoyed my stay and would stay again 
P => Dated and Tired This might have been a very nice hotel at one point but the rooms are not there anymore  My room was huge but the layout was poor  The toilet directly faced a huge mirror  which is not the most desired arrangement  In the main part of the room there were two lumpy double beds an ugly concrete balcony a ancient television and a stained brown coffee machine  The rug had seen much better days and was stained and rippled  The room had miles of wall space but only one picture was hung and that was on a side wall  It was inhospitable and felt dated and unwelcoming  No wifi free or otherwise was available either not great for a business traveler  My colleague reported that her bed was short sheeted  On the plus side the lobby was pleasant and the staff were very friendly but I cant recommend the hotel  
P => Great location      stars Delta Montreal is a huge hotel with all types of guestsfamilies animal lovers couples business groups of young people etc  After reading trip advisor reviews we opt to stay in the signature roommost expensive and glad we did  We went through expedia and got   off since we booked for  nights  The rooms are in the top floors most modern w bedding and furnishing free internet and access to club room for computer useold but does the job magazines free continental breakfast and evening snacksalcohol pay extra which is fine BUT something not told until after you start drinking and many people were quite surprised about it and should be told up front  The food was good and perfect  The front desk are very nice  We asked for a corner room since many reviews suggested it for noise control and got it  Plus my dhter received a welcome gift which is always appreciated  The room was very comfortable and location is great Short walks to shops latin district  metro and McGill  Plus parking is right below and u can exit as often as u like  The kids activity room was nice but needs to be updated with books games and puzzles considering many pieces were missing and pages ripped  The down fall the noise from the hallway is bad  even with the corner room the noise level you can hear like the elevator people talking and opening and closing of doors  I was surpised by this  Since there is over  rooms in the hotel this wont be fixed anytime soon   And yes I agree w other reviewers if you have a party going on next door or even on the floor you might not get too much sleep  We were lucky and had no problems during the night  
P => A good quality central place to stay I stayed for three nights in    On checking in the staff were very helpful and fully explained the layout of the hotel and gave me map discriping the best way to get around I was on business and the downside was no free wireless access in rooms thought there is a business centre for guests with three dodgy old computers in it  OK for basic e mail checking etc The hotel is in a central location and everything within downtown Montreal is in easy walking distance I had a smoking room on the third floor with a small balconey overlooking the rear access garden and foutains  It was more than fine  I would recomend this hotel for a value break and for a short business stay 
P => A Nice Place The place was nice  Rooms were very good and Hotel staff was very helpful  I used the business center also  There was a charge for parking but I had anticipated that  
P => Nice clean hotel  I stayed at this hotel for one night on my way to Quebec City with friends  The hotel is in a good location  The rooms were a good size and very clean with modern or  The staff were very helpful and informative  They switched between English and French effortlessly and were helpful to individuals that spoken eitherboth languages They do charge additional per day for parking  However we were able to enterexit the garage throughout the day without any additional charges  They also charge extra for internet access  However these arent deal breakers by any means  After all I doubt that one can find free parking around Downtown Montreal for hotels that is  In addition I have found that many mid range hotels charge for internet which is unfortunate Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone that can find a quotdealquot on the price  I dont think I would pay regular prices  
P => Quite eiving    Stayed there for one night and tought that this Delta is a very average hotel  The room was pretty big but the king size bed we had was pretty old and the mattress had waves in it so you could see where people usually sleep    Not too good for Delta    Went down to the pool frigid water and the hot tub was out of service  I have to say that the breakfast ordered thru room service was good and the lady who brought it up was very friendly  This is a hotel I would skip next time it felt like it was a bit outdated  
P => Overrated hotel disappointed traveler The hotel looks good from the outside and the lobbies and halls but it is a ripoff and is behind the times in terms of amenities  Very annoying  While most hotels are giving away the Internet the Delta Montreal charges   per day for the privilege of plugging in your computer to the world  They also charge you   per local phone call which is bad enough but whats worse is they dont tell you that anywhere on the phone  You find out about it in a vague asterisk in the hotel room book  For the class of hotel they lead you to believe it is there should be a minibar especially since room service ends at  p m  and an in room safe  
P => Nice hotel with great service LocationWalking distance to Metro St  Catherine St  shops Bell Centre   min  and restaurants  Short cab to bus and train stations RoomsVery large clean room with balcony and windows that open  Rooms without balconies are smaller  Most comfortable hotel beds and pillows I have ever had Nice furnishings and bedding  Large bathroom although the old shower needed updating  The shower pressure was very low unless on cold  No big deal though  Some rooms are more updated than others  StaffVery friendly staff and quick to accommodate your requests  Our balcony and windows were bolted shut for children s safety but they opened them for us  BuildingVery nice lobby  Pool but we didnt use it I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again  
P => Comfortable stay in large room for excellent price Hotel Delta Montreal is nicely situated between lively St Catherine street and the hill Mont Royal  Quiet area of this large city we almost reached every site of Montreal on foot We stayed for  nights in a Premier Room which was on th floor  It was very spacy  Very comfortable double beds  But the carpet is old and need to be replaced  But I definatly would stay there again  
P => Good location good value   but minor annoyances We stayed at the Delta Montreal for two nights on Valentines Day weekend  The hotel was okay but there were many things I feel that will be helpful to others when iding to book  Downtown Montreal is a bit tough to drive in but as we pulled into the hotel the driveway almost looked like it wrapped around so you could leave your car there check in and then drive your car to the underground parking  No such luck     we realized that this wasnt the case and backed out and ended up driving underground to park the car before checking in  No big deal just a little hard to find this out until you pull in  The underground parking is currently under construction  Some of the cars arent parked in parking spaces and are parked along the sides of the wall  Just a bit tight but the worst part is the dust The cars were covered in it due to the construction  The dust even continued throughout the elevator from the parking levels into the hotel  At least this elevator is arate from the elevators used going to the rooms  The check in was very busy    there were about  people in front of us and within minutes there were  people behind us  The front desk staff were quick to take people so the line moved fairly quickly  Our room was on the second floor of the hotel and it appeared clean and well appointed  The bathroom or was a tiny bit dated but seemed extremely clean  The sheets werent put on the bed properly from the start so the bottom sheet wasnt covering the mattress and we got tangled up both nights when we were sleeping  It didnt appear that our pillow cases were changed on the second day  Overall we had a great time visiting Montreal and had a very nice Valentines weekend  The hotel was neither great nor horrible  Probably the most major annoyances were the underground parking due to construction and the bedsbed sheets  
P => Typical City Hotel This is a typical City hotel  It looks like a concrete tower block from the outside   but thats because it is Mind you   when youre watching where youre walking because of the heavy snow you dont tend to notice The rooms were clean   although the bathrooms could do with updating  Fresh towels were supplied every day   and the maid came in to make up the beds too  No kettle   just a coffee percolator   which is fine provided you like coffee tasting tea  We had the surprise of complimentary continental breakfast included in our stay   but for CAN we could upgrade to hot food as well which was amazing  Eggs bacon sausages French toast or pancakes freshly made waffles or omelettes made to your choice of ingredients  The hotel is centrally located for all the underground shopping malls and it is very easy to find your way around  Staff in the hotel are very friendly and approachable  
P => Horrible Stay We stayed there me and my wife from   th  to   th  and we had a room upgrade but guess what I am really wondering how the standard room are because ours were horrible  We chnaged the room four times because there is always something wrong with the room no lights in the bathroom very noisy heat system to the point you really cant sleep The Service desk is very poor and unprofessional they really need to learn about customer service and specially the managers there  I travel regularly and stay in hotels often in business but this one was my worst stay ever and i was very surprised because its the Delta  
P => Weekend in a fraternity house I spent the weekend of ember   at the Delta Montreal  Ive stayed there before  The rooms are large the beds comfortable and it used to be quiet  But this time I was woken up several times Saturday night by the noise of doors slamming loud lhter and yelling from  p m  until  a m  The hotel was full of young people partying  Saturday evening in the bar three young men got into a shouting match with another table  Four girls walked up and down the hall each carrying a bottle of wine and a glass  Three young men carried in a case of beer and assorted bags  Probably not surprising that even the nd floor one of the club floors was noisy all night with young people running from room to room and slamming doors I had a similar experience in  but thought it was an isolated incident  Obviously not  I will not stay there again  
P => Nice hotel but go elsewhere for meals Room was great   large clean comfortable beds coffee machine etc  No fridge in room  Nowhere to keep any drinks cold  No ice machine visible on floor Dining    breakfast EXPENSIVE  Most expensive Ive seen as this is usually the best deal for meals be OK if you have an expense acct but   for coffee is up there Same for juice    for continental  Dinner selections seemed pricey also  No small portions  be we should have shared one order    
P => Really nice hotel in a great location downtown I spent five nights here and found it to be an excellent hotel  Check in was very straightforward very welcoming  Standard room was very big with king size bed nice desk and chair armchair   also a balcony  Bathroom was also a very good size  Very clean and had everything one would want  Free wifi as well which worked exellently I only ate in the hotel once and that was for dinner in the bar on my first night there due to a late arrival  This was very nice too Would definintely look at staying here again 
P => Great night Me and my fiance had a great time in this hotel  The staff was a great help with telling us were to go in Montreal  The room was beautiful with a big bathroom  The view on the city was nice  Everything was clean  The parking is free and we could leave the car there until pm the next day no extra charge 
P => Good Location We only paid  a night which is a good price for this hotel  I definitely wouldnt pay the regular price of   The rooms are a ent size and clean  The beds are pillow top mattresses so they are quite comfortable  The bathroom is typical for a hotel  This hotel does have balconies which is nice  Some rooms have ent views if you are up high enough  The location is convient because you can walk everywhere  The only issues are the expensive parking at night and the elevators  There are only  for  floors so it can get a bit ridiculous having to wait if youre higher up  The pool gym and squash courts seem ok but we didnt use them  
P => Beware of crime Beware of crime outside this hotel  I booked a night here as a special treat for my college bound McGill U dhter  We parked on Rue Saint Antoine at  in the middle of the afternoon directly beside the hotel checked in and came out to find our car window smashed and a backpack containing all electronics including new laptop STOLEN  The staff was helpful in terms of cleaning out the broken glass but the police said this is epidemic  The following morning the police were in the Delta lobby taking a report from guests whose CAR HAD BEEN STOLEN  There is NO external security at this hotel and visitors are sitting ducks for anonymous property crime  I would not stay here again ever  
P => Excellent Long Weekend Stay The Delta Hotel was excellent  The room was well appointed clean great bed amp linens and nice balcony great view of Mont Royal  Moreover the staff was great and very accommodating  My partner and I had an excellent  night weekend stay  The hotel is outstanding and lived up to expectations  We paid a bit more for a quotSignature Roomquot which included access to a top floor hospitality suite for breakfast and happy hour  Both were worth the little extra in room rate  I must emphasize the staff were outstanding amp made us feel at home     amp made me remember why I love Montreal  
P => Good Hotel with a good location  This is a good downtown hotel on Ave  President Kennedy between the Place dArtes and McGill metro stops so it is very easy to get around the city or go to the Underground City  Plus bus   stops basically right in front of the hotel which can take you from the Olympic Stadium complex VAIU metro stop to the hotel directly  Also the hotel is about  blocks off St  Catherine which is good for clubbing and eating   The hotel is very comfortable and spacious in the rooms  Only complaint was there there is a  fee for internet in your room and there is no wireless in the lobby so you have to wait for the only two computers in the lobby to connect to the internet  This type of hotel should have the whole hotel wireless for free  Also there is no fridge in the room  We also opted not park at the hotel and found parking for  for  hours at  Universitie  parking garage which is about  blocks up  
P => Good Value for the money     The Delta Montreal is located squarely in Downtown Montreal and VERY close to the METRO and an easy starting point for just about any field trip you can imagin in Montreal  The hotel is clean well staffed and equipped  Overall a good value for the money depending on your rate HOTEL OVERVIEWThe facilities are good  Arrival was painless  First impression of the hotel was clean and well maintained with an attractive lobby area that was well ked with signs and easily managed with luggage  Parking was easy we self parked and came right up the elevator into the hotel lobby from the inside  Front Desk staff were pleasant and friendly and assisted with everything we needed upon arrival  We took up our own bags so bell service was not used nor offered oddly enough ROOMI was on the th Floor in a superior room smoking with two full sized bed room   The room was a good size for two people but I could not imagine a family of four being comfortable  The little balcony was great but it needed a could of chairs and a small table so your could enjoy it  I would have loved to sit out there and have breakfast and a coffee but there is not furniture out there  There was only one chair in the room due to the space limitations obviously  I think King rooms have two chairs  The photos are size misleading so that was a surprise  The overall impression was that the room was dated except for the beds  The green carpeting old style TV and mis matched falling apart lamps that were chipped and wobbly gave the impression of a motel or rather than a full service hotel  The furniture or and fixtures could use a soft goods upgrade  The bed was extremely comfortable so that was a nice surprise  The bathroom was dated as well with formica counters s sink bad lighting and tubshower combination  be Ive gotten spoiled but it also gave the impression of a motel bathroom utilitarian and clean but not much else  FACILITIESWe went swimming and used the hot tub in the pool area  It was clean well maintained and pleasant to use  I didnt use the gym part so I cant comment on that  We stopped by the spa and looked around  It was well staffed but a bit overpriced  CD for a manicure but if you need a service they have it available STAFFWe used the Concierge a few times but often his suggestions failed to impress  The first night we asked for something close and he sent us to an Italian restaurant around the corner  While close the food was not very good but okay  He was unfamiliar with a few restaurants I asked about Les Halles is one example  He also stated that the buffet at the casino was open  however that also was not the case as they stop serving at PM  One would expect he would know that as well as other details about major tourist attractions  He had to look online for restaurants ect  which lead me to believe he lacked personal knowledge of a good concierge and instead relied on the internet or a program to guide his suggestions The housekeeping staff and reception staff were all friendly and helpful  I was pleased on both ends with their service and friendly hello Overall I would return to the Delta Montreal but only if the rate was good we paid  per night AAA rate  They didnt WOW me in any particular way but they didnt turn me off either  I would only suggest they upgradeupdate the rooms to match the public areas of the hotel train their concierges and allow more personal experience with tourist areas and restaurants so their advice is from personal experience and not a computer program used to guide them  
P => Love the information Very friendly atmosphere  The employees were great  Very comfortable bed and quiet for sleeping  They have a excellent guide person to help you out with maps and information  I would stay again there  Nancy Gomula from Amsterdam N Y  
P => Great location for Jazz Festival After reading the reviews about the Delta I was uncertain about staying there or the Holiday inn which was next door  back entrance or back of building    weeks later I had not ide until  days before  The Delta is not a chain I am familiar with and was not interested in being disappointed   In the end I was not disappointed at All  Thanks to this site I knew the  computers downstairs would be in use most of the time  I knew Old Montreal was a  minute walk not  unless we were sightseeing along the way  The location was  blocks from the Jazz festivals  Do not worry about the noise  We heard nothing from our hotel room on the th floor  i think  The room had  double beds TV  chairs dresser and computer desk  Iron and board with suitcase rack  Bathroom was good size with thick towels and shampoos etc  Beds were comfortable enough to fall asleep with  pillows  The room had a balcony with no chairs but a used cigarette on the ground  There is no lock box  I did not smell any smoke in the room   so I thank whoever for smoking outside  The lobby restaurants and conference areas are well maintained and looks very well  I was pleased with the initial apperance of the hotel  We did not eat in the hotel because room service was EXPENSIVE  For breakfast we ate next door to the hotel    for   canadian    eggs home fries sausage or ham baked beens and toast with fruits and coffee or tea  The restaurant was in lotto building  You can enter it from sherbrooke diagonal from the hyatt coutyard  For lunch if you like indian food this buffet  Buffet Samrat will have you forget about your diet    for lunch    for dinner  STE Catherine ouest between clark and sturbain  For Dinner try the Fusion de LOrient in Old Montreal  St  paul est      they have fixed prices salad or soup main course and coffee or tea    Along with regular priced dishes  I do not remember if desert was included   besides we were too full to eat another bite  The service food presentation drinks were excellent  My server Peggy was polite and patient  Spoke perfect english for a native Montreal er  They searved seafood and other dishes  I was into seafood only and was not dissappointed You can walk up to Mont royal park from the hotel on Bluery to avenue du parc  No need for a car  we walked a lot  The subway was easy to navigate  The subwaymetrounderground was   block away entrance in Baie department store  The hotel was  plus their  taxes per night  Local and  calls are free if you sign up for a Delta priviledge card  Ther is a reasonable price Spa and a good sized fitness center  I did not notice the pool neither of us was interested in swimming over sightseeing  There was a boxing convection on the nd floor conference areas  However no fights were reported  The hotel is a  star because of the spa  You are close to shopping dining and everything you can imagine  Yes I would stay at this hotel again  I prefer the Omni Mont Royal but we cant have everything Happy travels 
P => Not Bad I was actuallly forced to stay here for a business trip so I had no idea what to expect when I arrived  It was very convenient for me because the conference was in the same hotel  I found that the staff was very nice right when I stepped out of the cab  My room was fairly large for one person and I had two beds to choose from  I cant say the bed was heavenly but it was ok to sleep in  I had a nice view of the city  The location of this hotel is walking distance to the main streets  I walked several blocks around the hotel and ran into several stores to shop in like the Bay grocery stores and plenty of restaurants  I did not really need a car since the reason for my stay was in the same hotel  It felt safe to walk around Downtown Montreal  Room service was quite pricey but the service is excellent  For business travelers there is a business center and internet hook up in the rooms  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great Location ProsHotel is in a great location    close to Metro stations underground shopping walk to Old Port  Montreal is small and easy to get around    no need to rent a car unless you want to go out of the city ConsRoom service is incredibly expensive    because of all the taxes amp service fees our  snack ended up costing   Better to ask for a refrigerator in your room  per stay and buy at a local grocery store  
P => A  nice  place     but definitely better places to be found Before heading out to Montreal we knew very little about the city other than what you read in guidebooks  We didnt know anyone who had been there so we made our plans as best we could The hotel itself is perfectly fine  Its basically an upscale Holiday Inn    clean comfortable moderately priced etc  Its located very close to the Modern Art museum as well as McGill university  While I have nothing bad to say about the hotel itself I dont think we would stay there again  The next time we go to Montreal and we loved the city enough that there probably will be a next time were definitely staying in the older part of town  Most of the really interesting sights are down there and while its not a bad walk from the Delta about   minutes a more central location would have been nicer  The Delta is very close to the main shopping district so if thats something youre into then the Delta would be a good choice  
P => Very Pleased with the Delta Montreal My wife and I stayed at the Delta Montreal from    to    in room   Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay here again About a week before we arrived I mailed the hotel a letter requesting a non smoking room on a high floor that was recently reated  When we arrived we got exactly what we requested the th floor was the highest floor for the type of room we stayed in  Check in only took a minute and there was almost no wait to check in at about  pm  The hotel was in a great location halfway between Mont Royal Park and Old Montreal and amidst all the large skyscrapers  The walk to Old Montreal was only about  minutes  The Place Des Arts subway station was a  minute walk down the street which we took to Casino de Montreal and where I won  playing blackjack yeah for me The room was very large and spacious  I could tell it wasn t reated yesterday but still looked very clean  The beds were very comfortable and had a large assortment of pillows  Our room had its own balcony  The television had about  channels to choose from which came in crystal clear  Half the channels were in French but they still had CNN TLC NBC CBS ABC ESPN Discovery a local Vermont affiliate and some other channels  The room also came with a work desk and some sofa chairs  The noise from the AC was very minimal and I was not able to hear any of the guests in the adjacent rooms  The room also had cordless phones The bathroom was nice but not spectacular  The sink had a lot of counter space and our complimentary shampoo conditioner and body lotion were replaced every day  The shower worked fine but the tub seemed a bit small  We had at least three large towels every day and about   smaller towels  The bathroom also had an extending vanity mirror We used the indoor pool and hot tub area every day  We did not go into the pool and preferred the hot tub instead  The pool water was a little too cold for my liking but I saw plenty of adults and kids swim in the pool so it must not have been too bad  I appreciated the fact that the pool area was open until  pm every night  There was also a fitness center and squash court that we did not use  There were also two computers available that had free internet access  There was a free newspaper every morning delivered to our door and maid service was excellent  The staff was friendly and helpful  We called for a Chinese food restaurant recommendation and they called us back within a few minutes  Everyone was polite and spoke English  There is a superket on Rue Bleury due east on the tourist map north in reality and a nice little bakery called La Patisserie Belge just one block past that where we purchased croissants and bread every morning  Across the street is a Second Cup Caf  the Canadian Starbucks that had a nice outside seating area  Be forewarned there is graffiti in the area adjacent to the hotel  Graffiti however seems to be rampant all over Montreal even on nice buildings in nice areas  Therefore don t think you re in a badunsafe part of Montreal just because you see a lot of graffiti  We felt completely safe walking all around Montreal day or night  There were some minor issues with our stay  The room did not have a refrigerator and we were not able to get a queen sized bed but two full beds instead  The pool water could have been warmer the windows on the balcony were not clean and they could have had a much better selection of tourist related information pamphlets  Only the even numbered floors had ice machines  The odd numbered floors had Coke vending machines  The carpets in the hallways need to be replaced badly  The restaurants in Old Montreal were a bit pricey  We recommend Peel Pub on Peel Street  The food there was very good very affordable and came with huge portions  If you re on a budget it s a great way to save money get a great meal and have leftovers to bring back to the room I do not know the exact price of the room per night as I purchased a vacation package on Expedia for  days nights roundtrip airfare for two from NYC fees and taxes for    I guess we paid less than   per night  This was not the Ritz or Four Seasons but it was a great value for a very good hotel  We would definitely stay here again  c T  Hardekopf 
P => Be aware Be aware that if you book through priceline you are only going to get smoking room  During checkin they are going to offer an upgrade to Deluxe non smoking room  I asked and was told they only have very few non smoking room available at Priceline com rate  I suspect they dont have any  Parking is CAD night over here  You can find cheaper parking if you drive around or street parking if you are over the weekend  Hotel is nicely located and St  Catherine street is walking distance  So if you plan to stay out and just sleep in the hotel this is good choice  
P => Needs restoration I stayed in the Delta Montreal for three days on business  My company booked it because they had negotiated a cheap rate On the positive side my room was large and had a nice view of McGill College and the hill above it  I cant comment on the location since I didnt get to go to any major sights but one of my colleagues kept saying that the quotreal Montrealquot was on the east side near Park Ave  but that we would have to drive to get there On the negative side the room really needed restoration  As other reviews have pointed out the carpeting was dingy stained and threadbare  The wallpaper in my bathroom was peeling badly  And several items did not work properly   beginning with a fairly important one the toilet  I actually had to reach into the tank to fix the stopper a couple of times before calling maintenance  I didnt like what I saw inside the tank   rust covered brown old  They sent someone up who fixed it but left ks on the floor from his shoes or tools  The bathtup faucet also had a slight leak  One other maintenance issue the hallway of my quotnon smokingquot floor th smelled of cigars The appliances also had issues  The TV had bad reception   most of the people sounded like they were speaking French Just kidding  Seriously the picture was fuzzysnowy on most channels  Finally the coffee maker took about half an hour to brew  small cups   I asked them to replace it but the next day it was just as slow so I think they forgot  Not the end of the world but when you need your morning coffee before a business meeting you dont want to wait  My only other complaint is that they wanted to charge me  to quotrentquot a small refrigerator  Ive recently stayed in riott hotels in London and New York th Ave  in Manhattan    where you would expect fees for everything    but those hotels did not charge me for this service so I would think a hotel in Montreal could be just as generous  Apparently not The hotel also was less than generous about its towels and soaps  My bathroom was stocked with only two bath towels and one bar of soap that was supposed to serve for both sink and shower One last thing The hotel boasts of a large workout facility and the picture on its Web site looks great but its really a very small narrow workout room with older equipment that is jammed together and the weight training equipment is arated by the aerobic equipment so if you get on the treadmill you have to watch the weightlifters pace back and forth in front of you to get to their various pieces of equipment  Not a big deal but just be aware that the workout facilities are not as expansive as advertised  
P => Overall a very nice hotel but the extras are expensive My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend trip to Montreal The ProsLocation is great close to all the excitement downtown  Service was also excellent we received good tourist type advice from the hotel staff and everyone we met in the hotel was pleasant  For night the room we had was great on a non smoking floor as requested  Nice pool and hot tub in the hotel and free copy of the Saturday Globe and Mail was delivered to our hotel room The ConsInternet access in the hotel room is not free which was disappointing  Parking at the hotel is  night which we avoided by using  parking at the nearby National Archive library  However because we couldnt pay for an entire weekend of parking at once we got nailed with a  parking ticket because we were delayed in returning to the parking garage to pay for the nd  hour time period  Still cheaper than using the hotels parking though  We also got billed   for a single local telephone call in the hotel room  Nothing comes free these days I guess  The only other issue we had was that our taxi driver from the hotel to take us to the biodome was very rude but Im not sure how closely affiliated with the hotel he was Overall great place just watch the costs for the little extras  Recommend that tourists learn somewhat of the subway system as its efficient and cheap and will take you most places downtown  
P => Very much in need of reations Unless you can book this hotel for  dollars and dont mind some problems it is better to pass on it  This hotel is several years past neeeding a reation   Worn and dirty carpets drapes and bedspreads make it feel like an old hotel from the s or s  We were given a room on the th floor but after I complained about the condition they moved us to the th  At least that room had new mattresses and the correct level of duvet and linens one would expect at a Delta  One of the worst hotels of that catagory in Montreal   
P => Very happy with our stay at the Delta My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend getaway at the Delta  We have stayed at Delta Hotel in Toronto so felt comfortable booking in Montreal  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and had a nice view of St  Catherines Street The location is great especially if you are looking to walk to Chinatown Old Montreal and St Catherines Street  Many restaurants and stores close by We will definately return 
P => Good Moderate Hotel We stayed one night in a room on the Club level  The room was very comfortable and nicely orated  It looked like it had been recently reated and because it was a Club room it had upgraded amenities and features like free wireless internet  The location was great right in the heart of the city but this made for expensive parking  It was abou day to park and the underground lot was always very full and very hard to park in because the spots were tiny  The front of the hotel wasnt very welcoming because there wasnt a driveway or anything so it was kind of awkward if you wanted to let passengers out in front because you had to just block traffic But good service good quality accommodations and great value for money  
P => Delta Montreal nice hotel great location Visited Montreal for both a personal visit and business  Very nice room   very spacious  A bit outdated but very clean large washroom  Most ammenties were up to date including the bed TV desk and furniture Pool and hot tub were good sized clean and were not crowded The location is ideal as it is only a three block walk to both McGill and Place des Arts Metro stations  Very close to McGill University as well as Ste  Catherine Street one of the main shopping streets Staff were friendly and fluently bilingual  Small tuck shop Would definitely visit again  
P => Honnest We found a great price on Travelzoo for a room on the executive fllor with breakfast and happy hour  We liked the hotel great location friendly service and advice clean room    But we agree with the other review be aware of the parking do not pay it through the hotel  
P => Good Hotel but needs to be moderized The Delta Montreal is a clean hotel that offers great service and a very friendly staff  It is located within a block of the subway and is central to most things that tourists would want to do  The staff is very friendly and helpful  The hotel is getting up there and can use alittle moderizing  I stayed in the club floor and had a great view of the city and of Mont Royal  It was a great experience and I plan on returning in the spring  
P => Great Hotel Great Location Great Deal I think the other poster followed my lead on the Priceline bidding but I was a little more lucky and satisfied  I bid and won this hotel for  with tax and fees  It was a total steal  I went to check in they only had smoking rooms and I was too early anyway  However when I came back a non smoking room opened up and I got it Anyway location is really good   right behind the Bay   they had a great lounge pool and workout room  My room was on the sixth floor no balcony nice view lots of room good toiletries and very clean  The furnishings werent very new but for  bucks who cares Finally I found indoor parking nearby for virtually nothing  Overall a great experience  
P => smokey floor Booked a room there on Priceline for US all tax included  The location is great close to McGill and Place des Arts Stations walking distance to Ste Catherine and Mont Royal Park  The gym was a plus so was the pool However for the price we paid there was only rooms on the rd floor the smoking floor  And let me tell you it reeked  At first it wasnt too bad but after a while it became a bit sickening  For  more we could have been on the higher floor The room itself was ent the bed very confortable and the bathroom clean  No complaints  So if you are sensitive to smoke dont hesitate to pay the  extra for the upgrade  
P => Cheap Price and Quality my room was run down but clean  I got a great price last minute over Labor Day weekend  Friendly staff  Very large room centrally located  
P => Great deal Very nice sized rooms huge bathrooms  Close to all attactions but very quiet  Very clean with exceptionally comfortable beds Only downside it is becoming dated could use an update but great deal for the price  
P => Fine hotel in a central location Stayed at the Delta Montreal t    Booked via Hotwire for a cheap rate and ended up with a th floor room  I could have paid an additional night for a upper th floor but chose not to I was given once of the smallest according to the evacuation map on the door room which was still quite large  No balcony but giving on a quiet street and I was at the end of the hallway so it was very quiet  Very large washroom and  double beds  The sheets are standard hotel style nothing fancy like in the upper reated room  But still fine TV was fine with about  channels and there were  phone one of which was cordless Did not have any meals at the hotel  I had breakfast at quotChez Coraquot a few blocks away for amazing crepes and eggs Location is great right behind the Bay  Parking is  day  Park elsewhere if you can  
P => Stay on the   floor for a treat  Due to last minute travel arrangements I stayed in two different rooms at this hotel  The staff offered to arrange for me to stay in the first room for the week but I was curious to see what the upgraded business room was so I opted to change rooms  All rooms have a balcony looking out over the area which is a great touch  The first room I stayed in was was on the th floor  I had a non smoking room with a king sized bed  There was a dresser TV cordless phone clock radio robe iron and board bottled water chocolates on the pillow weather card on the pillow to let me know how it would be the next day  There was also a desk wtih a lamp and office chair I went for the buffet breakfast the following morning  It reminded me of a resort breakfast with plenty of fresh fruit cheeses hot waffles with maple syrup eggs meats cold and hot cereals fresh juices teas and coffees The second night I was on the st floor  The  to the rd floors can only be accessed by room card in the elevator  Those floors have access to a help yourself breakfast on the rd as well as happy hour snacks from   pm  Drinks are extra and billed to your room  The breakfast here was fresh juices individual tea and coffee yogurt waffles with maple syrup fruit cheeses and pate  It was plenty for me  If you are a growing teenage boy and want a big big hot breakfast you  want to go to the buffet  I liked the quiet of the rd floor  There is a table on the balcony for you to use when the weather is pleasant  This breakfast is mostly business people reading their paper or quietly texting The second room had a larger washroom with extra items like body wash  The main room had a sitting area with two chairs a small table and desk  The office table was large with a comfy office chair lamp and a bamboo plant  It was a lovely room  I received a Globe and Mail in the morning  There were two cordless phones alternating chocolates or truffles on the pillow weather card nifty iPod capable stereo alarm robes iron and board dresser I enjoyed both rooms and do recommend staying there  The regular room was great and you will be happy there  Give yourself a treat and stay on the  rd floors for upgraded features breakfast and happy hour snacks  
P => Great Location  We booked this hotel through Hotwire so the price was greatly discounted making this hotel a fantastic value  It could easily pass for a  star  The good Pleasant and helpful staff clean spacious and comfortable rooms balcony front desk open  concierge service free computers with internet access open  as well Spa with various facial and massage services available above average fitness center this one is loaded with cardio and weight machines not your typical chain hotel fitness room  pool is a salt water pool much healthier alternative to chlorine there is a nice child play area in the Spa and best of all the location is superb within walking distance from many of the hot spots one block from great shopping a few blocks from the quotunderground cityquot one block from the subway  The bad Since our room was discounted through Hotwire we didnt have a choice of smoking or non and we were not advised of this until we arrived  Thankfully they had a non smoking room available because we got there early PM  There are only  computers in the business center and they are busy a lot of the times the breakfast buffet was way overpriced  for  and the food was below average the fitness center had lots of newer machines but was a little cramped  Overall we had a great experience there and highly recommend this hotel especially if you can get a discounted price  
P => Enjoyed the stay We got a great deal for night two doubles and a free upgrade higher floor free high speed internet  and     check in was quick parked in the basement for   canadian night    I agreed with the reviewer before me    they couldve done something more to the balcony    its all gray    why didnt they put a coupla chairs and a table or something The worst thing was that the bathroom drain wasnt working so whenever we showered the dirty water just pooled at our feet  Since we were only staying two nights we didnt want to change rooms pack and move    oh yes theres no fridge     that sucked    we just used the recycling bin and filled it up with ice    
P => central location makes up for any shortcomings Do you ever visit a hotel and think quotif they only changed it a bit it would be much better    quot Thats how I feel about this hotel Very clean hotel great spacious rooms  Bathroom had everything we needed  Great central location  We walked everywhere  Close enough to the shopping streets the outer neighborhoods a superket and cafesrestaurants  Newspaper in front of the door complimentary bottle of water daily  The TV was fine Heres the quotif they only changed itquot partThe hotel quotspaquot was nearly a joke  We particularly chose this hotel because it had a pool and hot tub  The pool was salt water which I still find a bit weird and a bit too cold  They had a sauna which was lukewarm at best  The hot tub was not hot at all and the jets didnt work  It would have been ok be not really if theyd just said quothot tub out of orderquot but they said the first day wed gotten there that it would be checked by an attendant  I even got a call from the manager later that day that it was fixed  We tried again  It wasnt fixed  Another afternoon we wanted to take a quick swim between sightsseeing and the pool was close for a couple of hours as they were having a water aerobics class for spa not hotel guests members  What kind of     is this That is totally the wrong way to treat guests  At that point either complain complain complain or let it be and move on  We let it be  Next time we wont be so nice Heres the easiest way to fix a hotel like thisPut a bowl of fruit in the lobby for guests  Trust me it would have made us happier  Have your staff acknowledge the guests when they come and go  Thats a no brainer   And if there are two guests in the room have  bottles of water    And if every room comes with a balcony would it rock the budget to put a chair or two in the balcony There was nothing there just a place to stand     And its great that they have clock radios but ours was probably about  years old  And if you advertise a spa make it good Other than that enjoy Montreal  Its a fun pleasant city to visit  
P => Cannot beat the location   plus good quality We stayed at the Delta in ust which in my opinion is the best time to visit Montreal  The students havent arrived quite yet but the businesses are gearing up for their arrival and the weather is great  There is an air of anticipation in the city   I had never been to Montreal before  It is not quite the Parisian outpost you might have heard it is but it does have a French flavor  You can watch the Simpsons in French and then watch the Simpsons in English an hour or two later There is even a soap opera on television every day at  in Italian and some Italian programming to entertain the Italian population  This hotel is in a great location  They give you directions to walk a few blocks and you can   but those are very large blocks Luckily there are some lovely Metro stations nearby and you can get everywhere by Metro  The room was very spacious  We had two double beds  Not the dreamy comfy mattresses that we recently slept in at the riott in New York but comfy enough to get a good nights sleep  The bathroom was also very large and the water pressure good and the water hot   We worked out in the fitness room which was perfectly fine  We did so much shopping excellent shopping and sight seeing that I didnt have time to try the salt water indoor pool at the hotel but I could see that there was almost always a guest there swimming laps  The hotel restaurant looked good but as most hotel restos a little pricey  We went out for breakfast lunch and dinner  Montreal has thousands of restaurants and I wish I had the time to visit even a tenth of them Some criticism the room did not have a safe  The carpet was a bit rumpled  We had a balcony with a view of the city but it seemed a little bit old though sturdy  The view was spectacular Lots of skyscrapers yes but also the hills in the distance and several interesting buildings that were not skyscrapers  Very dramatic at night  There was a coffemaker in the room something I always appreciate along with the free Globe and Mail newspaper delivered to the room every day  The lobby had the Montreal daily newspapers both French language and English free to guests  There was also a magazine kiosk in the lobby   It was a very pleasant stay  I appreciated the dining suggestions from the concierge La Caveu down the street and Blanc a few blocks over  We enjoyed both restaurants and would not have known about them otherwise  The clientele is international   I met Italians Germans and Englishmen in the elevators  
P => Great Location ent Hotel The beds were comfortable and the room was spacious and clean  The hotel staff was nice and were fluent in English  The only downfall was that the elevators were very slow  I believe that there are only  elevators for the  plus floor hotel and it tends to get congested in the elevator waiting area during peak times of day  I had meetings at the Convention Center and it was only a short walk  
P => Good Stay  Great location This is the third time I have stayed here and I will be back Check in is quick and easy staff is very quick to help you out with directions or restaurants reccomendations  Housekeeping kept the room spic and span yes it is an older hotel starting to show the age but it is kept up very well  The rooms are quite large and very clean  I find the beds to be on par with The Westins heavenly beds and slept very well for the week I was there  I never used the restaurant not the gym so can not comment on those  sorry  Location of this hotel is stellar  So close to St Catherines and a quick cab to Old Montreal  
P => Nice place wfriendly staff    but two BIG flaws need to be fixed    Overall this is a nice place    you get what you pay for  The rooms are quite spacious which is a nice change from hotels that cram every open area with either more furniture or a wall so they can put in another room  The staff were very friendly and did what pretty much every other human being does if youre friendly to them theyll be friendly to you  Im betting that a lot of the people posting reviews who had evil staff experiences engineered a lot of the tension directly or indirectly The location was great    very close to either McGill or Place Des Arts Metro stations  Unlike Toronto the Montreal metro is extremely convenient and very well planned i e  you can actually use it to   go places that you want to go  There are only  real problems with this place  The self described quotBusiness Centrequot isnt  Its a couple of very very dirty desktop computers in a room that is actually smaller than the hotel room  Its not a centre at all    its more of an quotinternet kioskquot like the kind youd find at the library  This is probably okay if youre just checking your email but if you actually want to conduct business then dont be fooled by the title of this little room  You will be unable to conduct any real business here so dont count on it   The idea that you have to pay for in room Internet is as TACKY as it gets  I have actually been in hotels in the rd world    places where most people couldnt afford a laptop if they saved for years    that offered free wifi  Why Because its just a basic staple  Its not a luxury anymore    its as basic as a telephone or TV cable  This hotel however weasels around this and charges something like  a day for Internet access  Why Not because they have to offset the cost    their Internet cost is fixed like their TV cable  Theyre charging it because evidently its a cash cow and people are willing to pay  This is just tacky  Overall  a day is very little but the idea of it lingers    its just bad PR and Delta Montreal should be ashamed of this  By the way for those of you who have the Rogers portable wireless it works very nicely from the hotel rooms  
P => Delta Hotel is very convenient We have stayed at the Delta many times  It is especially convenient to McGill University where our dhter was a student for  years  She has graduated and is no longer in Montreal but we chose the Delta again any way  It has free internet in the rooms We had a king size bed with many pillows and a fluffy comforter  It is clean and well kept up  It is a reasonable walk to Vieux Montreal and everything we wanted to do  In addition the Metro is very convenient  We will stay there again when we return to Montreal  
P => Delta Montreal    Good location comfortable room The Delta Montreal is a well located property  Rue St  Catherine Crescent Denis Laurent and Vieux Montreal are all within walking distance  The rooms are large for this type of quotchainquot hotel and each is uniquely shaped in an angular fashion to make the most of the space and large windows  The room had two chairs one being a wheeled desk chair that reclined  There is a patio on each room but it is just a concrete slab  Linens were fine in our standard room however the deluxe rooms do have better plush comforters  The bathroom was rather large but nothing fancy  There were a few spots on the fixtures and door hardware showing the propertys age  However housekeeping was fantastic and the room was spotless each day  The fitness center and aquatics facility do leave something to be desired  The hot tub jets did not function even after visits by the maintenance staff  The salt water pool was nice but is more suited to lap swimming than family vacations  There were times that the pool could not be used by hotel guests as aquatics classes were taking place  The pool showed much wear and could use a sprucing up  There is no real concierge so if you are in need of those services you  wish to stay elsewhere  The front desk and bell staff were helpful  I recommend this hotel if you want to be close to most of the city neighborhoods and want a clean comfortable hotel with a pool  Those looking for special pampering or a charming property should probably go elsewhere  
P => Solid Hotel   Will Stay Again Having read mixed reviews from other posters I did not know what to expect But I was pleasantly surprised  We had two doubles for my family of four  The room was a good size and clean I called housekeeping upon arrival to request an extra set of towels and it was in the bathroom when we returned to the room later that afternoon The bathroom was also a good size  But be careful the hot water is scalding and the water pressure is strong as I found myself getting water all over the counter There must have been some construction next to the hotel in the past because a new condo just went up but it has been completed We had breakfast at L Aroma it was the standard eggs bacon sausage pastries cereal and fruits buffet The hotel does not have a concierge desk but the valet and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful The room did not have a mini barfridge but there is a superket close by one block east and one block north    Provigo  with reasonable prices  We actually got a rotisserie chicken there and ate it in our room The gym and pool were the standard size for a hotel some free weights some weight machines and a few treadmills  It also had  squash court  We did not try the pool but apparently they have converted it to a salt water pool it is supposed to be less harsh on the skin I was disappointed with the size and quality of the children activity centre  The centre is part of the gympool area  It is about  square feet big with a Nintendo some books puzzles cars and stuff animals  All of the books were in French There is an outdoor playground with a slide and swings but it s opening coincides with the terrace season y and ust The closet metrosubway stop is two blocks away Place des Arts Walking to the Old Port takes about   minutes It is very close to stores on Sherbrooke and Ste Catherines I would definitely recommend this hotel to others  It is a solid   star hotel  
P => Well located horrible concrete tower From the inside nothing special  The room was large and of acceptable comfort  From the outside its one of those s s prefab concrete monstrosities that have defaced Montreal and Sherbrooke Street West in particular and many other cities  It is centrally located but a wind swept canyon of very bland modern buildings  
P => Very ent I really enjoyed my stay at the Delta  My mom and I were able to check in at pm  Nice room with  double beds with fluffy quilts  pillows very comfy  We had a seating area around the TV with  chairs  The balcony wasnt great just a concrete floor but it was nice to open the door and have fresh air  The only thing we didnt like was the loud fan in the bathroom that turned itself on with the light switch  So we brushed our teeth in the darkWe ate all our breakfast at the buffet was included it was very ent  Lots of fresh fruit and cheese  We ate once at the Cordial resto bar food was excellent  Used the hot tub and salt water pool not huge but enjoyable  It wasnt crowed  They have a little room with  computers and free internet  The hotel is surrounded by subway entrances Place des Arts and Mc Gill   blocks be  minute walk if so  Not too many restaurants around the hotel was a bit disappointed but the subway is great to go everywhere  They have a  day pass for  or weekly for   I would recommend  
P => Nice hotle for both business and Spring Break I stayed at The Delta Montreal in ch of  for spring break  The hotel staff was very helpful and courteous the room was spacious and since they overbook the premiere rooms the gave us free high speed internet for the length of our stay  Nice pool and the spa staff are very nice to  Great price as well  
P => Love the home sens and location I had a small business trip t attend and what a home coffy hotel  I felt like at home and treated so nicely by the staff  The bar was perfect for a nice cold beer with a cossy atmosphere brought a client with me and he said never klnew about this bar  I am sure he will go backWill definetely go back 
P => fine hotel good location and value My husband and I stayed in the Delta Montreal for a long weekend at the end of ust  I had read a lot of the negative reviews on here and was a bit worried about the state of the hotel and rooms but I have to say that we found our room to be clean in good repair and comfortable  The bed and pillows werent the most luxurious but everything was clean  My husbands main complaint was that internet was available only for a fee in the room they do have free internet in the lobby but there are only  computers so you often have to wait The construction next door was a bit annoying so early in the morning but that wasnt the hotels fault  We found the staff to be helpful and had no problems with them We didnt eat at the hotel for breakfast we asked for suggestions from the bellhop and were directed up the street to the local branch of Chez Cora which was delicious and worth the short walk The best thing about this hotel is its location    you can easily walk to the subway and to many attractions All in all a fine hotel especially for the deal we got on Expedia  
P => Dont bring the wife   and definitely not the mistress Once you get over the chipped hand basin in the bathroom the broken thermostat the fact the room had not had a thorough cleaning in years the inadequate phone service the cheap bed linens the cigarette butts on the balcony the tired furniture and the dull or   then his hotel is not that bad a place to stay for a business person on a budget  Food service in the restaurant at breakfast was fast and efficient you could open the windows in your room to let in fresh air and they provided a bottle of water free of charge  Location is also pretty good and parking convenient  But if youre bringing the wife along then take her somewhere more romantic and presentable such as the Sofitel or Hotel Vogue  Its worth the extra  
P => Great hotel We stayed at the Delta Monteal for  nights with our  sons ages  and   Our room standard  doubles on th floor was large with  comfy chairs to gather around the tv  The kids liked the irregular shape of the room  The balcony was neat although it was too cold to use it   also no furniture on it as has been mentioned elsewhere although be they bring it in for the winterThe pool appeared clean and was warm according to the boys  We had room service  times and everything was fine  We only ate one meal in the restaurant breakfast  Our one complaint was that we had chosen the Delta in part because of their advertised childrens activity room  The childrens room was a let down fairly empty save for some blocks and toddler toys plus a Nintendo which my boys didnt use bc we brought ours from home The room is part of the spa area so seems more like a parking place for kids while parents work out The location was great   very close to the metro and St  Catherine street  Our check in process went very smoothly  Wed stay here again  Parking was day   and the day we checked out they told us we could park there until  pm which was nice  
P => Good hotel for the money This hotel is centrally located in Montreal within walking distanceof the Old City and other attractions  We received nice and quiteroom  Staff was very friendly and helpful  Remember this is not a new hotel and needs some updating Booking thru Hotwire we found the price very low for a hotel this class  The only negative the price of parking is little on the expensive side  If you want to be within walking distance where all the action is this hotel is for you for the right price  
P => Delta Montreal better than most My husband and I stayed here for the weekend to do some shopping  We lived in the city for  years and have stayed at several hotels and know where to come back to  Very friendly staff good location spacious rooms we stayed in the premier rooms on the top floor  Great value for the money  Would recommend to everyone  
P => No complaints good ision after reading Trip Advisors reviews Montreal is a very expensive city  The Delta hotel is a great deal  Of course it has its trade offs but if you read carefully what other visitors have written here you can easily avoid them I stayed at the Delta for one night  This is not my first time in Montreal so I know location already makes this hotel a great catch  I got a deal on Hotwire and following the advice given by a previous visitor I accepted the  dollar upgrade offered at the desk We got a very spacious room on the th floor super clean quiet with a nice view to other office buildings thats all there is to see   Staff was very friendly  I would stay there again  
P => Good Value but some issues We stayed at this hotel for  days and  nights  For those who want the skinny it s a good hotel for those on a budget and those with kids  There were a few issues hence the title but overall the stay was ok This was our first time in Montreal  As African Americans we felt very comfortable There are tons of hotels to choose from  We got a great deal from Atlanta Hartsfield for  at just under   The goodThe Delta Montreal is close to Place De Arts Metro station and near the area were most festivals happen  Only  block from the Jazz festival we walked most everywhere  The place has a good size gym swimming pool indoor racquetball court and hot tub  There is an indoor and outdoor play area big enough for the most excited child  The staff is friendly and will practice French with you  There is even an office center with  internet ready computers  My wife got a rub down at the on site spa and I played some play station in the room  The rooms are a good size with access to a Terrance The BadThe room had not been fully cleaned when we got to it  We called and they re did the room though  The hotel seemed older so on the nd night we got a note indicting all water would be shut off from pm to am for repairs  Good thing I dont get up at night much  I m getting into football soccer with the world cup and all but the cable went out in the entire hotel the day of the game and never came back on  They did open the suites to allow guest to watch the game  It would have been better in my room  China town is a joke  Go there for some shopping and only if you like Vietnamese food  Nickels is like a Denny s only better tasting   Last Montreal is growing and there is construction everywhere  We got a room next to a building going up  They started at am Mon Fri  I guess every place has its faults but all things considered Delta Montreal is probably one of the better hotels for the price  
P => Good location but     We stayed a week in the Delta on President Kennedy Ave  The location is great but the hotel needs some work  Like the phone in the room that didnt work nor the coffee pot nor the parkade exit gate about  of the time  Add to that peeling wallpaper in both the bathroom and bedroom areas  We booked and paid in advance through Expedia but were informed upon check in that the hotel was overbooked and that we would have to be quotshuffledquot to another hotel by taxi  We insisted that they find us a room and after an argument and waiting while a manager was consulted they offered an upgrade a higher floor at night additional  We were also told that our room was quotnot guaranteedquot because it was booked through the Internet  Again we insisted and they eventually relented  We have let Expedia know we had a problem too  The hotel is in the heart of shopping night life and restaurant district of a thriving Montreal  The hotel restaurant and bar are both nice and the food was good     expensive but that is true wherever you go here  A cocktail was   and a glass of red was   Welcome to la belle province 
P => Go for the upgrade We stayed here for two nights  We were offered the Signature level for  more per night which included reated room free internet deluxe continental breakfast buffet in the lounge free coffeeteapop and happy hour each evening with finger foods nachos fruits cheeses etc  Just be aware that the beer wine and liquor is subject to a quotminibarquot charge  They should have a small notice with the prices next to the food  The attendent was informing guests on ad hoc basis about this policy  Parking at the indoor garage across the street NW sidewas    hrs but only  on weekends taxes included  The hot tub jets were rather feeble old age yrs was the reason given  Bellagio is an excellent Italian restaurant classy but reasonable one block from hotel  
P => good location good location  near all shops good bars  university etc  Internet access downstairs No contact with desk staff but nice staff in food parts and good rooms  clean and central Go to the jazz bar around the corner very good Would stay again  good value for money Nice food breakfast etc very happy with location  No need for car as very interesting places within walking distance  
P => Bravo Delta Montreal Just spent a week in the Delta Montreal and LOVED IT     Our room was on the th floor with gorgeous views of high rise buildings  We had a king sized bed a well appointed lounge area with tables chairs and bureaus    as well as a desk area  We took coffee on the balcony     and wore plush white bathrobes provided in the room It is one block from the Metro line which connects you to all of the city  Or if you feel like walking the shopping district is three blocks away The staff was courteous and attentive  We travel extensively all over the world     and would rate this a very fine four star hotel   Bravo Delta Montreal 
P => A dump I have stayed at the Delta several times I come only to work  The IT system is a disaster  The internet works about   iof the time and they have the gall to say that quotthis is the first time that   quotLast week their excuse was that quotwe have to fly in a spare part from Torontoquot which does not say too much about the state affairs is The air conditioning is erractic the elevators are slow All the signs in the levator are in French so u need a refresher before you board the elevators   if they ever come  I waited about  minutes each time to get one This is probably the worst business hotel I can ever remember having stayed in  
P => Dont Confuse with the Delta Center Ville The best thing to say about the Delta Montreal is that if you are attending the Montreal Jazz Festival it is only a two block walk    very nearby  We did go to the jazz festival this year with our children  The festival was wonderful but the hotel was a disappointment  First of all what I had read about the Delta Montreal made me think that it would be a fancy tower of a hotel  Apparently that hotel is the Delta Center Ville  The Delta Montreal is an older more modest hotel in which we had several problems  Just prior to our arrival I noticed on their website that the room rate being quoted for an quotupper level premier room with free internetquot was significantly less than what I had received when I originally made my reservation a few months prior  So I telephoned the hotel directly and asked about the price difference  I was told a manager would call me back but no one ever returned my call  So upon our arrival I brought a print out from the web page with the lower rate  The desk clerk was happy to quotadjust my ratequot to the lower rate for all five nights of our stay  I was very pleased with the correction  But what I came to discover was that the way my rate was quotadjustedquot was by putting my family in a lower level room with no free internet access no view and no balcony the hotel claims that most rooms have balconies  At first I was not going to ask for a change because our children had already unpacked all their toys etc  But the next morning came another unpleasant discovery    if anyone left the bathroom door open after showering then the smoke detector was set off by the steam in a loud startling alarm  So I called the front desk to expain the series of unfortunate incidents and request a new upper level nicer room  I was told that they could move us but only for the original much higher rate  When I tried to explain that their website was making reservations for the better rooms at the lower rate the clerk told me that I would have to prove that with a confirmation number  I was so aggrevated but I ided to let it go and try to ignore the problems for the remainder of our stay  We learned to keep the bathroom door closed  be I have become accustomed to a level of service in the US that is not part of the culture of Canada  I never did feel that the service at this hotel was excellent in any area  We did eat in the hotels restaurant Aroma three times  Two times were for breakfast    a very good buffet    but very expensive  One time was for dinner which was just average with a very small menu  The pool was adequate for the children  The outside play area is old small and dirty    dont even let the kids know it is there if you can  The worst problem of all in this hotel is the partking  The parking is an additional  a day  The garage is under reation    although as far as we could tell this only means that  of the garage is blocked off  We drove our Ford Expedition which was very difficult to park  The ceilings were very low the spaces very small and the turning areas around some corners left about  inches in some areas  This is a dark dingy garage  We loved the city and the Jazz Festival  Next time we will try a nicer hotel  
P => A nice stay The Delta Montreal is centrally located in Downtown Montreal  Very easy walk to McGill Mont Royal and downtown shopping  Even old Montreal is within walking distance   be  hr or only a short cab ride The room appeared well used  Could use some updating and better electronics TV reception was fuzzy  At least the room was clean  Not overly impressed with the room but it was sure quiet at night  Ate in the pub and the food was excellent  Excellent and good value  Drinks were a bit overpriced They have a pool but is more of a lap pool than a quotfamilyquot pool  Weight room facilities are excellent The staff was quite helpful and friendly  No complaints at all  We paid around night for the quotconference ratequot  I would be tempted to try elsewhere for a better rate  If they gave me a discount on the rate I would consider staying there again  
P => Not As Nice As They Make It Seem  We booked through Hotwire as a last minute deal and paid   US for two nights  When doing so we were under the impression we were getting an amazing deal on a hotel which at regular price was   a night  We were wrong Perhaps I am too picky and be a bit anal but the pictures advertised and displayed on the internet are not an accurate reflection of the hotel and the rooms We arrived at the hotel at noon on our day of check in  The hotel is in a good location more in the business district but relatively close to everything  The lobby was nice and appealing  The front desk staff was extremely friendly and allowed us an early check in Our room located on the th floor was not a  star and by far not a  star as some places advertise it as  The entire floor smelled like cigarette smoke as did our room  Both were in poor condition  The carpets were filty and all the furnishing were VERY dated  Basic bathoom  The window were so dirty you could barely see out of them  And the balcony is hardly such as one chair could not fit there it is a concete enclosure and not at all appealing We brought our  month old with us and fed her on the bed accidently spilling her entire bowl on cereal on the sheets  The next day at bedtime we noticed that the sheets had not been changed  I requested some be brought up to us and moments later they arrived damp with stray hairs on them  The pool hottub and gym very satisfactory  Nice but nothing special I would not stay here again as the hotel does not compare to other Deltas I have had the pleasure of enjoying  The only positive thing I can say about this hotel and Montreal is the staff  VERY VERY friendly and most helpful To them many thanks To Delta clean up your hotelI would have refused to pay  a night to stay at this place  It is worth barely what we paid for it  
P => Excellent value We stayed three nights at the Delta Montreal and splurged for a signature room on the st floor  The room was excellent  We had access to the lounge on the rd floor and my husband and his colleagues used this space to have meetings  They had the entire place to themselves and access to a machine that made incredibly delicious coffee  A buffet breakfast was included and it was also excellent  We had fresh fruit yogurt cereal toast and baked goods that must have come straight out of the oven  From   pm hors douvres are served and they were really good one night and rather plain the other two nights The Delta is consistent at offering nice rooms and good service  It was really nice to be able meet over breakfast and not worry about finding a meeting spot during the day  We took advantage of the facilities while we were there and played squash   all free  The gym has every machine you can think of except for an eliptical The location of the hotel is excellent for shopping  Its a three minute walk to The Bay on St  Catherines Street I went to the spa and had a chocolate wrap   very nice but dont book it for the last hour of the day as I felt rushed by staff who wanted to go home For dinner we went to the Cube  Very expensive ultra modern restaurant and at first I worried that I wouldnt find anything I likes on the menu  I had the risotto which seemed a safe bet and it was to die for  In fact all our meals were  We also tried the Red Thai on St  Laurent and again it was excellent 
P => Middle of the Road The Delta Montreal is in a great location and offers all of the larger hotel amenities  The room was average with uninspired or  Maintenance problems were the downfall of my stay with banging pipes when the faucets were turned off and a heating unit that wouldnt work  Even after a visit from maintenance staff the heat shut off through the night leaving the room very cool  Housekeeping was superior and very efficient and the toiletries were above average  On past visits to Montreal I have stayed at the Omni great Le Meridien also great and the Nouvelle Hotel pretty good  If the Delta has a price that cant be beat than it is a good bet but otherwise Montreal has many finer properties in the same price range that are worth checking out  
P => Large rooms dismal or I stayed at the Delta Montreal in ober  It was one of the preferred hotels for a large medical conference I was attending  I got a good package deal on Expedia including airfare which was much less expensive than the quotconference rate quot The lobby is small but very nice with ble floors  The staff were very friendly and helpful  I was able to take a tour of Montreal right from the hotel which the concierge recommended which was definitely worth doing if youre not familiar with the city The rooms were very large and had two queen beds  The beds were comfortable with soft sheets  Oddly enough there was absolutely no artwork anywhere in the room which gave it an institutional feeling The patio as mentioned by other reviewers was a dismal slab of concrete overlying not much of a view priily of another building  However the setup of the building gives each room a private patio because the room is quotLquot shaped around the patio  There was one small dirty plastic chair but the weather was so cold I wouldnt have sat there anywayI had a nice lunch there since I only had a few minutes to get a bite to eat  Service was pleasant and efficient  They had nice toiletries in the bathroom and a large ble bathroom I would only stay there again if I got another great deal  Many of my workmates paid about  Canadian which was the quotconference ratequot  My deal came out to just over  a night and I wouldnt pay more than this  This is a  star at best  
P => The place to stay Stayed for a long weekend Couldnt have been better Great staffvery clean room and great location Everything you want when youre away from home Walking distance to shopping and sight seeing  
P => Good enough for me I stayed at Delta Montreal for three nights over Labor Day weekend and found it very clean the staff friendly and located in a great part of downtown  I was at first nervous with all the bad reviews but was put at ease when they were able to accommodate me at check me in very early  am My room was clean and there wasnt any bothersome quotnoise quotI would definitely stay here again 
P => run down Overall a ent hotel near Mont Royal  We found the room in need of a facelift however and our room had a cement patio with no furniture to sit on facing loud construction which began around  am  I would think that if you offered a patio it would be somewhat usable  We were told we were in a non smoking room and yet the smell when we st entered the room was of stale smoke  Perhaps it use to be a smoking room who knows We had one meal in the restaurant and it was OK  The gym appeared to be very large and probably one of the best features of this hotel We moved to Old Montreal after our stay at the Delta and much preferred that area for ambiance and things to do  BUT the room was on airmiles so no complaining about the value for our dollar 
P => Great hotel   I really enojoyed staying at the Delta in Montreal  The staff were pleasant not exactly friendly but they were very helpful in a business like way the food was nice and my room was really nice had a good view and was clean The only niggle was that I came back to my room at about pm one day to find someone disassembling my bed to put a new headboard on He looked at me and said that he could come back later but I told him to carry on and left the room I didnt go swimming so I cant comment about the state of the pool but the location of the hotel really is excellent  The TV was nice and big the facilities were good I got a box of chocolates from a local casino one day and a couple of other chocolates were left on my bed every day little touches but they all improve the experience  I really enjoyed my stay here and Im usually quite fussy about hotels 
P => Get the club room option   most for your  My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights and were impressed  Overall an excellent stay seamless check in and  out timely and friendly housekeeping accommodating bilingual staff  The rooms were typical of a chain hotel but our st floor corner room though shaped oddly would not be good for larger people due to the small space in between the desk that stuck out and the foot of the king size bed it was clean fresh and comfortable with a large bathroom no problems with hot water even for two arate showers in a row and small balcony with a great view  We found the bed pillows and comforter very soft and comfortable  The TV had basic cable that did tend to fuzz out very slightly and sputter a little in rainy weather  With the club room upgrade an extra  a night on Orbitz we got free continental breakfast two floors up in a lounge area as well as daily happy hour with delicious appetizers and an honor bar  The food was definitely above average for a hotel spread and the staff so friendly  My boyfriend loved the fitness room which seemed small at first but had enough to keep him occupied all three days and I hung out at the indoor pool too small to really have fun in but clean not very crowded and not too warm or cold and hot tub which was nice but not very new or high tech  The location was by far the best   walking distance to old montreal the southern plateau area all the shopping and bars and restaurants  We didnt need to take the metro anywhere  We will stay at the Delta Montreal again especially if we get a similar flight and hotel deal from a site like Orbitz  
P => Good value nice room Got the room on Hotwire for  US rated three  stars  Solid three star property  The room was large and very nice  Excellent access to Metro and near main downtown shopping area  The hotel is going through some needed upgrading but overall it is an excellent value in a good area  I would stay here again even if I had to pay a little more  I got a tip that if you see a   star property with a day care facility on Hotwire its the Delta Montreal not to be confused with Delta Centre Ville  
P => OK  Good for the money This hotel was under going reations that they failed to tell us in the lobby when we made our reservations  The rooms were a nice size  They all had ks which was nice  I stayed on the premier floor  rooms were clean and big   people hung out comfortably in one room The hotel spa ws gross  overcrowded and filled with french people  The hot tub wasnt hot and stunk like chlorine  The staff was ok  Pretty good area  Close cab ride to everything and a quick walk to the mall and adult entertainment facilities and bars  
P => Delta Montreal Lacking The hotel is the unrekable but utterly adequate spot that I anticipated based on reviews from here and there  That said the staff was very friendly and the location was terrific but plenty of other hotels are in the immediate vicinity  One selling point for me was the indoor poolhot tub   both of which turned out to be a disappointment  The pool was barely lukewarm and the hot tub needed a warm up and was a suspicious deep green color But the city itself made up for any disappointments with accommodations  What a fabulous weekend we had   as we unfailingly do in this wonderful city 
P => Great Hotel Just stayed at the Delta Montreal for Valetines weekend  Great hotel service was impeccable  I was looking for a particular cuisine and they went out of their way to help  The only problems takes awhile for the hot water to kick it but when it does its nice and hot so just give the shower a little run before you get in if you book on expedia you  not get the room that is shown in the picture  We expected a smoking room with a king size bed but when we got there we ended up with a non smoking room and what they say is a king size bed but in reality it was a double   but the room was still very nice a lot smaller than we were promised but nice   BIG bathroom  Overall great place great pool not a lot of kids running around   check out the work out room they have a good selection of machines    i will definately stay there again    
P => Great stay at the Delta I loved staying at the Delta Montreal for many reasons not the least of which was that the room was so nice and so clean and we had a beautiful terrace with great views of the city  The staff was very friendly and spoke both English and French  The location was perfect  We were within walking distance of the great shopping on St  Catherines Old Montreal and the Underground shopping mall  The hotel has a pool which wasnt used by me but was very nice and clean  It also has a room off of the lobby where you can check e mail for free great perk as I dont have a laptop  All in all for my money the Delta was PERFECT I cant wait to go there again  
P => A very pleasant expierience  For anyone looking for a fantastic location wonderful and helpful hospitality and great food the Delta Montreal would be one hotel to keep in mind  The entire staff could not have been more pleasant if they tried  I was late in arriving due to travelling disasters with the airline I flew with it took me three days to get there instead of one but the hotel staff graciously assisted my dhter who needs a wheelchair at the moment because of an injury and I couldnt have asked for better service or consideration The Concierge Alex went above and beyond the call of duty when he gave us information and assistance a very good natured person  The other gentlemen whose names I didnt learn were just as helpful All of the people at the front desk were exceptionally polite and helpful  The food service from the waiters and waitresses was excellent and the food was delicious Our room was a premiere room very clean quiet attractive and relaxing Montreal is a fabulous city to visit  This hotel makes your stay feel like you are at home  Everyone has a smile  Having been a flight attendant in the past I have stayed in many but the Delta Montreal obviously looks for staff with excellent attitudes and do their very best to provide quotover the topquot graciousness It is close to the Metro shopping great restaurants  It rocks I will definitely make it my new home away from home whenever I visit again  
P => Great deal at the Delta Montreal Just returned from a week in Montreal at the Delta Montreal  We found the staff to be very friendly and always willing to help the rooms were clean and the daily housekeeping meticulous  The large windows and balconies are a plus  We had four people   two rooms  and the rooms were quite different from each other  with unusual shapes  Comfortable chairs and good bed  Especially nice were the pool and weight room and the two computers provided for Internet access no costs by guests  The location cannot be beat  It was very very cold and we were only a very short walk from the underground The hotel provides everything needed for a quite comfortable stay  We give it five stars because of the great value good price for us wonderful staff and housekeeping and terrific location  
P => Wonderfully average I stayed two nights at the Delta Montreal after getting a room for  a night on Hotwire  This is one of the rare times where a quotstar ratingquot was exactly right  The Hotwire quotstar ratingquot gave it   out of  at I agree completely  The good news is that the rooms are clean the bed comfortable the service on par and the location excellent  There was nothing extraordinary about the Delta but there were no bad points as well  If I were to knitpick the hotel seems to be in the beginning stages of wearing down such as some minor peeling wallpaper in the hallways some wear and tear in the rooms but not shabby at all  I would give it a  star review if the place was spruced up a little more  However on the whole if you can get this hotel for under  bucks a night you are getting a great deal  
P => fine place to stay in an extra fine city The Delta Montreal is the equivalent of your typical downtown riott hotel   nice if unexciting rooms efficient service plenty of amenities geared toward the business traveler and a good location The hotel is in a nice location downtown next to McGill University  THe area around the hotel is dominated by office buildings so it tends to be quieter on the weekends but its a block from the upscale shopping of Sherbrooke St  and two blocks from the carnival midway atmosphere of St  Catherine Street  The Place des Arts metro station is a block away and the McGill metro station is about a block and a half away The calm lobby is understated and elegant  The rooms dont have a whole lot of character   theyve got that typical business class hotel taupe look   but they are quite large  They also have balconies and from one of the higher floors you can get great views of Mont Royal or downtown  The bathrooms are also quite large and well stocked with fluffy towels and bath amenities  The hotel has an exceptional fitness center Downtown Montreal is loaded with enough good restaurants shops movie theaters museums and assorted attractions to keep you busy for a year  Most of the downtown action is an easy walk from the hotel and if its the middle of one of Montreals brutal winters you can cross the street and enter the Underground City which links many of the downtown shopping centers hotels office buildings train station hockey arena etc Old Montreal the observation tower at Olympic Stadium the trendy Plateau neighborhood and other sights are a short ride away on Montreals fine rubber tired metro  
P => loved the hotel I was in Montreal for a wedding and i had the greatest time at your hotel I had the best service and your staff was so friendly and helpfull thanks so much 
P => Great Hotel Will definately This hotel met and exceeded every expecatation  The check in takes about a minute the rooms full of amenities and luxury  The bathroom clean the public rooms even cleaner  You could easily eat off the floor here The prices are very reasonable and the location is excellent  Parking is very safe and well lit underground Even though all that stuff is superb the best aspect of the hotel is the staff  They will go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay enjoyable  No request is to difficult for these great workers They could raise their rates and I would still return  
P => Excellent Customer Service Clean GREAT rates We stayed at the Delta in Montreal during Christmas of  and loved it  Great rates exceptionally friendly and helpful staff  First room was ugly and they moved us to nicer floor with better room for the same rate  The location is nice  The hotel has a clean pool area  Parking beneath the hotel for low rate and safe  Close to downtown underground mall and shops within  blocks  McGill right around the corner  Well definately stay here again  
P => nice lobby This Delta is the exception to us  In western Canada they are very nice business hotels with busy ammenities in the room highspeed eg In Delta Montreal the public areas were very nice the staff were very helpful and went out of their way  Even cleaning up dog dodo   left in the elevator by some inconsiderate dog owner   dont let animals stay the animal is good the people arent always The room we had was very outdated and not welcoming and the fan noise was very loud  We took two rooms as we have older children but our request as reserving for adjoining rooms wasnt met  This would be our least favorite Delta and we have stayed in about  different Delta properities  
P => Love this place stayed here      This was my nd time in Montreal but my st time at the Delta Montreal  All I can say is that this hotel was great it was convienent to Ste Catherine St and area attractions  I booked this hotel through there web site and got a room on the Signature Club Floor VIP for   USD per night  These are the best rooms in the hotel with a balcony overlooking the city  beautiful   It just so happened that I was there during the Canadian holiday and they had a firework display that was to die for and being on the st floor it was like having front row seats  Also if you in the Signature room you get free continental breakfast  As for the people who complained about the balcony other then it not having chairs there was nothing wrong with it  
P => Very pleasant stay We had a very pleasant stay in    Although Id paid only  on Priceline my request for a non smoking room high up was quickly granted at checkin  The hotel was very clean  The room was quite large with a balcony and very quiet  The indoor pool and jacuzzi quite nice  Helpful concierge  Convenient parking  Lovely lobby and public spaces  
P => Very Nice I liked the Delta Montreal the staff was friendly and helpful  I had a great room with everything I needed  I was not however intrigued with the balcony which was concrete and had no sitting area  They need to put some chairs or something on the balcony or whats the point of having a balcony  Overall I liked the sports club and restaurant in the hotel and used both  
P => I will be there again We stayed at the Delta Montreal for Easter il  il    It was FANTASTIC  I absolutely love this hotel and I will definitely stay there again  We arrived at pm and our room was ready  We stayed on the rd floor which meant we were a part of the Signature Club  Our room was immaculate  My only problem with this hotel was the smell of the room  We requested a non smoking room but it smelled like  smokers were hiding under the bed with  cigarettes each hanging from their mouths  It was terrible  Right away we opened the balcony doors in an effort to air it out  We ended up buying an aroma candle at the drugstore to freshen it up  I would have complained but I was too busy admiring the beautiful duvet hypo allergenic I might add as requested by my fianc  as well as the chocolates on our bed and the card indicating the weather for the day  The bathroom was clean and a large enough counter top for us to spread our toiletries There was also a spacious desk in the bedroom area internet access a beautiful Sony Dream machine CD radio alarm clock  It was great The bed Awesome  I told my boyfriend this is probably the best bed I have ever slept in outside of my own  It was soft yet firm large yet cozy  and the sheets were FRESH  I could go on and on about this bed forever  I adored it We walked around the hotel a bit it has a gym a pool and a business centre which seem to be open to all guests  I do want to say something about the pool please watch your children because I don t think they have a lifeguard  My boyfriend and I stood outside the window and watched a small child struggle to keep her head above water while her parents sat in the hot tub about  feet away  Luckily another parent in the pool grabbed her but it was scary considering we were outside helpless If you are a part of the Signature Club your breakfast will be provided in an upper dining room  The usual standard of toast and fruit but the variety is worth it  We were never there for Happy Hour but I will definitely participate in it the next time I visit  The location is convenient to St Catharine street and the Metro the subway system The staff are very friendly and helpful This is a fantastic hotel  The out fa ade resembles a mid grade otel but inside is amazing  I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal  
P => LOVING IT DETAL HOTEL wassssss great it was the best I love how its such a big hotel   and i was there for model UN and wow it was unbelieveable i cant believe that ohters didnt like it   boooooooo anyways i loved it   ttyl bye 
P => Great hotel all problems in previous reviews are fixed  We stayed at the Delta Montreal  th  It was great  We got an amazing deal on priceline not sure if I can say the price but US per night  The basic rooms were SPACIOUS very clean and modernly orated  There was always sufficient free coffee and tea packages left by the room attendants  The facilities pool restaurant gift shop lobby were very clean orated for the holiday season immaculately  The staff was pleasant and helpful  We expected them to be snobby as the first impression in the main lobby is quite elegant but they were very nice and helpful  Best of all they spoke English There are  downfalls  Parking is  Canadian per night free parking is available on the street but we didnt want to risk having the car stolen or hit over night  The pool closes at pm on weekends  It was full of people eager to stay and swim but the attendant demanded that everyone get out at  because it closed at   SHe then knocked on changerooms and rushed everyone because she had to leave at   The pool is all one depth so not too good for kids bring arm floats or a ring for the kids  The hot tub was a fair size and could seat about  comfortably  Overall its a great hotel  All the bad reviews that we read prior to visiting have been fixed  The elevator service is very quick and frequent  The location is also convenient to everything shopping restaurants Old Montreal etc  
P => Very good Hotel reasonable price  My wife and I just returned from a  day stay in Montreal at the Hotel Delta Montreal  We found it to be quite good  The employees were always friendly and helpful  The room was always kept clean by houskeeping services and the hotel bar was very nice  The hotel itself is in a very centralized location and many sights are in walking distance  The Metro subway station is also close by and very easy to use  The accomodations are very reasonable and for the price you get a good value  Anyone thinking of staying at this hotel should request to be in the quotSignature Clubquot which gives you access to a daily complimentary continental type breakfast and a quotHappy Hourquot from  p m  to  p m  I would definitely recommend the Hotel Delta Montreal to business or leisure travellers

P => Ci   piaciuto molto  
P => My favorite hotel ever This is my familys favorite hotel of all time  Its a beautiful hotel in downtown Montreal in the heart of in my opinion the best city in Canada  This hotel is connected to the train station across the way through an underground tunnel  Its also connected to the underground city and Metro the same way  If the weather is bad in Montreal which it can be in the winter you can walk underground to Catherine St or catch the metro without stepping outside The rooms in this hotel are amazing  what can I say It doesnt get better than a ble lobby and bathrooms  We are always given a corner room and they are spacious and everything is very high end from the bedding to the robes to the linens There is a wonderful pool and gym in the lower level  The pool is smallish but beautiful and the gym is top notch and Ive never seen it too busy  My very only complaint at this hotel was that my older dhter  was treated poorly when she took her younger brother to the pool and my husband and I went to the gym on two different occasions and by two different staff  Shes a younger looking  yr old and they were rude  I was surprised at the customer service training and if it happens again I will mention it to staff  Aside from that its a great hotel in the heart of downtown  Ive stayed many times with and without kids and family and have never been disappointed  
P => Fit for a Queen or princess Excellent location right above train station  VERY convenient if taking AMTRAK back to New York City  Hotel workers were on strike so there was no bellman to help with luggage and towels were located in the hallway by the elevator  Minor inconvenience  Excellent room with large beds plenty of pillows and great big bathroom  Carpet was so quotgushyquot that I really enjoyed going barefoot  Tons of room to walk around  Considering there was limited maid service the room was spotless  I have visions of a front desk guy in a suit cleaning the toilet and making the bed  Sick funny humor  Great location above train station makes for easy access to food court in main terminal or walking through the underground passageway into the shopping malls food court   handy for spending those last few quotlooniesquot and getting more souveniers  GREAT hotel GREAT location exceptional room and amenities  
P => Total hospitality failure  Zero stars A Holiday Inn masquerading as a  star hotel  Location above the central train station is the one and only redeeming factor of this hotel Obnoxious and intrusive staff was rude and unprofessional  I would never again stay here and could never recommend it to others  A real disappointment in an otherwise enchanting city and country  
P => Still a nice stay   regardless of the strike Stayed at the Fairmonth Queen Elizabeth for  nights in tember   I felt bad crossing the picket lines to gain access to the lobby but after flying through the night to Montreal I just needed a room  The front desk staff were up front about the strike and gave us an opportunity to book somewhere else  We chose to stay and they gave us early check in  They were friendly and courteous just as you come to expect from a Fairmonth property  Our room upon check in was clean and the beds were SUPER comfy The best thing of this property is LOCATION We walked everywhere   the shopping Old Montreal St  Catherines Crescent Street Bell Centre    it was great There were a couple of times I really wished they had room service but due to the strike all the restaurants and house keeping were shut down We didnt let the strike hinder our great time in Montreal   I still think the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is a great hotel 
P => Still The Best Have stayed at many places in Montreal over the years and the Queen Elizabeth still rates at the top for value convenience size of rooms cleanliness and a young top quality helpful staff  The rooms are spacious without the signs of wear and tear in other prime locations  The various Concierge attendants were right on in their analysis of local restaurants and were gracious helpful and patient almost to a fault  The hotel warned me in advance about an ongoing strike but other than picking up our own clean towels and making our own beds a five minute chore the staff on duty were incredibly helpful accommodating and polite and surprisingly quick to respond  The rooms were in perfect order when we arrived and check in took no more than about three minutes  When I recently had a problem with internet service in a Boston hotel at  a night it took hours for a staff member to appear and correct the problem and internet service still cost an extra  a day there  But at half those room prices Internet service at Fairmonts gorgeous hotels is free if you sign up for their Presidents Club at no charge and when I had a problem with a broken cable they despite the strike appeared in less than five minutes with a new cable  Other hotels  have more attitude but nothing beats the Queen in Montreal  Thank you again Fairmont 
P => Good under siege We were at the hotel th to th ust  Our room was delightful and regularly serviced through the strike  One has to sympathise with low paid staff working in hotels and the strikers seemed pleasant enough and their cheerful latin music on the pavement outside quite fun  The restaurants had to shut but breakfast was still served really quite excellent the work of  sous chefs who has still turned in  The management were splendid in doing their best to keep the hotel running for the the guests already booked in  Our breakfast waiters were impeccably suited management and seemed to rather enjoy being at the sharp end again and proving they could still do it  Many of the management were obviously working double shifts to keep the show on the road  The hotel returned to me the computer power lead I had left in the Royal York in Toronto and part of my bill was deducted with apologies for the lack of service Still very good   
P => Beware At least during this work to rule We are just finishing a stay here booked with no knowledge of the union trouble  Days go by without any room cleaning they dont even bother telling you they can do it they know it will not happen  People scavenging towels from cleaning carts that sit in the hallways unmoved for hours  Even the mini bars remain unattended I watched someone pop out of a room grab a few beer from the cart unattended for hours and pop back into his room  No doubt he ran out in roomRoyal Service line through which you are forced to call to get anywhere   even to the concierge or front desk   takes   minutes only top route through to another line where you wait again  The Concierge here are the worst I have come across in many good hotels  They know nothing useful are singularly unhelpful and provide in our experience information that is just plain wrong It was a bit amusing at first to see the union members in shorts and t shirts with the cap or name tag but it lost its comedic impact after a while  The union employees seem intent on making your stay miserable  It is working The hotel is just plain dirty right now  The people snarly  The feel is a bit primal    every guest for themselves I have stayed here many times and this is bizarre  Until they solve their issues with the employees stay far away  
P => Never again  Nice suite in the corner on a high floor but other than that Disgraceful  The Beavers Club is classic but the casual restaurant is so overdone and the food is bad  It is so big it has no feel to it  Location is pretty good for buisness but would not go back  
P => Nice A little late on my review but better late then never  Good place to stay  Clean pleasant staff even helped me with a little French of course make sure you ask when it isnt busy  Good location although my agenda made me drive everywhere but thats not due to bad location  Night club in a high rise across the street brought interesting people into the area also because it was a long weekend people were out playing  Parking was available at  a day  I tried my luck and parked on the street but the morning of the last day labor day monday holiday I got a  parking ticket  OMG  I guess parking restrictions apply on this holiday  there were arate signs for this restriction at   am aside from the other sign for restrictions for the rest of the day and dont forget the signage for the parking spot   and where to pay   signs for one set of parking spaces   the ticket was  minutes after  am so they must have been just waiting for us tourists to mess up I wasnt the only one    even in NYC isnt as steep  Not the hotels fault but shame on you Montreal 
P => More than satisfied I was extremely satisfied with my stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth in Montreal  I booked with WhataHotel and my room was much nicer than the room I had booked myself just six months earlier  The staff is courteous and the location is excellent  
P => Beautiful rooms We stayed here one night and really loved the or of the room perhaps on the smaller side but didnt really anything larger  Unfortunately because of a strike there was rubbish on the floor in the corridors as well as bed linens left by the housekeeping staff Besides that the location was great very centrally located downtown and very quiet and comfotable  Staff were pleasant and helpful   Id definitely stay again 
P => Fairmont Gold is Golden My wife and I spent two nights at the Queen Elizabeth in a Gold room  This is our third time at this hotel but the first time on the Gold floors  It was magnificent Note that this was during the labour disputesnegotiations underway so we had expected subpar service and things not being done etc  But to the contrary service was excellent We drove up and was greeted promptly by a doorman who stole a quick look at my luggage and called me by name  Pretty cool  Then we took the private elevator for Gold floor only to the Gold floor reception  Very quick and personal service  The person knew right away this was our third stay  Nice to be thanked for quotcoming back quotRoom was not as large as I thought itd be website says room is  sq ft     that cant be  But its not small by any means  Bathroom was smallish but okay  Room was very nicely and tastefully furnished in subdued gold and dark brown tones  Electronic safe had quottechnical difficultiesquot during our stay  Coffeemaker in room  Large workdesk sitting area  Very spacious for two  Our room looks out the west and right on top of the cathedral next door  Nice view of Blvd Rene Levesque at night Breakfast is included and their idea of continental includes crepes scrambled eggs all sorts of fruit cold cuts smoked salmon pastries oatmeal etc  Very nice spread From   each evening theres a large spread of goodies such as sushi smoked salmon pastries and many other delicacies  You can literally have dinner there BTW all day till  pm you can get drinks water soda coffee tea etc in the lounge Service attitude was excellent All in all a most enjoyable stay  
P => Great Location My husband and I  ex Montrealers came back to visit the city y    We had booked a regular room but were offered an upgrade to the Gold level for  a day  We stayed on the th floor and our room was newly reated  Gold service included a private lounge with a fabulous view that serves breakfast evening snacks cold drinks are available through the daynight  Internet service is free maid service twice daily and newspaper of our choice  There is also a concierge desk with very helpful staff   you dont need to go to the main lobby to check out The room itself was nice amp had a great view   however there were not enough drawersstorage space  We were okay with it but if you want to watch TV most of the channels are in French  One amusing thing   the lobby  Both my husband and I had our high school graduations here were in our s and the lobby or is still the same Possibly the same as when John and Oko stayed here too Didnt affect us as we did not hang out there Location   we picked this hotel for its great location   you can walk to Old Montreal all along the underground Place Ville ie Eaton Centre Place Montreal Trust etc  and St  Catherine Street  Plus the train station Central Station is right downstairs nothing to walk to the Metro or catch a bus and there are tons of cabs available  We plan on staying at the Queen E again next year  
P => Great Hotel We recently returned from a weeks stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth where we enjoyed a beautiful ior suite for  per night  The suite included a bedroom sitting room two baths robes and a great view  We had initially booked an quotapartmentquot elsewhere in the city   but upon arrival found that it was not accurately represented by the photos posted on the website  As this was not acceptable to us we called the Fairmont and received great service from the reservationist  When we arrived at the hotel our suite was not ready which was fine since we had just called  mintues earlier  Pascal the front desk clerk who took great care of us gave us two free drink coupons for the bar while we waited  The staff were very friendly and accommodating The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to Vieux Montreal and directly above the central train station  The station which has great bakeries and coffee shops is connected to the vast underground shopping mall The hotel has a great fitness center with several treadmills elipticals and strength training equipment  There is also a pool which was a bit cold for me a sauna jacuzzi and whirlpool  The hotel offers tea service in the afternoons in the lobby which was quite fun  We ordered room service twice  They were prompt the food was the correct temperature delicious and beautifully presented  We enjoyed our stay there very much  
P => Beautiful Hotel and Clean Room and Great Location We stayed here during the Montreal Jazz Festival  The GoodOverall the room and bathroom was clean  Nice appointments such as the furniture and robes in bathroom  The downtown location gave easy accessibility to the Jazz Festival  min walk and train station next door  The hotel lobby was nicely laid out with restaurant and tourist shops The Not so Good Room was a little smaller than used to for a hotel of this rating and class  Did read prior reviews from Tripadvisor guests who stated the same thing before booking  The hotel workers joined the strike of hotel workers in many hotels in Montreal and as you can imagine service was not present for changing rooms and handling bags  Fortunately for us we were checking out the day the strike happened  However I did see management step up and try to bring luggage to rooms and carts were left out in the hallway for fresh towels soaps etc  
P => Will not be back there Not at all what I expected for a  star hotel I have traveled all over the world for business and this stay cost a lot more for a lot less than I have had at any other  star hotel  Firmly believe you get what you pay for and dont mind paying for it except for this time Rooms were small reations not complete at least I hope not as the bathroom really needs it carpet in the hall ways were hazardous with bulges  Definitely not the cleanest I was at the Fairmont Queen E for a conference stayed eight nights  After the fourth day I realized that the red bumps which scabbed up quickly only around my neck and head and in my ears   each morning were bed bug bites  The hotel staff tried to convince me that it was due to allergies of the laundry cleaning chemicals in which they changed the bedding with new cleaned in vinegarwater and advised me to talk to a dor when I get home  I did and was confirmed bed bug bites  I was refused any kind of compensation for this The best part of the stay was the location  Handy to everything else you could possible need sites shopping culture night life amp food and most of the staff were pleasant   The tours were informative  The spa was fabulous and would highly recommend that spa only I would stay elsewhere  
P => It was nice worth checking out Fairmont QE was centrally located in the heart of Montreal  My husband and I stayed here for three days for conference  Although the rooms were small it was very comfortable  I liked the fact that we could walk everywhere and it was also very close to museums and shopping  The only downside is that everything at the hotel was very expensive     for drinks   for a bottle of Evian and   for a snickers bar  Otherwise I would recommend this hotel   
P => Gold floor  gold service The Queen Elizabeth is a charming hotel in a fantastic location  close to businesses restaurants and shopping  The gold floor is modern and comfortable  The lounge offers appetizers and breakfast daily  It also has views of the city and internet access  The service is excellent and we would highly recommend the gold floors at the QE Montreal to anyone  
P => Over rated Hotel  Save money and stay elsewhere  Not  star quality  This hotel claims to be a  star hotel but really is just an ordinary hotel inside  The rooms are plain and are small  Parking is by valet only and is run by an outside company that hires rude and unclean people  The valets are rough on the vehicles and dont be surprised to get a scratch on your vehicle  What you should know     a night for internet service  a day for poor valet parking service  per local callrude valet and hotel staff andhousekeeping cleans the room early in the morning be prepared to put a do not distribute sign up before you go to bed  I would rather stay at the Holiday Inn Express and save  a night 
P => Weekend at the Queen Elizabeth We had high hopes of this hotel  having just stayed in the Fairmont in Mont Tremblant  It is a very nice hotel and there are many positives about it but it is not perfect  The rooms are fairly small and the bathrooms tiny but very nicely done and probably as expected for a city hotel  The driver who brought us from Mont Tremblant told us that this was the best hotel in the city for service but we found one or two aspects a little disappointing  First of all there was a lovely selection of Fairmont teas in the room but no kettle  We had to ask twice before a kettle was produced and it seemed to take forever  When the staff member brought it we had realised that our heating was not working but she tried to fob us off and we had to be very firm until she agreed to look into it The room was cold and it was snowing heavily outside  It appeared that the computer control had been switched off so there was no problem once that was sorted out  Despite the fact that there were three of us in the room we only got  cups and had to ask for a third then the maid took it away on our second day so we had to ask again A minor issue but irritating  Surely they know who is staying in a roomThe public areas in the hotel are beautiful and the staff on reception very helpful  On Sunday when the business centre was closed the receptionist checked us in for our flight and printed our boarding passes saving us lots of time The food in the bar was excellent and the staff really helpful and friendly The hotel is really well situated and sits on top of the railway station and an excellent shopping mall with a really good food court  We got an excellent breakfast in the station for  for three people The old port is about  minutes walk from the hotel and the main shopping street  minutes away The main downside was that it is a very large hotel and tended to be noisy  There was always a door slamming somewhere along the corridor and the lifts were always crowded Overall a really enjoyable stay in Montreal  
P => Very good experience at Queen Liz I was here for two nights before returning home to Calgary  I got a suite upgrade and the stay was fabulous  The hotel is walking distance to good shopping and food  It was also close to the Latin Quarters and Chinatown  The suite had  full bathroom inside the bedroom and  bathroom in the living room area  Miller Harris toiletries as per usual Fairmont Standards  The gym facility was spacious and clean  I noticed that the hotel staff found it unusual for me to request afternoon tea sent to my hotel suite as it is quite custoy in the other Fairmonts in western Canada Hotel staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly   
P => Good location but pricey I stayed here on business for  nights in ember   The hotel is in an excellent location connected to an extensive underground mall and close to transportation train subway lots of taxis  The main shopping streets are also very close by  So are a number of good restaurants  The dining in the hotel is ridiculously expensive so Id skip eating there and just go outside  I had one of the recently reated rooms so was quite satisfied with the accommodation  But for the price it certainly wasnt exceptional Overall   Overpriced food and accommodation but well located and clean and quiet  
P => Well   Well    Well   My kids love staying at a Fairmont H tel     Ch teau Frontenac     We ided to try the one in Montr al   QE    I guest the employes dont have the same contract because   It certainely didnt feel the same    The room was nice  except the bathroom floor did need some dusting    Certainely the Ch teau Frontenac has a better Valet and Concierge service by far    
P => Loved the QE We were arriving by train and the location is just phenomenal It was in winter and its easy access to the underground meant that we could walk everywhere in comfort  Our room was mid sized spacius enough for two and quite nicely orated  Great view too The hotel lobby was quite spectacular  We would definitely recommend this if youre visiting Montreal  
P => Very convenient stay We stayed here recently for six nights since my husband had a conference on the premises  He said the conference facilities were good  The check in was friendly and efficient They gave us a room with the criteria we requested however we didnt realize how small it was  If one doesnt mind a cozy room it would be fine  But for my husband who has claustrophobia it was not suitable for the length of time wed be staying  I must admit that it was even smaller than any rooms Ive stayed in when traveling in Europe So we requested a switch to a larger room  Fortunately one was available and they gladly switched us  We were very happy with our spacious and comfortable larger room on the top floor with a nice view  The restroom was on the small side but it was adequate enough  As a member of the Fairmont club we also were not charged for the Internet connection and had free local phone calls and a newspaper delivered  We consulted the concierge for restaurant suggestionsbookings during our stay and they were all very professional and helpful  We ate at the Montrealis one of their hotel restaurants a couple times during our stay and were very satisfied  Great salad and dessert bar  They also have a five star restaurant in the hotel that we consideredhowever we did not try  On the lower level there is a health club with up to date exercise equipment spa and indoor pool  I did use this a couple times and was glad it was there  There is a gift shop off the lobby where you can also get beverages and yummy pastries  One big advantage of this hotel is its location  There is an underground city right below the hotel with food courts boutiques etc  so it is convenient to not have to go outside in the winter  I liked the option of grabbing a reasonable breakfast there instead of eating in the more expensive hotel restaurant every day  The hotel is also above the train station  If you stayed here during the summer where it is more pleasant to walk outside you could walk to Old Montreal or other sites downtown  Finally the check out was quick and efficient  I wouldnt hesitate to stay there again as long as I could be assured wed get the same sized room  
P => No Bang All Buck This hotel has one saving grace the location  When we first arrived at the hotel with our group the hotel had butchered our reservations  We had a total of three rooms two of which were to be occupied the day myself and my two friends arrived  The hotel had listed my reservation as starting the previous day and had listed me as a no show  My friends reservation was correct but our reservation for a third room beginning the day after was not listed  After  minutes of trying to explain the situation and showing the confirmations for the rooms we had one of the two rooms  My two friends had to wait for their room   The actual room was tiny  The bed was worn and not luxurious at all  Internet use costs  dollars a day on top of the  dollar room charge  I was also charged   to make a call to a restaurant  blocks away  The mattress was hard and the linens were what one would expect in an Army barracks  The bathroom is another story  It was small and cramped  The toilet was about one inch from the vanity making any use of it unpractical  I requested another room and it had the same problem  The tub was cracked and chipping around a drain that did not function properly  The bathroom also does not have ventilation   The Beaver Club is a nice restaurant but apparently they serve their shrimp rare in the shrimp cocktail  Gooey shrimp is not my idea of fine dining  The bar attached to the restaurant is actually very good  Daniel the bartender is quite the expert on Quebec beer and that made the nights enjoyable   All in all find another place to stay in Montreal  
P => Amazing Hotel  I recently stayed here for a romantic  day getaway with my wife  The stay was amazing the hotel is beautiful and the service is top notch we booked online using restomontreal ca and the deal was impressive FYI     
P => Not worthy of the Fairmont name Ive stayed at a few Fairmonts around the world and have come to find them to be very nice in general and as a result expected a certain degree of service and amenities at this hotel  I was very disappointed  The first problem was that there were at least  people in line to check in when we arrived  I realize that this Fairmont is very large but a line of that length at a Fairmont just isnt acceptable  The next and main problem was the rooms were drab tiny and just depressing  Ive stayed in small hotel rooms before but the hotels managed to make up for this with luxurious linens and really nice rooms    this concept has not cht on at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth  The beds were extremely uncomfortable and had the thinnest sheets Ive ever encountered  The other furniture was very dated as well and the sink in the bathroom was badly scratched up  The room also had a strange and unidentifiable smell  Also while housekeeping was good at cleaning the rooms I found an extra keycard to our room not ours as my husband and I both had ours in the hallway  Im assuming it had been left behind by the previous guests  The most disturbing part was that the keycard still worked and had been in the hallway outside our door all night  The only good part was the bar downstairs that offered a wide range of tasty cocktails to enjoy while listening to the piano player  I will never stay at this hotel again and recommend you avoid it if possible  
P => Not what I expected I stayed at this hotel hoping for a typical Fairmont stay  That is usually very good  This time unfortunately I was disappointed  The common areas of the hotel were beautiful but the room I was put in was very dated and in need of reation  I was staying there because it was one of the convention hotels  The carpet was old and not particularly clean the room small and the noise next door came through loud and clear  On the other hand the restaurant the Montrealais was wonderful and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a great restaurant experience in Montreal  All three of us had rack of lamb and were not disappointed  For only a dollar more we had the salad bardessert bar and coffee  
P => Get an UPDATED room While there are some definite pluses to this hotel they can be outweighed by a depressing room that is in need of reation  We paid including taxes  per night and this got us a room on the th floor  I had requested a high floor with a view of the cathedral and we got that  But the th floor is one of the floors that has not been redone and we should have asked to be moved The sink was all cracked the carpet through this floor looked worn and it was not the greatest way to start a vacation    even the  our room number was crooked on the door We noticed that when the elevator would stop on different floors that some looked quite nice all the good reviews you read are probably from those floorsThe reason we stayed there was because we were going to take the train to Quebec and that was a wonderful feature  We simply took the elevator to that level  You an also access the subway under the hotel along with lots of food courts and shopping  We enjoyed all of that and also the good location for shopping downtown and not too great of a walk but not too close either to the old section of Montreal We ate dinner in the old section at Cafe Bonaparte and would recommend that highly  We chatted with a couple who were staying at the hotel Auberge Bonaparte who were very happy with their choice  If we were to go back that is the property that Iwould chose  If you go to the Queen Elizabeth just be sure you get an updated room and I think you will enjoy your stay 
P => Lennon Suite a Blast I stayed in the John Lennon Suite and took the entire package including pyjamas music menus limo and rose petals  This is an example of a room that costs a few dollars but where the experience matched the price The room is exciting and the service I received from this stay was exceptional  It was a real moment to be able to spend a night in a room where Lennon recorded Give Peace a ChanceOverall very pleased  
P => This is a  start hotel Was shocked to see that so many rooms in this hotel have still not been renated after nearly  years the last time I stayed here   and they were renating then  The lobby is quite eiving as it is of  or even  star caliber  The rooms however are quite dated and desparately need to be addressed  They are working on this but how long can a hotel take On the positive side the staff is very friendly  
P => Great Location The Queen Liz is a very comfortable stay if you get it at a resonable rate  I booked it through expedia and was given a nice discount  Its very close to it all St  Catherines St   Peel Street and sits atop the Montreal train station where there is also a mall with shops and lots of breakfast  coffee options  The service at the hotel is top notch and very friendly Valet parking was very quick and can be found in back of the hotel at a resonable rate of  canadian a day  I would stay here again 
P => great position but overall disappointing The fairmont is definetely in a great position right in the heart of downtown Montreal  It has underground access to shopping centers the subway and train station  But overall I dont think this hotel is really upto its costs  The rooms are large but not particularly clean the carpet was patched with stains and furniture covered in dust and the bathroom was pretty worn out with broken ble tiles and an old shower  Service is high quality but then again I really cant justify a  star hotel asking for an extra  dollar payment for check out luggage storage which should be included in a  star service  
P => Great location very nice hotel We booked within  weeks of our trip and couldnt get one of the romantic hotels but this was just fine  Very clean helpful but small rooms and bath  Centrally located    minute walk to the old city  minutes to shopping on Rue St Catherine and  minutes to the museums on Sherbrook  There was someone in the gym to explain the equipment and great help at the concierge  Just beware that breakfast can be very expensive  We took one look at the price and went down to the the train station food court for a good hot breakfast for  for about   Also theres coffee shops on almost every corner and many cafes  Enjoy this clean friendly hotel in a clean friendly city  
P => The Queen Elizabeth was great A very good hotel the rooms were excellent   The large windows in the rooms provide an excellent view and very good lightingWe had two rooms overlooking the city and in the afternoon it started to snow the view was awesomeThe restaurant in the hotel is a bit expensive for the quality of food they provide Breakfast which was included with our room was very good although the selection was a bit dissappointing compared to the other Fairmont Hotels we had stayed inOverall I would recommend this hotel but have dinner some other placeRooms very clean service excellent and staff very friendly 
P => Wonderful Hotel stay on Gold floor We were staying at the Omni which was horrible  so we previewed a king room on the Gold floor  and ided to move  our rate was  per night well worth it  Wonderful service  large daily breakfast and evening snacks  and our view and room were perfect  I think our room was almost double the size of their standard room  we had our own foyer  bar nice large ble bath  desk with two chairs  two club chairs with ottomans and a very comfortable king bed  I had worked in a luxury hotel for over  years  so I am picky regarding cleanliness and staff attentiveness and both were wonderful  The restaurants are also very good  the pool was nice and the jacuzzi and steam room were good as well  They have a nice gym  The weights seemed to be a liitle on the worn side  but the place was clean  I did not want to leave this Hotel  I had such a great stay 
P => Better Times at the Queen Elizabeth My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal  We stayed on the st floor top floor and had a descent size room with a king bed  The city view was very nice and the service was excellent  Overall we had a better stay and experience at the Queen Liz than the Square Phillipe although the Square Phillipe was also a blast  Make sure to check out our pictures of the square phillipe  Love The Mud Masked Couple 
P => The Fairmont is a Great Choice From start to finish a wonderful experience  Although the exterior of the hotel could use some updating the interior is well maintained  The front desk staff was helpful and very friendly  Elevators were quick and efficient  The room was a bit on the small side but with two double beds a huge armoire and a table with one chair there was still enough room to move around the room  The bathroom was clean and the hotel supplied amenities were excellent  The location of the hotel could not be better  Situated directly over the Via Rail Station and part of the Underground City makes this hotel an excellent choice 
P => NIce Hotel Great Location Very nice hotel in a great location  Asked for a room on the highest floor possible personal preference with a king bed and both requests were met  Friendly knowledgeble staff  Walk to shopping and restaurants Hotel is above main train station with access by elevator and esclator to shops and restaurants  Good options for a quick bite to eat and transportation  Easy access to Montreal Metro closest station is Bonaventure  You can access the Metro without going outside  Nice when its very cold or raining  
P => As you would expect Its a Fairmont not the most spectacular building in the chain but has all the luxury and comfort you would expect  Great cental location links to the underground network  As a tourist in town for a few days i think you could get much better value elsewhere if you are out sight seeing most of the day but a good choice if you want a touch of luxury  Bars restaurants and room service expensive  
P => Amazing Hotel My wife and i stayed at the Fairmont Queen elizabeth for  days first i always think its funny how two erate people go to the same hotel and have completly different views on the hotel  first we had a regular room on the th floor with an Amazing View  The buffet breakfest which my wife and i had twice couldnt of been better they cooked the eggs right infront of me exactly the way i asked for it the food was amazing at the hotel As far as it being too crowded i never really noticed it  The people at the hotel couldnt of been nicer helping us out with direction the only draw back was the price of parking  a day  oh well the place was great cant wait to go back 
P => Not a typical Fairmont hotel My husband and I just came back from Montreal and the Fairmont there turned out to be a big disappoinment  Since we are part of Fairmont presidents club we ided to stay the Queen Elizabeth without doing much research  I knew that there are many conferences going on in that hotel at a given time but I didnt realize how bad it was  The lobby is always crowded with tour groups blocking entrances  The elevators are always packed with guests  There are  rooms and they only have  concierge working so there is always a  minute wait  The rooms are not equipped with safe deposit boxes umbrellas and mending kits  When we asked to borrow an umbrella from the hotel they told us to go to mall and buy one since they are all out of it  What ever you do DO NOT order any room service  The Japanese breakfast we ordered contained rice thats not even done and tofu thats too rubbery to eat  The regular breakfast has been sitting around and the scrambled egg and sausage were very dry  I recommend going downstairs for breakfast buffet  We passed by the Ritz Carleton and dined in Bronte I recommend Toque and Bronte very highly in Meridien and they are better if you are looking for  star service  The lobbies of those two hotels are not crowded  You wont get the service and attention in Fairmont the Queen Elizabeth because there are just too many people staying there  
P => It was OK We had stayed there  years ago for a convention and stayed here again with the same convention  The room was probably the smallest room I have ever stayed in  The staff is wonderful the rooms are very clean and maintained very well  I probably would not stay there if I had to pay for the room because they are so small  
P => Great service and location You cant beat the Queen Elizabeth for convenience great staff and overall service  The rooms are fine    very clean and comfortable  Yes they are on the small side and they are older in or but thats no big deal    it is an older hotel  Food and beverage are pricy but you can just take the escalator down to the concourse and their are many shops and cafes where you can get a reasonable breakfast andor lunch  Its conveniently and centrally located  The staff are superior and well trained  You cant go wrong here  
P => Great Hotel in central location Booked the hotel through expedia quotmoderate roomquot  Room was very nice with comfortable bed clean excellent service  Hotel is right downtown and connected to Central Train station underground shopping etc  You cannot go wrong with the Queen E   and remember John and Yoko had their quotbed inquot at the Queen E  Instant Karma 
P => Great location in Montreal ok rooms We got a special deal on the internet for this  star hotel  I was quite excited because it had rave reviews as quite the posh hotel  When we got there we saw that the lobby was very fancy with doormen wearing white gloves etc  We checked in and went to our room  I think we got the room that went along with the special internet pricing because the room was not all that exciting  It had a couch a Queen size bed and a TV  Nothing special I have stayed in better rooms in less well reviewed hotels  There was nothing wrong or bad about it I just expected more  I have a feeling if we had paid the full room price we would have gotten a nicer room  The average clientele that we saw walking around were definately people with money so I assume they had a nicer room than us The staff was very nice to us and very helpful with any questions we had  The hotel itself is in a prime spot in Montreal  There is a train stationMetro station right below it  Right in the train station is several small resteraunts if you want to get coffee breakfast or a quick bite to eat  There is an entrance to the Underground City right across from it and a few blocks straight up from the hotel is a resteraunt and shopping area  There are also a few fancy resteraunts right in the hotel but we did not go to them  The only thing that stinks about this hotel is you have to pay  a day for parking and its only valet  The parking is a bit confusing  We ended up parking in the wrong garage  
P => Very Nice Hotel We had a very nice stay here  We upgraded to the gold level which was well worth the  additional charge  The staff is very friendly and helpful and our room was luxurious and very comfortable  The hotels cental location is excellent convenient to the historical quotold townquot as well as other areas of interest  The fitness center is well equipped and available at no additional charge  
P => Well done An excellent location for visitors to the city and a hotel that I frequent on business trips  My rating of above average probably is not all that fair in comparison to other hotels of this size  Given the Queen Elizabeths number of rooms the service is as personalised as possible  My kudos to one or two of the check in staff who have recognised me on return stays and made me feel extra welcomeThe pool and the workout facilities are great for a city hotel  Some of the rooms are a bit on the small side but most are well orated  Great shopping is nearby and there are some fantastic walks which the concierge can help you with  I recommend either going towards Mount Royal through the McGill University campus or heading south to Old Montreal and the Old Port  A great city to explore lots of good museums   and the QE is a good base of operations The food in the lobby lounge is better than one might expect and the service is prompt and very courteous  Would love to try the well reviewed fine dining restaraunt the Beaver club but have yet to have the opportunity and would note that it is frequently closed on weekend evenings   probably thanks to all the great restaraunts in Montreal  
P => Great Location and Service My boyfriend and I stayed at the Queen Elizabeth on a group rate for the Mondial de la Biere festival  Having said that I did not drink quite enough to forget what the hotel was like Luckily it was quite nice  There was a small error upon check in   I had reserved an extended King room I think thats what its called and there were two reservations under my name in the computer when I got there   one for a normal King and one for an extended Queen on a higher floor  I ended up taking the normal King since there werent any extended Kings available  The lady who checked me in was extremely attentive We got up to the room on the th floor and had a rather nice view  The windows could open a bit which was nice to check what the weather was like before going out in the morning  As others have mentioned the TV was a standard older TV which while it would have been nice were it plasma or something along those lines we didnt really spend enough time in the room to use it too much  The bathroom was a bit small but the space was utilized quite well  My only complaint was that the shower wasnt quite as luxurious as what Im used to in hotels of this calibre  I was disappointed when I saw that the bed had no fluffy duvet or featherbed or anything of that sort but the bed itself was actually very very VERY comfortable so no complaints there The doormen were also great very willing to give us directions to wherever we were going  The valet was also incredibly fast  Wed call downstairs right before we were to leave be down there just a couple minutes later and it would already be there  some of the best valet service Ive seen in a hotel Another advantage was that this hotel is connected underground to Place Ville ie which has a large food court that serve plenty of breakfast items  One of our favorites was the deli serving up smoked meat sandwiches  How can you go to Montreal and not have smoked meat Unless you dont eat meat    in which case I suppose you can passOne note that Americans should make before traveling to Canada is that you can no longer reclaim the taxes on your hotel  I hadnt realized this and was expecting to get some money back when I left so now the stay was a little more expensive than I had originally anticipated  Also one note about Montreal itself if you like beer at all be SURE to visit the Dieu du Ciel brewpub  Its just about at the corner of St  Laurent and Laurier about an  cab ride from the hotel  The beers are OUTSTANDING the service is great and the brewers are extremely friendly and willing to talk to you about their brews  
P => wonderful weekend at the QE My husband and I took his parents to Montreal for a long weekend  We choose the Queen Elizabeth because of a good rate through our travel agent  The standard rooms on the th floor were very nice  We liked being able to come and go with the car   to Olympic stadium and tower and to the top of Mount Royal  We also enjoyed exploring downtown on foot   especially the choices of restaurants  Dont miss the sculpture on McGill up the street on the right as you come out of the garage   quotThe Illuminated Crowdquot  
P => Great location but rooms are not first class This hotel is in an great location above the train station and directly connects to underground system and metro  Rate through hotels com was about half of listed price and well worth it  Although the hotel is quite nice overall some of the floors th and th seem overdue for reation  The wallpaper was pealing and carpet was worn in our th floor room  The rooms are small by todays standards  Beds and linens were fine  Furnishings adequate  View was nice and floor was relatively quiet  Service very pleasant  
P => Not a family spot Although this is a beautiful hotel and location for shopping is perfect there is nothing here for a family to do on a rainy day Weve been to Montreal countless times and thought this would outdo all other locations  We were wrong  It is geared toward conferences  The pool is a simple pool whirlpool was not working hot tub was not hot The rooms are clean be sure to reserve one that has been reated and the staff are friendly  Food is pricey but again location underground is fine for eating No simple nightlife when accompanied by a  year old  We often travel together and sit and enjoy a drink and music or entertainment or other even people watch or discussion with other people but this was not possible at the Fairmont  Nothing to do or see  Piano bar   starts later in the evening   not sure children were allowed in the lounge anyhow  
P => Gold Floors Absolutely Wonderful  My wife and I just returned from spending the Victoria Day weekend at The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal  It was the best hotel experience of our lives  We stayed two nights in one of their Gold rooms on the th floor  The room was beautifully orated and it had a wonderful view of the cathedral and surrounding downtown  Arriving by train was great We simply took an escalator and panoramic elevator to the Reception desk  Complementary breakfast beverages throughout the day and evening hors doeuvres in the Gold Lounge were all wonderful  The concierge staff was very friendly and thoughtful and dinner at The Beaver Club was exquisite  Their maitred is now our standard by whom all others are measured  Shopping was great both in nearby Old Montreal and in the City Underground linked to the hotel  
P => fairmont   fair deal Booked the hotel through airmiles in UK as offered best rate at time of reservation Our stay co incided with an extremely cold snap of weather with much slushy snow etc on the streets  Thus we were pleased to find the hotel warm  All the staff we dealt with were most friendly and helpful   especially the concierge who helped sort out excursions to Quebec city etc day trip well worth doingThe room was standard size facing Mont Royal  I agree with other trip advisor comments that upper scale hotels such as The Fairmont should now have flat screen hd tvs in the rooms  The only other comment on the room was no extractor fan in the bathroom   thus it steemed up very easily Travelling without laptop I used the business centre for internet access   charged at   plus tax per  minutes  Out of hours access is gained by collecting the key from reception The location above the railway station and linked to the underground city are excellent making it easy to get around especially during bad weather  Certainly at lunchtimes the area is packed with office workers going for lunch   but quiet at other times  The extensive food court at the rail station offers an incredible selection of eateries for all tastes  Overall a good experience  
P => Outstanding Great Location Wonderful experience Friendly helpful staff  Great safe location short walk to nearby shopping district  Room was spotlessly clean and up to date  Highly recommend it 
P => Long time ago but loved it I visited this hotel with my family a few years ago  My father had planned the vacation so I dont know rate details  However as a family of  the hotel was very accomodating  The location was great because we arrived by train  It was very easy to find considering its right above the train station  The room was very spacious and clean just like the rest of Montreal  The staff were very friendly  My siblings and I very much enjoyed the pool  Also the restaurant that was attached had very good food and I enjoyed my authentic crepes  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Great Stay at The Fairmont I stayed in Montreal for  days  were at the Le Sheraton and  were at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth  The Queen definitely was the better of the two downtown Montreal hotels I arrived early pm for a pm check in   they were very nice and accomodating and got me into a room early  We had a great view from our window of the cathedral  The other view from the hotel is Mont Royal but we didnt have the option since we were checking in early The room is very nicely designed   but lacking one thing   a flat screen   it amazes me how many upscale hotels are still offering subpar entertainment for their guests  I stayed at a hotel with an lcd tv and it really adds to the room  The entire room bedpillowsblanketdesket centerlampscurtainsbathroom were all top notch but the tv was stuck in the early s  Ok enough about the tv   the bed is comfy   yet small   they said it was a queen size   but I have a queen size bed at home and this was either a full or queen size at the Queen Liz is defined differently in Montreal The high speed internet is  for  hours   thats your average price for internet in a room so it was ok The bathroom is small but it is very nice with black tiling and very nice wood tones  The toiletries were very nice with shampooconditionerbody lotionshower cap and a shoe shiner which you will need if you venture into Montreals slushy dirty streets I ate at one of their fine restaurants Le Montr alais for lunch one day and had the mexican sandwich which was extremely good  Reasonable prices too for a very stuffy crod of people eating around us I got two words for you   creme brulee   I had room service  nights in a row because it was so damn good   they arrive promptly   minutes and show up with alot of goodies   you get alot for your money an you will spend money   for my fiance and I we spent roughly CAD CAD for each dinner   that includes a tip and taxes  We had the creme brulee and while Im not a desert nut   I have to say it was so good haha  Also try the hen off the menu   pretty good with bbq sauce and great choice of sides The lobby is very elegant and welcoming   the lobby has an area with a fireplace comfy couchesseats for reading or people watching and between pm pm daily you can have quotAfternoon teaquot  That includes tea in a china setfinger sandwiches desert etc  We didnt get the tea but it looked nice Another convenience is that the hotel is connected to the train station   just leave the lobby and take the escalator downstairs and you are in Montreals major hub   and it connects to dozen of storesrestaurants and passageways to other parts of Montreals undergound city  We were able to go shopping at the Eaton Centre without bringing our jackets in early ch when it was one day  F  WARNING DONT VENTURE INTO THE UNDERGOUND CITY BETWEEN AM PM WEEKDAYS BECAUSE IT IS VEEEEERY CROWDED AND BUSYI would definitely stay here again   recommend it when visiting Montreal and you want to splurge  But thats expected when you stay at a Fairmont chain  The staff was very friendly and helpful when we needed something towelstoothepaste etc  MERCI 
P => Convenient for a business trip but nothing special The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is in a very convenient location for a business trip  It is in the business district on a major road and the train and subway stations as well as a huge shopping mall are connected underground The one advantage of chain hotels is that you have some idea of what you will get before you ever arrive  I have stayed at other Fairmont chain hotels and this one was no different  The hotel is quite large and plush in a rather old fashioned luxury hotel type of way  When you enter either door the reception area is not immediately within view but the doormen and porters quickly direct you to the reception desk  Being in Montreal the staff first greet you in French but they are all bilingual  My French must have an obvious English accent since many of the staff switched to speaking English once they heard me speak I had a room with a king bed  The special rate I received was  for the week night and  for the weekend  The room was reasonably spacious with room for a TV and mini bar cabinet desk and chair large armchair and ottoman and space left over to set up a luggage stand  The bathroom was rather tiny  I find most hotels do not give you much shelf or counter space in the bathroom and this was no exception  Nice smelling shampoo conditioner bath gel and lotion were provided  They had a hairdryer but no bathrobe or slippers The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean  You can request turn down service in the evening  My room was away from the elevators in the middle of a long hallway facing the main street  It proved to be a quiet room Being there on business meant I did not get much opportunity to explore the hotel  There is a spa pool and gym which I did not use  I had a late meal in the bistro Montreal and a lunch in the Voyageur bar  Both meals were fairly good but not cheap  Soup was  and a sandwich  at the Voyageur  The very top end restaurant the Beaver Club is located on the ground floor The hotel room is set up for Internet but I used the business centre located in the lower lobby  It costs  for each  minutes on the Internet but when I did not take the full  minutes they waived any charge The staff are good at anticipating your needs  Taxis are hailed before you even ask and at check out someone was immediately on hand to see if I wanted to store my luggage until later The hotel is also mid distance about  blocks to the edge of Vieux Montreal and about  blocks the other way to Sherbrooke Street which has places of interest and a high end shopping areas I would recommend this for business travelers but for pleasure I prefer Vieux Montreal boutique hotels  
P => Excellent Fairmont Property Excellent property  Great location for those arriving by train as it is literally on top of the train station  Historic hotel despite being fairly modern in design and site of John Lennons famous Bed In  All around beautiful property with top notch staff  Hotel has undergone major reations in recent years and all of the common areas rooms have been very well updated  Cool and classy  Great restaurants on site but be sure to leave your hotel once and a while to eat as there are very few cities that can compete with Montreals restaurant scene  Excellent business hotel great for visiting the city  Rooms on the small side so perhaps best suited for couples singles and business travelers  I strongly recommend  
P => Reliable I wont bother with the hotel review as the comments are all accurate and I agree  What I love about this place is the food  I have traveled around the world many times and believe that this hotel has one of the best dining experiences at affordable prices that I have experienced  The Montrealais quotcoffee shopquot would put many high end european restaurants to shame  I can have a great breakfast on par with any fine hotel in the US for significantly less  I wont even bother comparing th the crud that passes for breakfast in London or Paris  I like the Montrealais so much that I even try to have my business lunches there  It has the best salad quotbarquot I have ever sampled  Salad bar is a very poor description of what is offered as the quality and selection is great  The staff quality superivison and attentiveness are on par with a deluxe asian hotel Bottom line is that this is great value for the buck  
P => The staff is the best I would highly recommend this hotel  Beautiful or great location clean rooms  Room are smaller than we are used to but I think thats the European influence  The location cant be beat with the underground shopping right down the escalator walking distance to Old Montreal and a minute cab ride to the Casino The best part of this hotel was the staff From check in to check out the friendliest cheerful helpful staff ever  We were there for the New Years weekend and the concierge was so great  The hotel was full and many people asking for help from them they were so patient and accomodating  We needed their assistance a few times and each time we walked away with a smile  They recommended and made reservations for a Thai restaurant Chao Praya   it was great I recommend this restaurant as well  
P => Very nice hotel  Great Location We stayed here over New Years Eve Weekend  I booked it through tourisme montreal com and their Sweet Deals special pay full price one night get nd night    the Queen Elizabeth was one of only a few who honored the special rate over the holiday weekend We had a standard room King sized bed  my fiance thought the room was small but it was very nice and very clean which is very important to us they also provided good information about Montreal in the room  a tourism book and a great map of the city streets that was handy Staff were very nice and professional and I would certainly stay at this hotel again  
P => Cant Beat the Location or Service This hotel shines since its takeover by Fairmont a few years ago  Fairmont stresses customer service which is not always a strong point in hotels of this size but here the staff cant wait to rush to your room with more towels bottled water whatever  The concierges front desk staff and bellmen are equally happy to give endless suggestions on where to go where to eat how to get there and so on  Im not crazy about the redone lobby design since the retro charm of the s original has been obliterated  Expect bathrooms to be small think s but rooms are comfortable and well equipped  Central location and views are unbeatable in Montreal  The lobby bar adjacent to renowned Beaver Club restaurant has had a reputation for mixing great drinks for many years  I agree with previous poster that  for parking in that cramped little garage where people wait forever to have their cars brought up is silly  You can park yourself for  at the Central Station garage just across the street Belmont in back of the hotel  
P => Stay on the Gold Floors My Husband and I met his sister and dhter  at this hotel in central Montreal  The hotel sits on top of the train station and has elevator service to the station and all its shops  In addition there is easy access to all of Montreal including the underground parts of the city  For a few extra dollars we stayed on the Gold Floors which is a hotel within a hotel  A complimentary lovely breakfast is served daily and a snack buffet in the evening in the guest lounge  The concierges go out of their way to help you  The hotel had ADA rooms that are truly accessible  There is an indoor pool and health club  The hotel has its own parking garage  Overall a great place to stay in a city full of fun for all  Although some of the restaurants in the City are pricey and not kid friendly  The city has wheelchair accessible vans to take you places if you need it  Though ask the price before you order the cab  The hotel has AAA discounts   or in Canada CAA  
P => A hotel of genuine class Dont be put off by the Fairmonts considrable size   this is a gorgeous hotel that manages to feel much smaller than it actually is a good thing  The quality of service is the best Ive ever experienced in that the staff all of them are genuinely friendly as opposed to fake friendly  One can clearly see that the hotel management take their staff training very seriously indeed The or throughout is carefully thought out and beautifully understated the beds comfortable bathrooms well appointed although the shower was a little lacking  A complaint about the bedide lamps being too dim to read by was immediately addressed Finally the Queen Elizabeth oozes character possibly because scores of world dignitaries have stayed there including the Queen Mother  If it was good enough for her its good enough for me Highly recommended and I wouldnt want to stay anywhere else if I go back to Montreal  
P => Good business hotel We were here for a conference from ember rd to the th of this year  The room was relatively nice  I especially liked the opening window a feature that one does not see very often anymore  Unfortunately that did not help cool the room the temperature was always over C and we never turned the heat on once That made sleeping a little hard  The bed was comfortable enough and our request for foam pillows was immediatley looked after  The bathroom had  bathrobes which was nice but one practically had to leave the room to put them on as it was very small  The room had a wired internet connection available for a charge but free for those people who had joined their no cost membership club which I did  Local calls were also free for club members  I tried to use my vonage equipment without success I suppose because their connection requires a log on  The desk was large enough for my laptop and papers and there was ent lighting in the room We had a number of meals during our business conference and they were all good especially the pastries diet time again  The parking is expensive no surprise there and we did the valet parking for  per day as we needed in and out rights You can get almost anywhere in the downtown core underground in the passages especially if you know your way around them  You need never put on your coat and woolies  remember that Montreal does get cold in the winter 
P => Central Location in Montreal The QE is in an attractive location in downtown Montreal  Rooms are small with very little drawer space  Make sure you join Farimont Club by website before arriving amp will not have to pay for local phone calls  Desk staff are very attentive amp knowledgable amp housekeeping does an excellent job  Concierge is very helpful  Go downstairs and u are in Montreals underground city connected to all the malls  This is the best way to traverse the city in the cold months  Montrealais Restaurant is a good value in the hotel  Hotel is walking distance to all the restaurants on Montagne Drummond etc  Parking in hotel is expensive at  Cdnnt  Also a surprise was that during rush hour u cannot drop off car in front of hotel to valet  
P => Great service great location at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth We stayed at the Queen Elizabeth for a weekend stay from Friday to Sunday  Booked via the Fairmont website Very convenient as we arrived by train to Gare Centrale Central Station walked two minutes through the food court area of the station and were on the elevator to the main lobby of the hotel  The staff upon check in were very pleasant  Very nice room  Not huge however well appointed with comfortable bed desk and large closet  Bathroom was small but very modern with a nice shower Breakfast was included in our package which was in the Montrealais Restaurant  A very nice buffet with the usual hot regulars eggs bacon however had a Quebecois specialty butter maple crepes which were excellent  The buffet had a good variety of fruits breads and cereals  Excellent tasting and very good attentive service The pool and fitness equipment are located on the lower level so one has to switch elevators at the lobby level  A bit inconvenient  However a nice pool hot tub and kiddy pool  Lots of fitness equipment including four tredmills  Very close to the Metro either Bonaventure Orange Line which is accessible via the quotUnderground Cityquot or McGill station Green Line about four blocks away   Only two blocks from St  Catherine Street the main shopping street  Very good location close to everything Overall excellent experience at the Fairmont  
P => Fairmont Queen Elizabeth   great for train travellers Our family of four stayed here early ust  Although the room was a little compact for us and our luggage it was of a very high standard and had lovely views up towards Mont Royal  The main advantage for us as we were touring across Canada was the proximity of the train station as our train in was two hours late it was great to only be a few steps from our hotel  Also when we left our train was an hour late departing so we could wait in the comfort of the hotel lobby rather than in line downstairs in the station  The gym there was the best equipped of the hotels we stayed in and the pool was lovely and deserted mid morning each weekday if you want a quiet swim and get a few laps inThe station beneath the hotel and the adjoining shopping centre provide a huge choice of dining options and this was another big advantage of this hotel  Our package included breakfast at the hotel which had an excellent choice   something to suit the whole family but we ate out each evening  Especially worth mentioning was Katz restaurant in the shopping centre   the best steaks we have had and extremely good value The Fairmont was also in a great location for seeing all the sights with almost everything within walking distance and the tube system nearby for longer trips All the staff we had contact with were extremely friendly and helpful and housekeeping were very prompt at rectifying any oversights   extra towels delivered within ten minutes of calling  All in all thoroughly recommended  
P => Excellent Choice in Downtown We stayed at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth from ust th to th  Our reservation was made through Expedia and we got an excellent rate of  a night for a Fairmont Room  After arriving on Amtraks Adirondack train from New York it was extremely convenient to take the escalator right up from Central Station into the hotel  The train was an hour and  minutes late making us even more eager to relax  There were a few guests ahead of us on the check in line some coming from the same train we were on  The woman who checked us in was extremely pleasant and helpful  We were given a room on the th floor and took the elevators up  Upon arriving at the room I was wondering whether it would be too small  I had read a number of previous reviews which stated that the room and bathroom would be cramped  I was pleasantly surprised  The room wasnt large but there was more than adequate space for two double beds a desk and chair armoire with TV cabinet and an extra chair in the corner  The bathroom was a little tight but well done with ble tile on the floor and tub walls  The room had a spectacular view overlooking Rene Levesque Blvd  If you were to look to the north McGill Universitys campus is straight ahead  Finally looking even further north you are afforded an amazing view of Mount Royal Park  Any first time visitor to Montreal must visit Mount Royal  The views of the city are breathtakingThe hotel is connected to Montreals vast quotUnderground Cityquot giving hotel guests easy access to shopping restaurants and metro stations  Although the Bonaventure station on the Orange Line is closer to the hotel we found the McGill station on the Green Line to be more convenient  We did not eat at either of the two restaurants in the hotel but a quick check of their menus showed them to be rather expensive  Eggspectations on Blvd de la Maisonneuve is a great choice for breakfast with large portions  Overall the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is an excellent choice for both business and leisure travellers alike  
P => Wonderful Stay This was the first Fairmont I had ever stayed at and I can never go back to regular hotels again  The beds in the standard room are huge  The rooms are georgously orated and positively luxurious  We stayed here during one of the nastiest snow storms Quebec had seen in  and felt completely content and cozy as we watched the snow fall on the city  We had a pretty view from a higher lever th floor I believe  The hotel is connected to the underground shopping system except for a small section that you have to walk outside  Its not quite as close to St  Catherines as we would have liked but still a very good location and convenient to old Montreal  I got an excellent rate but I would have stayed here even at regular price  It was worth every penny 
P => A Queen Above the Rails After a very long and trying day traveling by train from New York we arrived at the Montreal station exhausted and grateful that we were staying right upstairs at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth  Extremely helpful VIA Rail personnel assisted us with our luggage and escorted us right to the front desk  The registration process was quick and very friendly  Although I can speak French I was so tired that I wasnt sure I could muster the energy  Without any hint of Parisian condenscension the staff conversed easily and congenially in English  They allowed me my poor attempts at French and filled in words in a helpful but not snotty manner Our room was quiet and well appointed with a view of the river  I was sorry that the hotel lacked the grandeur of an old building but the tasteful or made up for architecture  We had a small meal of delicious French onion soup and wine and yummy bar snacks of wasabi peas exotic crackers and nuts while listening to the jazz pianist in the lobby bar  Th next morning we were enjoying our stay so much that we postponed our train trip to Quebec City to luxuriate in our room  We ordered breakfast from room service and had quotLe Jockeyquot with yogurt shredded wheat fresh Quebec strawberries coffee and juice  After breakfast I wandered down to the underground shopping complex adjacent to the hotel a great thing in winter I would bet and changed currency  A nice alternative to eating in the hotel would be to peruse the deli like stands in the train station  
P => Friendly and consistent service From the moment we checked into the hotel all the staff were consistently very warm and friendly  Our room was turned down at night and the room service was prompt and delicious  The hotel is conveniently located only a short distance from shopping along St  Catherines and old montreal making it easy to get around  The concierge was very helpful and gave us the best routes to our destinations around the city  The only downfall was our room was a little smaller than expected  you couldnt open the door and get into the closet at the same time and if you couldnt get out of the washroom if the closet door or the front door was open  However all the furnishings were beautiful and we had a great view of the city  Overall I loved my stay at the Queen Elizabeth  The welcoming and friendly staff made my stay a great one  I definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Wonderful location The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth in Montreal is a lovely hotel  The location is wonderful   an easy walk to either Old Montreal and the harbor or the downtown shoppingMagill University area  The rooms and baths are somewhat small but very very nice and the staff is great  The hotel is also located directly over one of the main stops of the underground transportation system so you can jump on a train for a minimal price and get to almost any place you want  There are also stores in the train station so you can pick up personal items in a pharmacy buy a gift or grab a snack for a very nominal price  
P => Give it a pass  too many other good choices  My wife and I have stayed in almost   of the Fairmont hotels this is one of the ones you can easily pass by  Yes good location in city and above train station with access to Metro and Underground City  But its a huge behemoth youll find yourself lost in a lobby of conventioneers local media affairs and bused tourist groups  Pie eyed tourists leaving the afternoon tini special bump into elderly dowagers finishing their tea while Canadian TV sets up an inside camera station  Even the Gold Floor here is on two floors with almost  rooms theres insufficient seating space in the Lounge at the busiest breakfast times and needy elderly tourists who arrive sans guidebooks or maps camp at the concierge desk endlessly  Our rooms were not turned down at night our shoes put out for shining were lost on two mornings and not returned til after am the concierge said quotall restaurants were goodquot without helping us further as others were waitingto talk to him  Our rooms had copious magazines on Canadian wine and BMWs but despite two days of requests never had maps or local area events booklets  None of this is a deal killer for staying here but with the absolute wealth of boutique hotels in the Old Town alone smaller more attentive closer to water why would you want to fight crowds and indiscriminate service We tried this visit as we got a special   off the third night with freebies from Montreal Tourism however no one at the hotel knew anything about the free gifts although we did get the   off  Do what we normally do book in at the St Sulpice or its like use the Champs de s Metro a few blocks away and just relax 
P => Fine Like the previous posters said this hotel is perfunctory    service is fine lobby is nice rooms are small but clean not memorable  Location is great right under the Central Station which made it convenient for us to get to Quebec City near metro lines and close to Rue de Catherine and walkable to Old Montreal  By the way there is a gym in the hotel I used it and it was very nice  No gift shop to speak of so if you need a little something you had to go out for it I never use minibars think it is one of the worlds biggest ripoffs I ate at the Montrealis in the hotel and have to say both the food amp service were wondeful that was my experience Would I go back no but if you are looking for an excellent location you cant top this  If I ever go back to Montreal I will stay in the old section  
P => surprise a Grand Hotel thats grand My wife and I splurged on a ior Suite and it was worth the extra cost  The hotel people were wonderful especially the concierges and the waiters at the more than coffee shop the Montrealais  Location is super  On rainy days there are kilometers of underground shopping easily reached adjacent to the hotel the train station is also quotattached quot And on sunny days the Frederick Law Olmstead designed Mont Royal Park gem of the city is  or  minutes away uphill by foot  Other fine dining relatively close on dry days including the incomparable Toque as is Old Montreal with all of its delights  
P => A great monolithic block We stayed here Family of  to visit relatives  This hotel is right in the middle of downtown close to Old Montreal  If you are looking for one of those old historical Fairmonts you will be dissapointed  If you are looking for a clean modern luxury hotel you will not The exterior is a monolithic block as a previous reviewer pointed out  The lobby had a nice lounge area where you could just sit on the big fancy couches and talk all you like even be served afternoon tea  The Queeny is directly linked to the huge Underground City and a subwyt station  The Underground City is a huge mall for those of you who dont know  The restuarant Montrealalis didnt have great food but the service was superb as with the rest of the hotels staff  They went above and beyond to make our stay better  The room was a little on the small side but it was tolerable  The room apeared to be clean but you got the sense that it was dusty and hadnt been used for a long time  It was nothing special  The internet wasnt free though most hotels now have it for free  The bathroom was huge with all the amenaties you could need  We would defenatly stay here again  
P => A Wonderful Stay Stayed at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth il   and then again from     The rooms are small but are very clean  The staff are excellent to deal with  They are polite and helpfull at all times  Rue St  Catherine is only a few blocks away  You can walk to Crescent Street and its a short Metro ride to Old Montreal and Rue St Deni  I would reccommend this hotel to anyone  Make sure you ask about a corporate rate  We stayed for   Canadian  
P => Okay but not memorable My stay at the Queen Elizabeth was fine  Not outstanding not memorable but fine On the plus side staff were incredibly helpful and professional  I was impressed with everyone I dealt with The interior of the hotel is mediocre  The exterior is a great s international style design but the lobby is an odd pastiche of various design styles with lots of hotel cliches thrown in  Given the history of the place and the fact that it was once THE place to stay in Montreal it is a shame that they didnt have a high caliber design team do something spectacular or original with the interior  Similarly the rooms were fine but nothing to write home about The Queen Elizabeth meet expectations but did not exceed them  A hotel of this caliber and history ought to do more than perfunctorily fill the role of forgetable big city hotel  There are so many great hotels in this city all of which offer their guests a unique and memorable stay so I cant imagine that I would bother staying at the QE again  They didnt do anything wrong but they did nothing to entice me back  
P => Bring your earplugs      I stayed  nights at this hotel for a oonference during the last weekend in ch  The hotel staff is welcoming and professional and the or in the meeting rooms was very good  a cut above the usual  But      It is nice to be able to sleep in your hotel room  Mine had paper thin walls  It was a large queen room on the th floor  The first morning while I was reading the newspaper I heard very distinctly apparently next to my ear quotA Polish Good Morningquot It was the man in the room next door making a phone call  One hears every syllable of even quiet conversations through the wall  I slept with the radio on it was pre tuned to a classical station set at low volume  I think the hotel is aware of this wall problem to drown out all the noise   A more minor gripe The quality of the linens was not what one would expect in a four star hotel  an old buff blanket pilled and ragged was wrapped inside the sheet   Nice features The bed itself was comfortable  The Fairmont teas are excellent  some are supplied near the coffeemaker and I was able to purchase some in the lobby gift shop too  The shuttle bus from the airport not only drops off at the hotel door but picks up there without requiring prior reservations  The underground food courts are convenient and affordable and it was good to have an alternative to the costly food in the hotel  The subway system underground is easy to use clean and safe and it is right under the hotel as is the Central rail station  The distance to the Old Town several milesis a bit of a drawback to someone at a QE based conference  as it is hard to slip out for much more than an hour or two  The Old Town itself is not as compact as Id hoped it would be so it was hard to see much in a short time  The hotel itself is located in the downtown area which is not distinctive looking  In the hotel I had dinner in the Montrealer Bistro where the service was verrrrry sllllooowww and the food rather costly and fancy quotbistroquot is a misnomer but good  Drinks in the bar were expensive but outstanding  great ambiance there   In all this hotel has some attractive features particularly the nicely designed public spaces  But when traveling on business getting ones rest is important and the room for  of the  nights was as noisy a room as Ive ever had in a hotel for a rather high cost  The elevators were not working at mid day for two of the conference days there was also a power outage on my floor one day  a serious inconvenience when ones room is on the th floor  So     I probably will stay elsewhere if I return to Montreal  
P => Perfect Service at an Excellent Hotel Well   in a nut shell this was the best hotel ever to have stayed in  I do a lot of travel with business and have not come across such good service before in a city hotelperhaps Im unlucky  We stayed in a Fairmont room   which have recently been done up  Very comfartbale excellent bed   slight down side   the TV and combine fridge cabinet kinda dominates the room On the wrong side of town from the good things to see the Fairmont is in the Downtown commercial district of Montreal   that said this is overcome with a pair of comfy shoes and coat in winter and the use of the tube system  
P => Great hotel From the outside it looks rather small and tranquile but once on the inside it booms with life I stayed in the Gold rooms so I can only talk for the service in relation to that area  The concierge was very friendly the lounge is nice and clean while having very goodcourteous service  The rooms are not very big but they have what you need  I enjoyed the complimentary coffee and water bottle  The cherry on the sunday was that beautiful elevator reserved for Gold club rooms its made out of glass and is transparent on all sides making it so pretty to go up or down floors  Pool and gym are very nice also  I recommend strongly  
P => Stay at one of the amazing boutique hotels The Fairmont is pretty but when I go back I will stay at Le Saint Sulpice or Hotel Nelligan  There are too many amazing boutique hotels in Montreal to waste your time here  Firstly the rooms are incredibly small  The bathroom is a closet  I will say on a good note the staff is excellent  I met three or four concierges here and they were all excellent Not bad but I did expect more  
P => What housekeeping The hotel is well located Our room was small but fine However our king sized bed had a full sized blanket on it stretched width wise  I called housekeeping the next morning and requested a king sized blanket and was told it would be taken care of  It wasnt  We had to pull out the spare blanket also full and overlap them  The maid then continued to make up the bed that way for the remainder of our stay The blankets were of very poor quality to boot Then when the maid refreshed the bathroom she didnt replace the wash clothes  
P => Outstanding reation for a classic hotel I recently stayed at the Queen Elizabeth and was amazed at the recent reation to this Montreal landk  I had stayed there years ago and the property was becoming a bit tired  Not so today The rooms lobby Beaver club restaurant were all outstanding with tasteful style and overall great service  The staff was attentive and caring  I was very impressed with the style of of room and certainly the hotel location  The food in Room Service and for breakfast were excellent  We made a special occasion to go the acclaimed Beaver Club and we were not let down  Gourmet dining with unsurpassed service  Incredible food quality  Overall the hotel was impressive for its service style location staff attitude and services  Great health club  I recommend to everyone  You will not be let down  This is a famous hotel with years of history that is now very tastefully orated with very well trained staff  
P => Quite good Stayed there for four nights in ust on a business trip  One major problem and basically the only real problem was that sound proofing is way below average  At least it was on my quotnormal roomquot might be different in suites etc  Hotel is built in the s and you can hear it For example traffic noise from  floors below could be very well heard not to mention screaming teenagers from the room next to mine    Room was quite spacious and clean clearly that was updated a couple of years ago  Situation is ideal hundreds of stores restaurants bars are within walking distance  Also Molson Centre or whatever it is called nowadays is very close for hockey fans  One thing though Im suprised that some reviewer said that hotel lobby is special  To me there was absolutely nothing special there a very typical one floor high hall without anything particular to see  
P => Excellent Hotel Stayed  nights with family of  and had a Jr  Suite and standard room  Rooms are a little small  Service was excellent from check in to Check out  Pool was a little small for the kids but all and all a great Hotel  
P => Great Hotel and Location Centrally located on Rene Levesque Bl  and right atop the train and shopping underground  Breakfast was an easy pleasure by taking the hotel elevator all the way down  Endless wonderful coffee and pastry shops as far as the eye could see  Staff was always friendly and courteous  Room was clean and quiet with a great view  Somewhat small but large enough for   Parking garage staff was always friendly and never had to wait for our car  Montreal is a great city and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel is a great venue from which to explore the city  
P => ent hotel For those of you who dont know this hotel is a Montreal landk that has been there for more than  years it was a CN Hotel managed by Hilton for a long time Fairmont took it over within the last  years  The location of the hotel is very convenient for walking around downtown and old Montreal  The hotel is not particularly attractive from the outside  I understand that rds of the floors have been updated and those rooms cost more  I stayed in an older room which was ok not great bed was comfortable bathroom was fine and clean very nice view of the large church adjacent  Depending on the rate you can get this is a good choice of hotel  There are some new boutique style hotels in Old Monteal that are very nice but pricy  Also this hotel is very convenient to the underground city and central train station and metro stations you dont have to go outside at all if you dont want to  I ate at the Beaver Club restaurant in the hotel it was one of the best meals I have ever had and I have eaten at some very nice places  The fixed price  course meal paired with regional wines was absolutely fantastic with impeccable service incredible local ingredients were used mostly and I cannot praise the Beaver club enough absolutely first class you cannot get better food anywhere  Prices are high but for a treat well worth it  
P => Avoid in general especially on Grand Prix weekend We booked an expensive trip to Montreal for the Formula  Grand Prix  As its just about impossible to find a ent hotel in the city on Grand Prix weekend we chose from a list provided by the race organisers  The QE looked the classiest hotel so we took up the offer at CAD  per night with a three night mininum  We were checked in to a tiny room with the smallest bathroom Ive ever seen in a hotel of any class  The or was Seventies style and the wear and tear seemed to confirm this as the period of installation  It was the middle of a heatwave mid eighty degrees and our air conditioner failed to produce any cold air at all leaving us to fan ourselves for most of the night  Our in bath shower head didnt work and every flush of the toilet flooded the bathroom  After the second night we were told that we would be moved to an quotupgradedquot room  This was a room of the same pokey size with the same tiny bathroom but the or was new and fairly pleasant though this air con also failed to produce anything resembling cold air so another night in a sauna  There were some positives check in and out was very smooth for a busy weekend and room service was excellent   fast a full menu some guidance from the person taking the order quotno need for a side salad sir it already comes with onequot but for a hotel claiming a five star rating and chargingover CAD  a night there seems no reason to gamble on being booked into one of tacky unrefurbed rooms  Even the post refurb rooms and particularly the bathrooms are way smaller than one will find at most other hotels in the city  
P => wrong room but lovely When we got there we got to our room tried from a long trip we call them road trips this one we travled from Georgia to Montrealwe saw there were ash trys in the bathroom so i thought the french people love to smoke So i tallked to the front desk and they said they messed up expedia dident so we got a room smaller by a foot in another side fo the hotel but the view was MUCH better The Breakfast Buffet is to die for with butler like peropl with the best hot tea ever and it is connected underground to everything al in al it was the best hotel ive ever stayed at i would defently suggest it My son loved itP S  the picture is ot the view in our second room 
P => Perfect Location This was our first trip to Montreal for a quick getaway  The location of the Fairmont could not be better  Underground access to the train and the underground city  The airport shuttle left us right in front of the hotel  Shopping restaurants and tours were in comfortable walking distance  The staff was extremely pleasant accomodating and knowledgeable  The interior elegantly orated  If you want elegance service access and convenience the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is the place to stay 
P => Not in good weather If you will be in Montreal in the worst weather then the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is a good choice because of your connection to the undergound city  You can walk all over town without showing your face in the brutal Montreal winter  Otherwise the QE has awful service housekeeping is a shambles and has a pretty bad attitude  THe room is nothing special though some have nice enough views  Ours had a view of the church next door which was very nice  The food in the main restaurant is atrocious for Montreal where even the little holes in the wall can ussually serve up a good meal  We had coupons for the breakfast buffet and it was not very good at all  No comparison to Hotel de la Montaign or Hotel Vogue  We were there for three nights and there was a plastic coffee stirrer on the carpet near our room for all  days  
P => loved the Queen Elizabeth Stayed at the Fairmont in Montreal in uary and had a great time The service was excellent and the rooms although a little small were fabulous The concierge Joel was very helpful and really went the extra mile for us I would recommend this hotel to anyone on business or if you simply want to be in the middle of it all  
P => Very comfortable and great location I usually stay in the old city but for business this location was much more convenient  I was only recommended to this hotel because of its locatation really  Admittedly I stayed in the Gold section but I was really comfortable and can only speak very highly of Eric the manager there  My room was lovely and my entire stay was great  Perfect for a lady travelling alone   
P => The Queen E is still noting to write home about I read some of the recent reviews which indicated that the Queen Elizabeth was rising like a phoenix from the ashes of some pretty rough years  Well its not there yet Im in a suite   admittedly a IOR suite but its TINY  Im not a big guy around  quot and  pounds but some of the corners are tought to navigate and the bathroom is really snug The room is fine no huge complaints but Ive had MUCH nicer standard rooms at several other Montreal hotels My advice go to Hotel Vogue or Le Germain for a great place at what is still a reasonable rate  
P => Excellent service  The Queen Elizabeth is one of Montreals gems  The hotel is well located down town with easy walking to shops amp restaurants  A tunnel connects to the train station amp the underground shopping  Dinner at the Beaver Club restaurant is a treat amp I cant say enough about the service we received there  I will deffinately return to the Queen Elizabeth  
P => Great location for winter shopping We went to the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth ember  and greatly appreciated your stay  We were looking to do some serious shopping and the location couldnt be better The hotel is linked to all of the underground links that allows you to walk to the different building without ever going outside  That was a major convinience and allowed us to leave the boots gloves coat in the hotel room and walk to many of the shoping centers on bldv Ste Catherine without suffering from the  C cold  There was also and art and craft exibit in Place Bonneaventure and exibith hall just few blocks from the hotel also accessible using the underground passages Kids did appreciate the indoor pool although not exceptional it did allowed to keep them busy while the mother was shopping for the chrismas presents  Just under the hotel is the train station which might be a convenience for many  We used our car and found the hotel parking to be very expensive though The room wasnt particullary large but nothing particular to complain though  If room size  conform is key you might find better hotels in montreal though  
P => Very Nice Stay    Pleasantly surprised with Queen Elizabeth had stayed there  years ago with mixed thoughts  After hearing about their reations ided to try again with great results  Beautiful room with beautiful view and great value for under   
P => Fantastic My fiance and I stayed at the Queen Elizabeth in ember  and we were ried in the local Court House during our stay  The staff found out about our wedding and provided us with complimentary champagne and strawberries dipped in chocolate  They were all so friendly and the hotel absolutely stunning   we loved it so much we are going back in il   
P => Back at the Top of Montreals Hotels The Queen E  has gotten a wonderful makeover that should put it at the top of Montreals hotel options once again This property has been reorated and the results are quite impressive  From the lobby to the rooms or and design are elegant and furnishings are in mint condition  The staff all have a renewed enthusiasm for their work ranging from more friendly attitudes at the front desk to improved cleaning of rooms etc  And the Beaver Club remains one of Canadas best restaurants  
P => All in All a great stay My husband and I just returned from a trip to Montreal  We stayed at the Queen Elizabeth on tember  and   We found the hotel to be very nice  We did not find the lobby dark as one review stated  It was fascinating to walk from the hotel to the underground tunnel to explore the many shops and restaurants without ever going outside  Also a very short walk to St Catherine Street where there are many outside cafes and shops  We had a room on the top floor with a king size bed a couch and a spectacular view of the city  The room was quite spacious although if I have one negative it would be the small bathroom but the room and view made up for it  One night we ate at the Beaver Club and it was an awesome dining experience one I do not believe I will have again for a long time  The lounge was very nice as well with a piano player and very nice ambiance to sit and have a nightcap  Most of the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly especially the concierge except for one bad apple the day we left  The bellhop that came to get our bags was very rude  He brought our bags down to the lobby so he told us he would do and we went for breakfast  After breakfast when we asked about our luggage the lobby staff told us the bellman must have taken our bags down to the parking garage because they were not left in the lobby  However when askedthe parking garage attendant did not have our bags and had to find out where they were  The rude bellhop eventually arrived with our bags  When my husband gave him a   tip one toonie he just stood there with his hand out looking for more and when we did not oblige and he observed me handing the parking attendant a   bill for his help the bellman made several faces and comments in french  After arriving at our new destination Quebec I realized that a souvenir that I had purchased in Montreal a  hat I bought for my mother was missing  We called the Queen Elizabeth and they did return our call but told us that they had checked with lost and found and the maid staff and the hat was not foundMy husband thinks the bellman took it  The other criticism I would make is and as other reviews have noted there is a fire alarm that goes off every night with a recording that tells you they are checking an internal alarm there is no need to leave your room and please stand by  Minutes later the alarm goes off again and they tell you everything is clear  This happened at  a m  the first night and  a m  the second night  It was very annoying to say the least  However all in all it was a great stay and I would stay there again  
P => Great location and friendly staff The Fairmont in Montreal is recently reated and located right downtown near the best shopping  I had a view on the adjacent cathedral and Sunlife building which was fabulous  I stayed on Fairmont Gold and was treated as royalty  Its like a boutique hotel inside the big hotel  Our room was modern with a great ble bathroom I wish I had at home  The concierges were very friendly helpful and their advice was priceless  We had dinner in the hotels Beaver Club and had the best experience  We rarely find service like that anymore and the food was exceptional  It was a treat but well worth it  The hotel also has a nice pool and gym club to unwind  
P => Great service but less than appealing room for the price  I have stayed at other Fairmont city properties most recently in San Francisco and San Jose California so I had some high expectations  The Queen Elizabeth in Montreal did not come close  The lobby was dark  The front desk staff always seemed to be stressed even at AM  The rooms I had guests in several rooms were VERY SMALL in comparison to the BIG room rate  What does make this Fairmont property live up to the Fairmont reputation were the courteous doormen cheerful phone personnel and pleasant room attendants I called for extra towels constantly  In sumy Location is great underground train station is two levels below the hotel  Pleasant staff and great service the front desk staff just needs to be a little less anxious  Rooms too small for the price  
P => Great Location My family stayed at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth for a vacation as suggested by our travel agent  We could not have been more pleased with the hotel  Although there were fancier hotels in the area we were impressed with the friendly staff and elegant accomodations  The exercise room free for guests had a large selection of equipment and was very clean  The location was also perfect   Our hotel was connected with the Metro and a short walk from all the sites we were interested in seeing during the trip  
P => Magnifique Contrary to the bad reviews Ive read our experience at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth was great  Bear in mind that this is a s era hotel with quite a history  John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged their second famous week long quotbed inquot on    in suite     Granted that some parts of this enormous building need a spot of upkeep the service at least during our stay was gracious in the Fairmont tradition  Our one bedroom executive suite on the th floor was beautifully orated in a continental yet modern motif with warm wood furniture and black ble bathrooms with chrome fixtures  From the suites cleanliness and the condition of the furniture I suspect it had been reated recently  The king bed was wonderful   but the food was fantastic We used room service twice try the filet mignon the breakfast buffet in the Montrealais restaurant was delicious too especially the croissants and freshly baked breads  The best part of this hotel for us was its location  You can walk directly from the lower level into the Place Ville ie underground shopping mall and from there you can walk into a series of interconnecting malls that span the center of the city  Also the proximity to ie Reine Du Monde Cathedral is great    all in all this place is the ideal French Canadian experience in the heart of Montreal   
P => Needs TLC The Queen Elizabeth is not what we were expecting  We were expecting a  star beautiful city hotel and instead we found a hotel that needed loads of reations  We had a room in the old section and it looked like the bedding and the carpet were out of the s  It was dissappointing  But its location is good but not worth the money spent  
P => Needs work to become the place again  As one who has stayed over in the city many times I have to agree with those who say that the or strikes one as being out of the s  The Queen has been supplanted by the Lowes Vogue or the Delta as the place to be in the city  The rooms arent particularly big for a luxury hotel  The one plus to this place is a large pool and a nicely equiped gym  Like all those others expect to spend Cday on top of the listed price for the taxes parking and whatnot  If you arent addicted to five star service and want the real Montreal experience Id prefer the Chateau dArgoat to all of them   
P => There are better hotels in the area   avoid this one if you can  Dont let the appearances mislead you   fire alarms throughout the night   valet parking at night and our car got scratched     for in room internet access some hotels in the area offer this FREE   charge   per call for toll free numbers   prices for breakfast are extremeDo yourself a favour and take a moment to look at other hotels in the same area that offer better customer service and facilities  
P => Overall very nice This is the most centrally located hotel in Montreal  If you want to be in the middle of things stay here  What we didnt like  The lobby wasnt impressive and I was amazed at how much nicer the other areas of the hotel were  What we did like Once you leave the lobby everything gets nicer  The rooms are really special we stayed in a mini suite it was like two rooms for the price of one and the restaurants are supurb  The pool is nice but can get noisy if theres too many people  The hotel is situated right over the nicest underground shopping are in Montreal  The hotel elevators actually go right down into the train station and shopping promenade  The elevators are suprisingly fast you wont have to wait even on a high floor  If you can forget about the lobby who cares about it anyway than this is the place for you  
P => Great Hotel The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is in a great location and within walking distance to shops easy access to underground shops and train The service was excellent the concierge was extremely helpful Definitely will stay again  
P => Gold Service in Montreal My room on the Gold level of the Queen E  was very stylish  Use of the private salon for RampR was great for me and my wife  
P => Fairmount Queen Elizabeth A little expensivebut this was a splurge for my wife and me  And so worth it  The Hotel was in Downtownand was connected to the entire quotundergroundquot of trainsmetroshopping and food  The concierge service was great  The Hotel was minutes from the Quebec tourist info center where we cht the double ker bus for a great tour  Tickets were good for two daysso after getting the quotlay of the landquot we used the bus like a taxi to get on and off all over the city  The entire week was superb friendly people excellent food and good shopping bargains

P => Perfectly Fine in Every Way We were very happy with our one night weekend stay  The purpose of our trip was to take teenaged dhters and their friends to the Biodome and go shopping etc  We availed ourselves of the Ptite Folie package i e  one room for  and a second at     hard to beat those rates Also the underground parking was only   which is ent for a large city  All in all it was perfect for our purposes  It was well located in relation to the restaurants on St  Denis the rooms were clean and comfortable although not luxurious and the bathrooms not spacious but this didnt matter to us  Travellers from abroad mightnt have been happy with our view but we werent there for that either  The pool and exercise facilities were nice and we did use them no hot tub but a sauna  The check in and out were smooth with no waiting although we observed that the line ups ebbed and flowed  We had minimal interaction with the staff and didnt eat there so we cant comment on these aspects  We didnt find the area particularly seedy nor did we have trouble with pan handlers outside or bedbugs inside  It was good basic accommodation for a weekend trip and wed definitely consider staying there again  
P => Bed Bugs I always stay at the Gouverneur Hotel when I go to Montreal  Although this time when we came back late in the night and pulled away the blankets we found the sheets covered in bedbugs I have to admit that the staff dealt with this pretty well and offered to wash all of our clothes and transferred us into an even better room I know this is a problem that happens often and the hotel is greatly located and very adequate for weekend getaways  Breakfast buffet is too expensive and always cold  There are many great little restaurants in the area  
P => A touch of class and value We really liked staying at this hotel PROS  Front desk staff very friendly and helpful and they dont mind speaking English too  Concierge staff also very friendly and helpful stored our luggage for free  A lot of amenities high speed internet  hour room service pool fitness all included  Nice rooms with beautiful views soft towels and even a pants press   Convenient location  Close to the Berri UQAM station   IGA superket attached to the hotelCONS  Immediate area surrounding the hotel is quite seedy  We were approached by homeless people on multiple occasions  
P => Pleasant but a little tired The hotel lobby upon our arrival seemed quite cramped and dated but the staff at the reception were friendly  The hotels location is fine and especially handy as it is directly connected to the M tro system and and shopping centre with a superket Our room was of a good size and had a fantastic view over the city of Montr al  Everything about the room was rather s but it was comfortable nonetheless  The bathroom was clean and the toiletries provided are excellent The hotels swimming pool is nice and has a good view out thanks to its elevated location When we were leaving the concierge was quite stroppy in the whole process of ordering us a taxi and dealing with our baggage which was a shame However in all the hotel was perfect for our needs and it was an enjoyable stay  
P => Location good if you like using the Metro Stayed in the Gouverneur Dupuis for  nights  We paid   euro extra for a superior room on the th floor for  nights and we got a cold buffet included in that which I thought it was worth it  Rooms was spacious toilet was on the small side but was fine  The thing that annoyed us was the water in the bathroom was not very hot  The cold buffet was good all you can eat fruit cereal and bread which we were happy with  Location is just ok but becuase you are above a metro station you can go to alot of places in Montreal using the metro and you can get a one day pass for  or  day pass for  i think  Overall we enjoyed our stay and the staff in the hotel were good  What we really liked about the hotel was we got early check in at pm and late checkout pm which was great and the free wireless was good too  
P => lovely hotel pity about the nickel and dime policy I cant ault this hotel on location comfort or service  its not cheap but it offers good value  I stayed in a superior suite on the th floor with wonderful view over montreal  So Overall my review must read as very positive  I have one or two gripes st when taxes and parking were added on it put almost  on my bill of  for  days  I know this is part of the CRAZY policy of giving prices excluding tax in both USA and Canada  and nowhere else for obvious reasons cos its stupid  But I would recommend using a site that includes these charges or contacting the hotel directly to find the final bill nd They charge arately for breakfast depending on wheather you have a cold or hot buffet breakfast This might be ok in a cheap hotel but feels very nickle and dime when you have to bring a voucher for breakfast each morning  Which if you forget as i did you will have to go back to your room like a bold child and get it seriously at  a night  they cant check a computor in the restaurant or better still have on charge for breakfast and avoid these problems  god forbid someone should eat a hot breakfast when theyve only paid for a cold  I mean really  it lowers the tone of an otherwise great hotel  
P => Great hotellocation We have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the last several years  We have always found our stay to be enjoyable and restful  The business class rooms on the top  floors are very well appointed and clean  The large rooms with king sized bed AMAZING views of downtown and the huge shower make the room worth the cost  The breakfast buffet is quotfreequot with the business rooms and is of excellent quality and would meet most dietary needs  The staff is very helpful and friendly  We cant say enough about the location it is within easy walking or metro ride from everything  Some parts of the hotel are starting to look a bit dated but that doesnt take away from the overall quality  Parking is easy next door or you can also park under the university library  It isnt cheap but this is a major city where parking is a premium  We will be back many times  
P => Location  Price   Value Ive stayed here many times over the past ten years  Its always been a good deal for me    lots of Montreal is just a short walk away especially the Village  Its also right off two subway lines for easy access to the rest of the city  And while the hotel is fairly middle of the road in terms of quality Ive always been satisfied with the price  
P => Great Value underrated break breakfast I had been at the very pricey Hilton with internet at   a minute  moved out to the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis  Only mistake I booked online ot save  by prepayment and this cut me out of Club Gouverneur Privileges Card  The Business Center is accessible via  fee which is well worth it  The pool was lovely the staff lovely         Only minor issue water pressure was less than adequate in my room  Incredible breakfast simply incredible 
P => Great location value for money nice staf Only two issues  I booked online and made advance payment thus preventing me from accessing Hotel Gouverneur preferred guest services  I saved  online and lost out on everything else including the option of cancelling  Room was lovely and clean ac not as good as it could be and water pressure lacking  be  minutes to  fill the tub  A shower was not within the realm of the possible  It was nice and quiet compared to the Hilton the night before  Breakfast bufet was excellent and of incredible value  usienss center was great and private and empty   You are at the start of the gay ghetto which is starting to get tired  The average age seemed to be    apart from the hookers wo look sort of drug crazed  Nothing to do with the hotel certaily and it seemed to have excellent polite and cordial stafing  
P => Nice modern hotel in Le Village I stayed at the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis over the weekend of     The hotel is a modern high rise building located at the top of the main street that cuts through the gay village Ste  Catherine  The room I booked a standard double   was spacious clean and well appointed  The bathroom was small but adequate for my needs  Brand name toiletries were provided and plenty of towels  The condition of the furnishings in the room were very good and the large window overlooking the city was nice  I did not make use of the restaurants in the hotel but I was impressed with the warmth and friendliness of the reception staff  Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Gouverneur and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for nice accommodations in Le Village  
P => Very well located very convenient We had a wonderful stay in this hotel  Rooms are very big and the view on the city is amazing  Our room was overlooking a very nice garden where on sunday we could see people playing geant chess  Room have all amenities we needed and bathroom is ok too even a bit small  Staff is charming room where very clean and service laundry is very efficient  This hotel is very well located in front of one of Montreal university and the subway  We loved to walk from there to the city center only a  minutes walk We are traveling a lot with my wife and this was for us a very convenient place for a cold winter vacation in a wonderful Montreal and Quebec  
P => It was good until we found ourselves unable retrieve something left behind My dhter stayed over your hotel the last two nights and when she arrived home she realized she left behind her flat iron for her hair  Her name is Olivia Mahoney and she stayed in room   I placed a call last night and spoke wsecurity and they were unable to locate it through lost amp found  I was told to call back in the morning and I just got off the phone wsecurity and was informed I was out of luck since it wasnt turned in  I believe the person who cleaned the room should be held accountable and we shouldnt be brushed us off The second part of this trip involves the travel agent this agent took a group of twenty high school kids for a ten dollar security deposit for the hotel room and then boarded the bus Friday morning upon their departure demanding another five dollars for the security deposor they wouldnt be leaving and now its a total of fifteen dollars each person paid for a security deposit  When the group arrived at the hotel they were charged another twenty dollars each and the hotel informed them that the travel agent shouldnt have charged them its the policy of the Hotel to do so  These kids were a bit skeptical of this travel agent so they called the hotel and confirmed they do indeed do business with this agency  They didnt think to inquire about the security deposit and Im wondering why such a repitable hotel would do business with an agency that operates in such a manner  I would like to see how the hotel handles these issues  
P => Black  Used this hotel when visiting Montreal for the Black amp Blue weekend  Hotel is clean and well located for all the activities of the weekend plus only a short walk into the old city  Rooms are basic and large and well serviced  Staff courteous amp friendly  We used the restaurant for breakfast which had a good selection and reasonably priced  Hotel is not considered a luxury hotel however well located and clean and meets all the needs for weekend plus well priced  
P => Pleasant and convenient We stayed here during the annual strike season of hotel staff and the hotel seemed pretty unaffected by it all except for the somewhat casual dress of the employees trainers and t shirts Our room was large and comrfortable with excellent freebies   I liked the mouthwash  Slghtly old fashioned but it was fine  Breakfast served by suprerfriendly staff was an excellent hot buffet  The hotel is pretty convenient for the old town IF you know where you are going  Turn left and then next right if you want to catch the metro   or walk into town to the Vieux Port  Its about a  min walk  If you turn left and left into Catherine Street you hit the Village   the gay centre   which is fun but can be rather seedy  
P => Great staff great location I stayed four nights here at a special rate first two nights regular rate third night   off fourth night free  This even included a wonderful breakfast buffet on the first three mornings Pluses  Staff wonderful friendly efficient  Food hearty breakfast loved the pastries and fruits   Location conveniently located at the Berri UQAM metro station  Airport bus stops one block from the hotel runs every  minsMinuses  The rooms are clean but the hotel is starting to show its age  Rue Ste Catherine Est is a bit seedy during the day but the gay village livens things up on weekend nights Tips   or  day metro pass  It takes you to all the major attractions and shopping areas   Internet access  The hotel has wifi or you can purchase  hour access to their business center  There are internet cafes along Rue Ste Catherine  Also theres an Apple store in the shopping district on rue Ste Catherine Ouest   Dining  Lots of choices in the area  I ate at Echalote which offers Thai and Szechuan dishes  Theres an indoor food court between the hotel and metro station  At Place dArmes youll be near Chinatown and also fine restaurants around Notre Dame  I has a great meal at Bonaparte on rue St Francois Xavier  Their lunch menu ranges from    Shopping  From Notre Dame its a pleasant walk down rue St Urbain past Chinatown then left on rue Ste Catherine Ouest  Youll come across La Baie The Bay and Simons which has its own line of clothing at good prices  Museums  I learned a lot about the history of Canada and Montreal at the McCord Museum and Pointe a Calliere which is built on top of an excavation site   Discount tickets to Parc Olympique Biodome and Botanical Gardens are available at the hotel front desk   Day trip to Quebec City  You can book it at the hotel  Its well worth it  The Frontenac is awesome   Many public signs including the metro are in French only  So it  pay to know openclosed ouvertferme eastwest estouest and exit sortie  I found people in Montreal to be warm friendly and very proud of their French roots  You will often be greeted with quotbonjourquot or quotbonsoir quot Montreal is a lovely city rich in culture and history  
P => good value I wanted to stay at the Queen Elizabeth which had impressed me on my last trip to Montreal but since the staff was still on strike I had to look elsewhere  The conference proposed a choice between the Hyatt and the Gouverneur and the Hyatts pool being closed for reation we opted for the Gouverneur Some reviewers complain that the hotel is in a somewhat shabby part of town  I must say that the area is totally safe and found the latin Quarter with its student atmosphere and bars and restaurants a welcome change from the more sterile business district  The hotel itself provides good value for the money the rooms are large and well appointed the bathroom facilities well maintained and I liked the view although I would have preferred a room with an even room number to have the city view  The pool area is excellent with a gorgeous view in the queen elizabeth the pool is downstairs on the parking garage level and I found the bar cozy  I very much appreciated the no fuzz internet access  Ill definitely consider the Gouverneur on my next trip to Montreal  
P => Loved this hotel I was just in Montreal the past weekend and stayed at the Gov  Place Dupuis  I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel  The price was excellent the rooms were well appointed the staff was helpful and friendly the entire step of the way  If you are looking for a great hotel that centrally located you even have Metro access from the hotel building itself then stay here My friend and I even got  off the Sunday brunch for being guests at the hotel  Great buffet and service  I will definitely stay here again in Montreal  
P => Worth a try This hotel is definetely worth a try  Less known brand but compares to all the chains  The price is really good too and the free wifi is really a plus on the hotel website of guverneur you can also add on extras  nothing beats chocolate covered strawberries brought up to your room with a wine and cheese platter 
P => Great hotel My wife and I recently stayed at the Gouverneur Place Dupuis in Montreal to celebrate our anniversary  The location is pretty good they have a nice indoor parking in downtown montreal  We liked the fact that the metro is under the hotel montreals metro is very ghetto though  This is a wonderful hotel  The rooms have been luxurious spacious and well kept both times I have come here   The breakfast buffet is great though if like any buffet the best stuff goes early dont come to the buffet in the last  minutes haha  We also got to order some chocolate strawberries when ordering on their website which is pretty nice for a romantic time We highly recommend this hotel  
P => Best business hotel in Montreal I came over here for the F weekend  This wasnt my first time at the Gouverneur at Place Dupuis everytime I come to Montreal I stay here  Simply put it is the best business hotel I have stayed at  The staff is trained to be quick and efficient there is a metro station under the hotel the biggest metro station in Montreal really the center of all public transport to go anywhere you want  For the F I would simply leave my room walk down and in less than  minutes would be at the track  without once going outside or taking a cab The meals are good the bar is great and the rooms are fantastic  Compares to the Sweet Sleeping rooms at Sheraton or Hilton  Be sure to take the business class room it is only a slight extra  I think but it is really worth it The location of the hotel is really worth it i will be back for the international jazz festival and it is literally  feet from the hotel  
P => Great Location Fantastic Price I stayed at the Gouverneur a few weeks back and as always was impressed at the quality you get for what you pay  I paid roughly in the  area and received an overall experience that beats the nearby Hyatt Regency my old montreal favorite  Better quality at the Gouverneur and better service  Also the price is MUCH lower than the Hyatt usually   level The location is amazing youre downtown and you can get a cab to go anywhere without any wait whatsoever Also the rooms were very very clean which makes me want to come back Breakfast is good coffee great 
P => Fantastic Stay I always have a wonderful stay the Gouverneur  Everyone is so nice and the hotel is very clean  Good management and very helpful employees make each stay memorable  Also the rates are amazing for what you get high quality  star hotel priced like a comfort inn in the US Be sure to pay the extra US to get the superior room its worth it  
P => Very good for the price Ive stayed at this hotel several times and I highly recommend it  I paid about night back in  and its worth every penny  The rooms are clean large and quiet  HOWEVER if you get a smoking room I would like to warn you that you might have problems  I smoke and the smoking rooms absolutely reek of old ashtray aroma almost as if they dont clean it after the last guest though I doubt that is true  It is like a punishment for being a smoker  So I advise you to get a non smoking room and take it outside when you want one  You didnt go to Montreal to hang out in a hotel room anyway rightThe location is perfect  Again it is ideal for gay men the village is a short walk  Shopping and restaurants are convenient too  You can pop onto the metro right at BerriUQAM its only a short walk away Lastly the staff is pleasant and polite  Skip the restaurant in the hotel itself  They give you a certificate for continental breakfast  You should have un petit dejeuner at one of the many awesome establishments Cora Le Jardin the city has to offer  
P => Bad time Come back and see it now  I know cities and I know hotels  Some are boring and quiet Montreal is not especially downtown  The Governuer is especially close to the gay village metro shopping restaurants and aside from the street people who are somehow tolerated along Ste  Catherine East it seems the hotel showed no problems  None of the many guests I spoke to had any problem with room or staff  There are other places to stay if you want to be away from seeing the gay clubs but realize that gay people are not into having things quotperfectquot all around them and readily accept people whether rich or desperately poor  Police patrol constantly discreetly  Come back and try it again if you dont have unreasonable expectactions for the neighborhood around a big city downtown hotel  
P => Great Hotel and Good Location This is a great clean basic hotel in a good location  After having to check out of Sheraton Le Centre we found this hotel closer to the area we wanted to be in  The woman at the front desk check in process could not have been more helpful and friendly  We got an executive room on the top floor for less than our booking at the sheraton  The room was nicely orated fairly large clean and quiet  The bed was very comfortable with great pillows  The views of montreal were spectacular from our room  The hotel is very close to the subway station shopping and the gay village  We would definitely stay here again when visiting Montreal  
P => A Neighborhood on the Edge The Hotel Gouverneur Place Dupuis is in a neighborhood that very much resembles Eighth Avenue in New Yorks Theater District   yes there are pan handlers and peep shows nearby but so are the restaurants and attractions of the Latin Quarter  As far as Im concerned the neighborhood is great  Its convenient to lots of summer activities shopping and the arts center and the police presence is strong and makes me feel quite safe  The ethnic diversity is a real plus  In summer the park across the street is the site for festivals notably the Nuits dAfrique music festival in the month of y  Two blocks away is the Juste pour Rire Comedy festival with its carnival atmosphere during the month of y Ive stayed at this hotel before and find the staff helpful and pleasant  The lobby is large and well appointed the elevators are fast and the breakfast dining room and bar are good Rooms are large and well furnished with large windows overlooking either the St  Lawrence or the large park across the street  Everything is in working order and the amenities and comforts are fine  Beds are particularly comfortable  Water pressure and hot water are good Id recommend this hotel to anybody  Youll interact with the city in a far better way at the Gouverneur than at a fancier hotel in a more sterile neighborhood  
P => Wonderful hotel   Creepy neighborhood My friend and I had a girls day out here over the weekend and we were delighted with our room the breakfast and the location   somewhat It is right across the street from the Metro which is wonderful but when we went out at night to get dinner there were police all over and someone stretched out on the curb where we had to cross the street Not the most impressive initial impressionIt is an easy   min walk to Old Montreals northern edge  The breakfast buffet was great although there was a big line and when we got inside there were lots of empty tables   I dont know if they just didnt have enough servers on dutyI made my reservation via Expedia and I am sure that I specified a nonsmoking room however when we checked in they said that all they had were smoking rooms and asked if I would like to upgrade to a business room for USD more so I did The hotel is great once you are inside although on the street outside there were all kinds of characters hanging aroung  The room was beautiful with lots of ammenities and a great view from which we were told we could see the fireworks   we could see the smoke and hear them but there was a huge office building blocking the view Indoor parking is discounted for guests with in and out priviliges although you have to walk up and down the ramp to get to your car All in all I might stay here again but for the price USD including parking amp breakfast I think I could have done better elsewhere  
P => Dicey Location We were satisfied with the hotel itself   helpful staff generous spotless room with great view of Mont Royal ent restaurant and convenient parking garage but this is not one of a Montreals charming neighborhoods Rue St  Catherine is a sea of strip shows and fast food joints and panhandlers block the street day and night  Its also a long walk to see the historic sights of Old Montreal  
P => Would stay here again  I stayed here as part of a group for OutGames   It was a perfect location for the venues on St  Catherine Street  The hotel was very clean the rooms were big and the staff were very very helpful considering the large number of non french speaking aussies who were staying there  I would definitely recommend Hotel Place Dupuis as a place for future visits to Montreal  The breakfast was cheap for buffet only about   The room we had was quiet overlooking the park and high enough to not hear any street noise  The fact that the subway station was so close was great and also the shopping mall with fresh fruits and other snacks was just down stairs also  Only point that i disliked was that unless you upgraded to quotdeluxequot there was no fridge in the standard rooms  The ice machine was also on the floor above so it was a bit hard to keep drink cold  
P => Outstanding Time in Montreal We have always been satisfied with our stays at the Place Dupuis hotel  Over the years we have come here often and the friendly staff make an effort to make us feel right at home  The room  is now considered our room whenever we go to Place Dupuis it is simply fantastic with a great view and the business class luxury  Special thanks to Miss Bujold Nicole and the rest of the great staff  
P => Outstanding for our groups lengthy stay The Gouverneur Place Dupuis was as near perfect as I can imagine for our groups  day stay for a residential course in ruary   There were about  of us in residence there in some of the coldest weather many of us had ever experiencedThe bedrooms were terrific great views updated furnishings nice bathrooms  Room service was wonderful    prompt smiling delivery people  Housekeeping did a wonderful job and responded quickly to requestsneeds  A number of us doubled up there was plenty of space for this  Kids in room would work fine in the larger rooms The restaurant and bar were wonderful    way above the usual hotel fare  Food was plentiful varied and well prepared  We enjoyed the French influenced daily specials as well as standards    and in a stay as long as ours with little time outside the hotel for lunches people were delighted with the restaurants service and meals  Not one complaint even from vegetarians  The dining room has corners and nooks where families and friends can get together   plenty of food that kids would love  The bartenders and waitpersons came to know us and greeted us like old friends  Same with the front desk and the concierges who were very cheery and helpful and could even print out information on directions amp destinations at the desk  The hotel is perched atop a Montreal Underground shopping center and you can quickly walk to the Berri Metro stop which happens to be a key transfer point for three subway lines  Thus getting to any part of Montreal is very simple  What a locationWe used meeting facilities    the Quebec Room in particular  Everything was perfectly set up by the staff and those in charge of our account  We were very pleased by the hotels flexibility and responsiveness I used the Business Center nearly every day  For an extra  Canadian you can buy an access card to check your email print out a document relax in front of a plasma TV etc  Its not a giant center but very nicely set up  A number of folks in our group used the th floor swimming pool and the small but very pleasant fitness center  These guests were quite happy with what was available I would recommend this hotel to business travelers families couples    it really was one of the nicest hotel stays I can remember 
P => Excellent FrenchEnglish experience   great valuefriendly staff    I stayed at the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis for over a week and felt like many of the staff were long lost friends by the end of my stay  Friendly great value with an excellent location sums up this hotel The staff was friendly and patient when I bravely tested out speaking French  What a great experience being sorrounded by bilingual hotel employees  The food was wonderful especially the buffet with French stand bys such as main dishes pastas yummy salads bread fresh fruit cheese pate and tarts to name a few  The bell desk staff was super too making reservations for a number of great restuarants in the area  I am from the USA east coaster and recommend this hotel over any other chain hotel for a great quotFranchophonequot experience  I will definitely stay there again during my next visit to Quebec  
P => Great location at the edge of the gay village My partner and I stay at the Hotel des Gouverneurs Place Dupuis pretty much every time we go to Montreal for the weekend largely because of its favourable location within walking distance of the gay venues that line St  Catherine St  The experience has proven to be a reliable one  service is efficient and entirely satisfactory and the rooms are satisfactory  Some seem to have been redone and are a bit nicer  the older ones are tired by servicable  I echo the comments on the underground parking which is very cramped by N American standards  The only cautionary note is that there seem to be a lot of college aged kids there from the US on the weekends  I have never had any bad experiences with noise though I could see that happening if you got the wrong next door neighbour  
P => Excellent hotel clean upscale safe  This hotel is located a little west of the downtown core but it is well worth the stay Affordably priced and above average service   I think this hotel operates just like a HILTON FAMILY brand  They are friendly all the time very polite and will be helpfull during your stay  Right accross the street from next to the Berri Uqam subway station also helps there is food restuarants and grocery within walking distance  
P => Loved it but upgrade to Business Class Ive stayed to this hotel a few times over the past couple of years as Montreal is a quick weekend get away  I have always enjoyed my stays and never had a problem  I cant stress enough the difference between standard rooms and business class rooms  I always stay in business class rooms but recently I arrived in the wee hours of the morning and they put me into a standard room until my business class room could be made ready  OH MY It was okay but I dont believe I would be comfortable for a long stay  It was of the standard riott variety with bedspread carpeting and drapes that I agree with past posters could use an updating The business class rooms are well orated with red silk covers on the beds thick mattresses and the showers have full body heads that wash you head to toe  The bath is ble and the floors are hardwood with beautiful rugs and comfortable furniture  Another benefit is the concierge lounge and free breakfast  I like the location as it is near the clubs in the gay village so it is easy to drink and stumble home  Ive never seen anyone in the lobby that didnt belong there or though like any big city watch yourselves and keep you guard about you  The park accross the street is known hangout for drug dealers but you get that in central park accross from the Ritz Carlton so enjoy but be safe  
P => Good location dated rooms Well Ive stayed at the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis about  or  times over the past  years  Ive also tried various other hotels in Montreal over the years This is a large hotel and the location is ideal for some people    right on the edge of the Gay Village convenient to the Metro and within a long walk of Downtown Montreal  St  Catherine s Street in this area has an impressive array of restaurants clubs bars shops  Rue St  Denis amp Rue St  Laurent with dozens and dozens of wonderful restaurants are close by  So in my mind the Gouverneur Hotel Place Dupuis has a very desireable location Keeping this in mind I do think that the hotel has been  cruising  on its location  Over the years I think that the quality of the rooms has not kept pace  The rooms are now quite dated and the entire hotel could use a complete reation  The shower really needs to be upgraded  Everything still works but the rooms seem to be from the s not from  To compete with more modern hotels this hotel should consider a major upgrade  If the hotel is not upgraded some better amenities should be offered such as free breakfasts we were offered  breakfast coupons which doesn t cover the entire cost of breakfast so we didn t use them free Internet access or free parking The front desk staff was polite enough  The hotel garage is not at all user friendly and Id be concerned if I were to try to drive a SUV or a car with an antenna  In any event this hotel will probably continue to be very popular among select visitors mainly because of its location but next time I think Ill stay somewhere else  
P => The WORST hotel Ive ever stayed at Avoid it at all costs This is by far the WORST hotel Ive ever stayed at I wouldnt recommend it to anyone It was rated as a  star hotel on the website that I booked it through Hotels com but it should have been more like  starMy whole family went to Montreal for my parents th Anniversary celebration which SHOULD have been a pleasurable experience  We all stayed at the Gouverneur Place Dupuis and it turned out to be a nighte It was not in the best neighborhood  The fire alarms kept going off sometimes in the wee hours of the night while we were sleeping homeless people and drug addicts freely walked into the hotel to accost the guests and beg for money the toilets sinks and tubs all backed up in every single one of our rooms we didnt always get the complimentary soaps and shampoos everyday and the staff werent exactly the most friendly When we complained about all the problems the front desk didnt accomodate us in any way    in fact the manager we spoke with was quite rude They basically didnt want to hear about any of our inconveniences Customer service is dead at this hotel Youre definitely on own here The parking garage is a joke too    the ceilings are so low  If you stay here youd better have a strong antenna on your vehicle  You have to crouch over to get out of your car and the spaces are so tight Also dont expect to find a spot in the garge if you spend a day out on the town and come back after  Nor are the valets there when theyre supposed to be there  hours a dayFinally I had booked all the rooms under my AAA membership to get a discount  I received an e mailed confirmation of all the rooms and the discounts wed all be getting which I even printed the confirmation and showed the front desk upon check in but they told us that the hotel would only honor the AAA discount for me since I booked the rooms    the others in my family all had to pay full price Sounds awfully suspicious Avoid this hotel at all costs I cant think of anything nice to say about it  Its worth it to pay a little extra and stay at a much nicer place 
P => Great Gouverneur We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Montreal and a great stay at the Gouverneur Place Dupuis  The rooms have been recently reated and offer beautiful views of Montreal  The staff was courteous and the bellman  concierge was great at recommending restaurants and providing sightseeing information  
P => It seems that some reviewers here stayed at a different Gouverneur hotel HiFirst of all let me tell you that the people in the four previous reviews either have extremely high standards and were expecting the Four Seasons for  a night or its something else  I have stayed four times so far since last summer the last time being  weeks ago and I have a VERY hard time believing these people stories minus be the fire department  Yes some of the lobbys fixtures might not be the most up to date but again youre paying a rate of  MAXIMUM on weekdays for a still pretty central hotel  Besides the furniture carpets wallpapers and lighting fixtures are all updated the elevators are fast and the pool is clean so whats the big deal Gouverneur doesnt pretend to be a luxury Westin or Omni hotel  I never thought Id find myself here defending a hotel but after reading the latest reviews I felt compelled to write based on FOUR good and consistent stays over a little less than a year and more If you include those of    So at the end of  a group of friends ided to go and celebrate my birthday in Montreal  We booked two rooms at the same time standard rooms for the Saturday night and we planned on going out  To make it convenient I asked If it would be possible to get adjacent or communicating rooms  The lady at reservation said she would try her best and put up a request with the reservation  We arrived on the Saturday a little before  p m even though check in time is not before  and check out is actually late  p m at the Gouverneur  To my surprise they had our  rooms ready on the same floor and actually adjacent The check in staff was pleasant and the whole process was quick  Our standard non smoking rooms on the th floor were clean and as advertised just partly reated  Obvious with the new carpet smell and the actual brand new look of the carpet  Drapes bedding and all lighting fixtures all brand new  Mattress was super comfortable it actually reminded me of the Hyatt Grand bed    so being curious I lifted the blanket a bit and it is the exact same Sealy pillowtop that the Hyatt Regency Montreal has that I love  I slept very well  The bathrooms have not been reated yet but were very clean If a little outdated  No trace of mould in our bathroom  No plumbing problems in either room or in any room I had in fact at this hotel so far be I have been lucky  We had all the necessary toiletries soaps shampoos lotion shower cap and even mouthwash a toothbrush a sewing kit and a shoe sponge in a standard room The usual three clean large towels provided and I made a mess not realizing part of the shower curtain wasnt completely tucked in the tub  When I called for towels three more were brought up even though I had asked for one within  minutes  Powerful shower  Basically I really have nothing to say for the price paid  We went to swim before dinner and the lifeguard was very pleasant  The change rooms are clean but outdated  Breakfast I did not feel rushed by the staff  Our waitress was pleasant and fast in her service  The buffet was good and filled with every possible choice as usual  She did not rush us out like mentionned previously and to be quite honest I have never skipped that buffet for three reasons the food is always good the service is equally up to par and for a downtown Montreal hotel at  the price is more than reasonable for a buffet  To sumize it this was another good stay at the Gouverneur  Rooms are always clean and Ive never had any sort of plumbing or coffeetoiletries supply problems  Staff is pleasant particularly Judith at the reception and the young Concierge cant remember his name  When in the lobby he overheard me trying to explain to my friends on how to get out back on the  and he offered a map and to take over so I could get out of the hotel  I thought this was very nice of him  They have never refused to honour the different rates I have booked and I have trouble believing that they would let punks and beggars in  How is that possible when there is a visible security guy in the lobby both during the day and at night I can certify that I have never seen people from the park in front of the hotel come and trouble guests inside the lobby and even at the doors  I am sure with the firm alarm some kind of compensation was offered or given  I am sure they could have done something given I always have been replied to when giving comments on their comment card  They seem to value their guests feedback  The parking garage Well seriously the ceiling is low thats true But the Place Dupuis mall and office complex was built in the s  What do you want the hotel to do about that Dynamite the building so they can increase the ceiling by  feet Youre never more than  seconds no exaggeration to the elevator  Im  and I dont have to bend to walk  And finally YES the hotel is in the GAY village  It is a member of the IGLTA and its even on their website  So expect to see homos  Unfortunately yes you see homeless people in the park up front but you also have a beautiful view of the downtown Montreal skyline  Its not a dump nor a depressing hotel but dont expect the W This is a local Four Points Courtyard or Holiday Inn Select style hotel 
P => Overpriced But Reated Hotel Four of us from Ottawa stayed at this overpriced hotel for one night in  different rooms  The main problem was getting there due to street clousures for the Jazz festival stages blocking various key intersections it took forever once we entered downtown Montreal The rooms were mouldy smelling but not bad overall  The bed was comfortable the bathrooms clean with mouthwash toothbrush shampoos etc The buffet breakast was adequate though the coffee was gross  They had young students serving breakfast  The pancakes are crepes NOT pancakes as one expected  The food was warm but plentlyful  The breakfast is included in some pacakges  If you call the Montreal Tourism Authority and ask for the quotCasino Packagequot you will receive  in chips for the Montreal Casino with the room booking  I won  at the casino  This was the good part The room price is outragous at over  per night Look somewhere else  Its located in the gay village area so dont be shocked to see men kissing and holding hands on the streets  I am very open minded so it dindt bother me but it  bother your kids We didnt have time to use the pool  The one idea I did like was the shopping mall on the main level  This was handy for beer drinks muffins etc  There is a Dunkin Donuts there as well  MacDonalds is right accross the street on St Catherine Too me it seemed like they reated the hotel recently so it looked a little better than some reveiews that I have read  Dont Forget your Aeroplan card my stupid travel agent didnt bother telling me they except it and I didnt bring it too late now 
P => Drop the      Stars Curtrude staff smells problems etc  This was a very disappointing experience for my whole family  We grouped for an anniversary trip my parents th and booked a total of  rooms  All  had problems  had overflowing toilets  had problems receiving necessary items such as tissuesor toilet paper   do we bring our own Breakfast was great with vouchers make sureyou get them or you pay  Our group consisted of my parentsseniors my familyadultsteens and my brothers with their toddler children  On a nightly basis the fire alarm goesoff and it seems to be handled like its no big deal as customers are pouring down firestairwell at  in the morning in fear of their life waking to this and finding elevatorsare in lockdown because of the alarms  We were put through this for three nights  Thinkingit was a glitch in the system or one of the druggies from the square coming in and setting off the alarms  The homelessness and dereliction in the park is the view from any windowin front  My disappointment continued as beggars enter belching and begging moneywhen you leave the mezzanine level to exit the lobby The parking garage bend over tocarry luggage as you exit  Minivans and suvs need different levels to park  Some personelfrom front desk and some waitresss very curt  I dont expect to be hounded while eatingmy breakfast and a bill is placed in front of me asking  times if I am ready or do I need a pen or something  No I was still having a croissant amp my coffee Wish I read this website first My parents th anniversary was memorable for different reasons now  
P => Very adequate hotel in great location  The Gouverneur Place is a great hotel for a first time visitor to Montreal  It is situated right on the Place Dupuis Metro station Berri UQAM which is quite central to anywhere youd want to go downtown  You could easily walk to many places as well   we often walked back to the hotel after wandering on Sainte Catherine  The staff is quite friendly especially to my  year old son  The buffet had nice fresh fruits and ent selection of food  The rooms were clean and our view of Mont Royal and downtown from the th floor was gorgeous   imagine the top floor The bed was comfortable carpet looked new the design is updated and more modern than the usual floral bedspread you get at many hotels  ughh The elevators are fast  Parking is  per day I believe not horrendous  I recommend this hotel to those who are looking for an above average hotel for a good price in a good location  
P => Great view at night   not so good in the morning I stayed here with my wife and two teenage chidren in y   On the whole we really liked the hotel itself but its not in exactly the classiest area in Montreal nor close to any of the main tourist areas  Ive been a backpacker myself in the past so Ive nothing against them in principle but at these prices you dont expect to see backpackers and I mean be  or so of them bedding down under the stars in the park across the street and performing their morning ablutions at the park fountainThe hotel rooms are excellent   ours had a stunning view especially at night across the Montreal skyline  It was spacious and very comfortably furnished  Breakfast buffet was good  despite our visit coinciding with the recent hotel staff strike but the Saturday night Mediterranean theme buffet was a big disappointment  The bar area is pleasant but very small for a hotel of this sizeParking was convenient if a little tricky in the underground car park beside the hotel Our stay was only two nights   if Id been in Montreal longer I might have sought out a hotel in a better location 
P => Good hotel unsalubrious neighbourhood This is an excellent hotel with a good reasonably priced restaurant  The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have come across  Unfortunately the neighbourhood in which the hotel is situated is not the best but there is direct access to the Metro system  
P => Still a good price and central location I just came back from Montreal and I was staying at the Gouverneur for the Easter weekend  The place hasnt changed much in the  since Ive been there and could use some still remodeling  Although I am told that they are in the process of remodeling my room wasnt  The staff are friendly and courteous at all times The locations is perfect as it is right besides one of the subway stops and actually within walking distance to the shopping areas  All in all still a nicely priced hotel compared to others in the Montreal area  
P => Perfectly fine hotel This hotel  not be the best in town but I think its great value  There are plenty of much more expensive hotels in Montreal but for what you get I think its great  I had no problems with the staff  In fact I found the restaurant staff in particular to be quite friendly  The room was immaculate and the view nd floor was great  I appreciated the high speed Internet access for my laptop  As other posters have mentioned you do have to remember that the hotel is on the edge of the gay village and is not really within comfortable walking distance from the major shopping district west end Ste Catherine Street  However the hotel has excellent access to the subway which can whisk you to the shopping area in about  minutes

P => interesting experience My sleeping experience was amazing the beds are incredibly comfortable  The hotel is very well located and as for everything else    you pay for what you get 
P => Exceed expectations we went for a week end on ust we were greeted nicely with a warm smile fast check in procedure rooms were amazing nice view and comfortable bedsfood was very good  rates were afordable  it was a nice experience i enjoyed my saty and their professional staff exceeded my expectaionsA B 
P => very enjoyable stay Just got back from a short trip to Montreal were we stayed at this hotel  The location was great close to major attractions the room was spacious and inviting and the staff was very friendly and helpful  On top of that the quality of the service made our stay very enjoyable  
P => great hotel    very comfy retreat I stayed at the Grand Plaza hotel last night and the manager was super nice Rooms very modern beds were comfyand the hotel extremely quiet    great place to come back to after a longnoisy day in old Montreal    excellent location     
P => Non Professional staff with little knowledge Just go back from staying at this horrific hotel if you can call it that  The place was disgusting the pool was smelly and gross and to top it off the the sheets were ripped and the staff had absolutely zero people skills  Would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone espcially those with children  Word of advise to the hotel try cleaning the outside windows once in awhile the crud that is building up on the edges are absolutely disgusting 
P => Grand   NO   Centre Ville   YES There is nothing quotGrandquot about this Grand Plaza Hotel  Dont let picture fool you be youre not fooled to begin with  The hotel as many reviews have mentioned has seen better days  The first room we stayed in the air conditioning didnt work property    so the room was hot and the ac made a tapping noise all night  We had to call to move rooms at am that first nightThe pool is gross  The clientele is definitely budget so keep that in mind if thats not your scene On the plus side the hotel is perfectly located to see all of the city    Rue St Denis is around the corner and we walked to all other areas    Musee Beaux Arts Gay Village steps to Mont Real Vieux Montreal  So if location is the name of your game definitely think about this as a selection  If you were expecting anything Grand in the Grand Plaza keep on searching  
P => Amazing value   great for travelers on a budget This hotel cost us  a night at least  less than other hotels in the area  We got a king size bed on the th floor with a huge and glorious view of the river For the money it is hard to do better  The rooms are clean if a little worn  The beds are very comfortable and the fitness room is very new  The bathrooms are a little spartan but quite clean Parking is expensive if u use theirs but parking around the block is free Overall as a cheap clean and comfortable home base in an extremely convient location i dont think u can beat this hotel  
P => Grand Plaza   minus the Grand While this hotel claims to be a  Star accomodation it has a few areas that make you questions the th Star    While the hotel room is really big and the bed comfortable supposedly a Queen most likely a Full and the location great next to St  Dennis and the Latin Quarter the lack and lackluster service coupled with the apparent air conditioning annd water pressure shortage thermostat reads    in reality more like  bring down the ambiance a few notches For the price we paid for our Business Suite  pre tax per night it could say that it is worth it   But charge me the regular price   NO WAYThey offer a breakfast buffet in the morning    reg  with AAA discount but honestly its worth skipping  The fruit is unripe the eggs soggy the sausage anemic and the tea pots old and mangled Bottom line if it is luxury you are looking for keep on looking  If a comfortable bed is enough and you can look around its flaws and get a great deal on the room   then its worth considering  
P => Adequate This hotel is very shabby but the location is fantastic  If you get a good rate on line its worth a stay  It has a ent little pool and exercise room  Ive never eaten in the restaurant   why would you when you are in Montreal a diners paradise Theres a great coffee shop two blocks away for breakfast  There is an entrance to the metro in the hotel or you can walk  or  blocks down the hill to the central metro station for the whole city  The staff are friendly  The hotel is convenient to tourist and cultural sites and is also close to downtown  It just desperately needs an update but if youre ok with tired or theres no reason not to stay here  And by the way the views are incredible  One downside I did have a lot of problems with the wifi     although it was free It dropped a lot  
P => Great Hotel and Location One of my favorite hotels   I have stayed there three times to catch the Just For Lhs comedy festival or just to experience Montreals cafes  The rooms are roomy clean and have excellent views of the downtown skyline  The service is very English friendly if you need it  It can sometimes take a while to check in if you come during the rush but they give you a free cookie nice touch  The location is very close to the center of the comedy festival and if you like walking you can get to several of the areas hotspots on St  Laurent and St  Denis  Its also just a few blocks to a Metro station  I try not to stay anywhere else now  
P => Be aware of billing practices in this hotel Recently stayed  night with the kids  The purpose of stay   my husbands th anniversary which has been spoiled later by the fact that we found  additional charges on Visa made by the hotel  After multiple attempts to contact the hotel billing department for an explanation weve been told that we smoked in the room and have been charged for thatWE ARE A FAMILY OF NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT SMOKE AT ALL As of today four weeks after our stay the management of the hotel is still inaccessible for answers  WILL DEFINITELY AVOID STAYING IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT IN FUTURE  
P => Definately past its prime but nowhere as bad as some reviews make it to be Ill try to keep this review pretty short as I agree with many points that have been made by previous reviewers on this site  Stayed for one night on Halloween this week end and it was as the rating suggest an average hotel and stay  I would definately not pay much more than I did but around the CAN  a night k the hotel is terrific value You wont find much better accomodation around that price range in Montreal  I also dont understand those who said it is not downtown Montreal the Doubletree definately IS downtown in the Latin district  The business district is a little further away but you are  minutes or less by foot from St Denis and St Laurent where youll find many restaurantsbars and Montreal architecture  The village is also  minutes away walking tops  There is a pharmacy right in front of the hotel and a grocery store about  minutes away again all by foot  Here are some points however on which I agree with previous reviews We also brought a labtop to take advantage of their free Wifi and it did keep cutting off or we had trouble connecting to the network  If youre just checking attractionsrestaurants it aint that bad for for a business traveler that would definately get annoying  At least they dont charge like most fully branded Hiltons   Rooms are definately a bit worn but only for some things  Its funny how they seemed to have put some effort in reating some things and others items were left untouched  For instance our carpet looked if not brand new very recently changed  The wallpaper had no trace of usepeeling either and the beds are the standard Doubletree fare with jumbo pillows and a very comfy mattress  Now there are a few things I did notice as I stayed numerous times here last time before this one in  with my parents back when I was still a teen in the late s when the hotel was still a Crowne Plaza  The furniture is still the same as what they had around   when I first stayed there as a kid  To give them credit though our furniture was in perfect condition if not a bit classic in style with no scratch ks or anything  Ive seen recently reated hotels with much more worn furniture  Theirs is hardwood though which is probably why it stays in such a great shape  The bathrooms were also left mostly in their original state with some minor improvements such as new lighting fixtures and a curved shower rod  Just dont expect a nice granite countertop and floors here  Again at around  downtown Montreal cant complain since it was clean  Be aware howerver that not all rooms are equal since I asked to see a new one after the one I was assigned was right next to the elevator landing even though my HHonors profile states I want to be away from elevators and it had certainly not had as much care as the first room they gave me   The pool area is grotty and was empty both times we checked it out  This area was what seemed like it needed the most attention here  A good scrub in the change rooms and around the floors edges definately required   Views from the rooms are absolutely beautiful no matter where your room is as the hotel is on top of a hill with few tall towers around  The hotel was busy on this Halloween night and so was their Valet  I dont like using Valet Parking so I ided to stick to self parking and not only do you have no in out privileges there is a   cash deposit required on arrival  They dont take credit cards  And they wont let you park within their view so you can go grab cash  Awful service from the parkings management and the hotel on that part who was of no help unless you used their valet Other observations Staff was not as cold as some made them to be but Ive definately had better service in Hilton family properties before  Female staff certainly more cheerful and willing to help I found than their male counterparts that were there on the night of arrival   Service calls were not promptly responded to  We had no wash clothes the first night and called the next morning to get some  It took two calls to housekeeping and nearly half an hour to get some  Went down to check out the restaurant to see If they had any food left just before lunch time and the employee there was too busy chatting on the phone to even acknowledge me even though I was literally standing in front of her  I left   Lobby is still the same as it was in the s minus a new floor but well preserved if you like traditional flair  Elevators are quick My conclusion Stay here especially in the low season when they have awesome rates and youll get a ent clean room a stunning safe location HHonors points if youre a member great views from the rooms and free Internet  My advice would be to just keep your expectations low and youll be more than happy with this Doubletree  
P => Comfortable stay Comfortable stay at this well located high rise on Sherbrooke  Had a great view of downtown from the th floor  However rooms and in particular bathrooms are in need of a makeover  
P => Faded beauty  Honest yet shows its age Booked this through Priceline for  all inclusive  As one of the previous reviewer mentioned as the Canadian dollar is going down it  be worthwhile to check the Hilton website directly which is in CA  We arrived late  When I called in the morning they told me only rooms with doubles where available however I was given a King upon request  Service was friendly  The hotel was very busy on this Halloween evening  The room itself was clean spacious with a very comfortable king bed and pillows which were not overtly soft  The bathroom is diminutive and the shower is anaemic at best and rather dirty due to the anti slip covering on the floor of the bath  Toiletries are adequate  The view from the room on the th was quite nice overseeing the Champlain bridge and the river  The exercise room is equipped with TV mounted aerobic machines  The pool is of ent size however the walls were peeling and moulding  The sauna is in each of the men and ladies room and barely worked in both I understand  Parking is expensive but you can park on St Hubert and streets further east or its  to  for h at the Biblioth que Nationale  Metro is very close Sherbrooke Station  Restaurant is expensive for breakfast so I recommend L vidence on St Denis and Cherrier   for  eggs  pancakes potatoes fruits and toasts with maple syrup Overall a ent hotel showing some signs of wear and in need of a good refurbishing  
P => Strongly Recommend Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for our two year anniversary for the weekend and booked a basic room through their website  It was   per night which wasnt to bad  Check in time is  but we arrived at  that morning  Upon our arrival  hours before check in time the receptionist told us that there was something wrong with our room that we reserved so they bumped us up to the quotLa Presidente Suitequot on the sixth floor    night value for NO extra charge  They were very welcoming and polite and I would STRONGLY RECCOMEND this hotel to anyone going to Montreal  Our Suite had a kitchen ceramic tile floors living room couch lay z boy tv and our rooms had a queen bed with a tv as well  The bathroom was geourgeous and had Neutrogena products which was also good  Overall the location was great and the friendly staff were amazing  The Metro station is not far at all once you walk out the main lobby turn left  It was a great anniversary and an excellent hotel to stay at  
P => Heart of Veggie Heaven We got a good deal on this hotel through Priceline BUT I would recommend checking the exchange rate and the rate the hotel itself is offering This is a solid three star hotel as advertised  Its nice and clean somewhat upscale and perfectly located for leisure travel  There are two Metro stops within easy walking distance and from there all the citys attractions are easily accessible For vegetarians the location of this place at the edge of the Latin Quarter is fantastic  The lower part of rue St  Denis is a very short walk from the hotel and it offers a variety of veg and veg friendly restaurants including the unbelievable Le Comensal The reception desk people were not friendly or helpful at all  Parking is   a day with NO in out privileges at a private garage behind the hotel  BUT the hotel people will dispense no information except that the garage exists I hasten to add that we were treated with the utmost courtesy everywhere else in Montreal  
P => Just okay  There is nothing spectacular for this hotel so the price is reasonable  Valet parking is expensive and if you park it yourself you are charged each time you take the car out and when we got our car out on the second there there was a non stop rattling scraping sound The receptionist who checked us in is possibly the gravest looking woman  Not a single smile passed her face and she was supposed to be welcoming us The maid on the other hand was very nice and efficient cleaning the bathroom without waking me up on my boyfriends request and stocking us up on chocolates The room is dilapidated with holes on the sheets and blanket and signs of breakage on the wall  Brown stuff either from the pool walls or from the sauna stuck on my boyfriends trunks  He also got a rash around his neck after that night of swimming there  I like the fact that there is a coffee maker but the coffee that they have is pretty disgusting  Lavazza should not taste like that  The internet connection is just awful  We have two laptops and on both we kept getting disconnected  The view is great but Im not sure if that makes up for everything else  
P => Very Good Stay Given all the bad reviews I was very apprehensive about staying here  But overall I definitely can recommend the hotel  Theres no doubt the hotel has seen better days  But if you can get beyond that it has several big advantages   Location The hotel is at the beginning of the Plateau area  What I liked about the location was that you were in much more of a neigborhood than downtown  Within a five minute walk you probably had two dozen restaurants nice apartment buildings shops convenient stores etc  You were right near the Metro  You are also a   minute walk from where the Aerobus airport shuttle departs from and probably about a  minute walk from the old city    Price When I booked the Doubletree was at least  or  a night cheaper than comparable hotels    Rooms Again the rooms are definitely a bit worn  But you had terrific beds free internet  free coffee and cookies and my room had an incredible view  
P => Dont judge a book by its cover    Admittedly the Doubletree Montreal is an aging hotel it used to be part of the Holiday Inn family but I think you will find this a most enjoyable and convenient place to stay First off it has a great location on Rue Sherbrooke Est just outside the hustle and bustle of the city center  Secondly it has a Metro stop right next to the hotel  Thirdly it has a parking garage connected to the hotel where I parked my car for the weekend at a very reasonable rate  Best of all there is a passageway right off the lobby that leads right into the garage  Best bet is to avoid the valet service and take your car directly to the garage  Just tell the garage staff you are staying at the hotel and they will advise you of the rate and where to park your car  As for the room it was very nice with a beautiful view of the city  Admittedly the rooms or and amenities were dated but the beds were new and most comfortable The breakfast buffet was excellent and the oversized towels guests find in the health clubpool were a nice touch Yes as I stated above the hotel is showing its age a bit but the quotlittle touchesquot they have added make this a place to which I will gladly return 
P => OK stay at the Doubletree My partner and I stayed at the Doubletree this past weekend for a extended weekend getaway in Montreal  We booked the room through Orbitz and got a good deal for the quality of the room and hotel  Pros Ask for a room on an upper level floor  We had a fantastic view of Downtown the St  Lawrence River and Mont Royal  We spent a tad bit more for the King bed room which was very spacious  The pool steam room and fitness area were well maintained  We loved the location unlike other reviews  We were actually glad we were not directly in downtown but in the charming Plateau neighborhood with plenty of great restaurants and boutiques a block away  The hotel is connected directly to a passage way to the Sherbrooke metro stop for easy transportation to Montreals tourist sites   And for those interested in checking out the Village its within an easy walking distance to Rue Ste  Catherine  min  along the very safe Rue Berri Cons The hi speed wi fi did not work during our entire stay despite many tries and calls to the front desk for help  Our bathroom was perhaps reated but was small and not well designed at all esp  the shower  The front desk staff ranged from friendly and helpful to apathetic  And despite the convenience dont order the room service breakfast   the eggs were powdered and runny awful and the espresso cold and weak  Much better breakfast can be found nearby  
P => Needs Updating Good location although recommend having a car for this area  Staff was polite and helpful valet was good little expensive  The rooms were dated and not as clean as other hotels but acceptable the washrooms were very tiny and need of a upgrading badly  Internet wi fi service was troublesome at times and not reliable  Received a deal on Priceline and would pay that price again but would not pay rack rate for this hotel  
P => Good hotel a bit out od downtown The Double tree has its plus and minus points  The plus points  Rooms are large and the property is pretty well maintained   The coffee maker in the room has Lavazza coffee and the amenities in the bathroom are Neutrogena  Both pretty nice and aplenty  The internet is free and printing available at the lobby is free tooThe minus points  The internet works extremely slow and is erratic and you wish you could pay for a faster connection   The Hotel is  stops from downtown Montreal McGill and Peel so you are a bit far away fromn the action   There is no fridge in the room or atleats was not in mineOverall a fair enough hotel that you can trade for one which is more centrally located  
P => Excellent This is a wonderful place  I got a king size room on a high floor with a spectacular view of the city for just  on a Saturday and couldnt be happier  Everything in the room was spotless looked and smelled new and fresh very similat to a riot  Bed was comfortable didnt see any stains anywhere carpet included  The room was behind the elevator and still couldnt hear ANY noise  The only thing that could be a setback was eventhough we put the heat to  it was kinda cold in the room but didnt have time to deal with it the soft and warm quilt took care of it   There was plenty of towels and soap in the bathroom and the coffe maker came with premium Lavazza cofeeLocation is also great on the major Sheerbroke ave just  min drive from Crescent street and Old Montreal  by taxi plus only one block from Saint Denis street with tens of bars and restaurants  Also plenty of free overnight parking around the hotel I realy cant imagine a better deal than this Dobletree in all of montreal where even the nastiest room in a shady area will cost you at least  bucks  This hotel will be my only choice if I want to visit Montreal again  
P => Great location  This hotel is in a great location directly above the metro station this helped when it was pouring rain  It is a few blocks from a street with many restaurants also convenient  It is a few blocks from downton and all the sites  The location itself is on the intersection of two busy streets so nothing romantic about that The room was perfeclty fine clean but again nothing so fantastic On a night of pouring rain we ate dinner at this hotels restaurant   I recommend you NOT do this unless it is pouring rain There are not many choices and what there is is not so delicious Now for the glitches    every night we stayed  nights our room key did not work  We had to go downstairs to the lobby to get it re activated every single day  Staff acted like this is a very common problem  Also it was valet only parking and on the last day valet took  minutes to get our car out of the garage   and there were not many people waiting either Finally they didnt give us a cookie like most doubletrees although later we saw others getting cookies  The latter is not really a gripe just an observation  Key thing was quite annoying though  
P => Excellent Stay We stayed at this hotel for literally  hours as we were passing through Montreal  My fiance and I lived in Montreal for about  years so we knew the location was great and considering the good price it just couldnt be beat  We arrived late after driving and were greeted with great and fast service  The valet parking was full but they offered a great alternative The room was HUGE and we had a view of downtownold port  It was very comfortable and the to go coffee cups that you could brew yourself in the morning were a nice touch  The bathroom was just so so  In that regard you are definitely not staying in luxury accommodations  We didnt order room service but the menu actually looked really good and varied so I wish we had tried it All in all a great hotel given the location and price  Im not sure the value can be beat in that area  
P => Great rooms great location great vacation This hotel should be rated much higher on tripadvisor  This hotel was very comfortable  Beautiful lobby nice hallways large guest rooms with amazing bedding and sheets  The bathroom was just average as were the elevators and the elevator banks  The front dest staff were both friendly and helpful and had a pleasant demeanor  The location of this hotel was key Centrally located right across the street from the subwaymetro stop and easy as pie to find your way around the city  We walked almost everywhere from the hotel  Near great restaurants and clubs as well as tourist sights too  Would definitely come back to this hotel  Great value overall great stay  Recommended by me 
P => Excellent location We had to be as close as possible to the Cegep du Vieux Montreal venue so we chose the Doubletree Plaza Hotel  We were not sure we chose a good location nor good hotel after reading the various mixed reviews here but at least for us in the end this hotel was outstanding for both location and comfort  And since we had to be here for ten nights we had to find something reasonably priced  Staying in Vieux Montreal would cost a fortune and frankly it was too far to walk to and from the Cegep as we had time constraints  And we did not want to rely on public transportation constantly  I suppose it depends on ones personal feelings but the Chateau L Argoat hotel is directly across the street from the Doubletree  Its true the Chateau L Argoat is something like what one would find in Paris for example as its a converted home thats now a sort of B amp B  Our rate at the Doubletree actually was a bit less than the Chateaus and we got more amenities at the Doubletree As to the hotel iself the hotel room had a bland basic chain hotel look the bathroom needs to be remodeled  The front desk staff ran from cold and unhelpful some day staff to very friendly and accomodating evening staff  The concierge staff were all helpful however  The restaurant staff are not so good  One morning youd get muffin with jam and butter served on the side French toast served with maple syrup on the side and other mornings you had to ask for them  Location wise we were very happy with the hotel  It is located on the border of the Plateau Mont Royal and Quartier Latin districts  That means you have a ton of choices for restaurants cafes and bars  We loved that we could walk a few minutes and cross the Square St  Louis and onto rue Prince Arthur with its myriad of restaurants offering outdoor seating since its summertime  Nighttime is the best with the locals and tourists out late at night eating and drinking at the outdoor tables just like they do in France  If you want to walk to Vieux Montreal it is very possible  We took about half an hour in the rain and all  And if you want to do shopping on the rue Ste  Catherine that is very possible to walk to as well  So in addition to the nice location the atmosphere couldnt have been any better In the end I really do not agree that the Doubletree is in a bad area at all as some reviews have said  
P => Comfortable room great location  I liked staying at this hotel  Of course I have to admit I booked it through priceline without knowing what I was getting and got a really good deal It is a typical high rise chain hotel  It is located at the edge of Plateau and Quartier Latin neighborhoods right next to a subway station  Since its in a nice residential neighborhood there are many good restaurants and stores around  It looked like the hotel catered largely to airline crews and people coming to conferencesexhibitions  I havent tried the ovepriced restaurant  There is a gym and a small indoor pool My room was very spacious and had a nice view  There was a large desk and there was free Wi Fi in the room  The only major annoyance   it was impossible to turn off the AC  It kept blowing cold air with a loud hissing noise  The thermostat controlled only a heater by the window  I had to stick a towel in the AC vent to be able to sleep  Also even though the bathroom looked recently remodeled it was done without much care for quality But overall it was the most comfortable stay I had in a long time  
P => Not so bad      Not so great      This hotel is located in the Latin Quarter of Montreal  Not quite downtown in the business district but definitely close to the great pubs and restaurants of Rue St  Denis and right next door to the Sherbrooke Metro station which provides quick access to most places you want to be at in downtown Montreal  Got this hotel at an excellent price on Priceline  Star Category  Check In was pleasant and efficient  Front desk staff were always willing to help and provide directions  No problems at all  Parking is a bit of a rip off at   a day with in and out privileges  I parked for free on the street at night although you have to be careful where to park   its tricky Tip   For free parking at night go  yards east to St  Hubert  On the west side of St  Hubert close to Sherbrooke there is space for about  cars between the last driveway on St  Hubert and Sherbrooke Street  There are other places too however those spots were closest to the hotel and always available at night  The lobby is newly reated and looks good although many other areas of the hotel are still tired and worn  The elevators are dreary looking and sounding  Only the very top floors have reated rooms  Do all you can to get one however unless youre paying full rate youll most likely get an unreated room  The carpet is very dull looking and the room although comfortable and very clean has seen better days  The bathroom is horrible  Very very small and no towel rack which I found bizarre  All towels are placed in a rack inside the bathtub  There is no counter space at all so if youre more than one person it will be very cramped in the bathroom  There is free wireless interent however I noticed that availability was only intermittent and not reliable  This hotel will improve once the rooms are reated but for now this is a budget hotel that should only be considered at a very deep discounted price  
P => Average stay I stayed at this hotel a couple of nights ago  I got it for  plus taxes on Priceline star category  First of all not many locals know about this hotel  It is also a bit out of the way from the financial district amp university area where high end hotels are located  Having said that I walked very slowly to Old Montreal in  minutes  It also took me  minutes to Holt Renfrew in high heels  Montreal is pedestrian friendly so if you like to walk then the location is not bad  Metro station is also  minutes away  I was able to check in at  pm  I had called the night before to confirm a non smoking room but forgot to ask for a queen bed  I got a double bed room   It had wall to wall large window facing west  The room was huge and nicely furnished  White crisp linens lots of pillows comfortable bed  The bathroom was a disappointment  It looked outdated and tacky shower curtains didnt help  Still the bathroom was largelarger than Fairmont Queen Elizabeth bathrooms and there were thick fluffy white towels and Neutrogena toilettries  I however didnt have a good nights rest  First of all I was having a mild skin irritation when I got in the bed  The hotel allows pets and I thought be that or smoke residue had something to do with my reaction  Secondly there were large number of young people staying at the hotel  They were noisy well into  am  I couldnt sleep in late the next morning as there was construction going on outside  Front desk service was very efficient but they never asked how my stay was  be they heard complaints about the noise the night before The hotel is what I had paid for  I probably would not seek out this hotel the next time but if you dont mind pet hairs and some noise the hotel is solid  
P => Nice stay Similar to many other reviewers I got a good deal on Priceline for this hotel  A last minute trip I was quite pleased with the hotel  In regards to some of the other reviews the hotel is now under reation  The lobby was being reated when I was at the hotel and some of the guest rooms had been partially updated some new furniture some old tvs etc  Ordered room service my first night there it was ent and not too terribly over priced  Front desk was helpful with directions and the hotel in general was pretty convenient  I didnt really explore around the hotel very much because I was busy all day but it looked like a quieter area  It is the hotel where many of the Air Canada flight attendants and pilots were staying  
P => Nice Location My wife and I had a great experience at this hotel  I was a little worried after it popped up on Priceline after reading some of the reviews  I got it for  Located next to the Sherbrooke Metro station and close to Rue St  Denis and Rue St  Laurent Friendly efficient valet  Excellent front desk staff  Fresh chocolate chip cookies upon check in CA valet parking in heated garage  I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Acceptable     I got this hotel for  on Priceline  It is not a flawless Hilton property  It is an older hotel with many signs of its former Holiday Inn days  The location is OK right next to the Sherbrooke Metro station  
P => Beautiful hotel   a bit of a walk to everything Beautiful hotel the gym was above average but all the clubs and bars are about  blocks away  Which is not as fun duriing the wintercold  The key to finding all the spots is once you step out of the place make a right and keep walking until you see signs of life  
P => Good location good price good rooms Contrary to several of the previous reactions my experiences with this hotel were entirely positive  I found this hotel an excellent choice and I would most certainly stay here again when coming back to Montreal quiet and well isolated room clean and spacious with very comfortable bed airconditining functioned very well  degrees all day through good location on Sherbrooke and Berri next to a metro stop close to a large selection of restaurants very friendly and helpful service excellent breakfast buffetI paid  Canadian dollars per night for a single room booked through the hotel website  
P => Ok place to stay Stayed here with my husband and  young boys  First thing to know is the parking is underground and the fee is  per day if you park it yourself  per day if you use the valet please note the parking is not the responsibility of the hotel but a erate company  Also note that you cant fit a large SUV or truck down here we have a Toyota Tacoma that barely fit  The hotel is nice and the rooms were comfortable kind of warm in the room during the summer even with the AC turned all the way up we had a great view of the city  They could probably use some reations to the bathroom area our toilet had a big crack in it and the ceiling looked like it was falling apart  Never saw anyone working at the conceriege desk  Hotel staff was friendly  Pool area is not the greatest but ok for a short swim  Very close to the Metro  All and all a good stay  
P => Just Horrible Stayed at this hotel before but I have to say this is hotel is going downhill  No air conditioning  I complain and the GM who I found out after was the owner tells me this is normal it is very hot and they are working on the situation  An employee passes by and a funny smile and a discouraged face looks at me and just shock his head  Then a funny looing man comes next to the GM and says the same story how they are working on it but all hotels with central AC are going threw the same thing Well I told them I was checking out and he rudely looked at me and said we are better off without you As I was leaving the hotel I saw the employee that shock his head and asked him why he did that He looked at me in a very discouraged way and said Ive worked here for  years and every year its the same  The owner has to put in a new system and it would cost over  so he just patches the problem and talks storys to the brand  I have to say i was shoked but at the same time I wasnt surprised since the owner looked like the type to do that  Just watch the God Father and you will see some major look alike and his right hand fool next to himNever stay here trust me 
P => Quiet room comfortable bed I had booked a room for  nights  Upon arrival I was given a room on the th floor  Once I got there I found that no matter what I tried to adjust the air conditioning thermostat it wouldnt work  The room was stuffy and very warm  Obviously the air conditioning wasnt working  I immediately called front desk and they sent a repairman to fix the problem but unfortunately it couldnt be fixed so they offered to give me a different room  The staff was very helpful in changing me to another room  I was then given a corner room with two windows on the th floor with better air conditioning and a beautiful view  The room had two regular size beds which were very comfortable lots of fluffly pillows the shower worked great although the counter space is very limited  I had a nice desk with a CD player a good sized TV to the right of both beds  The maids came in daily to clean the room the bathroom and replace toiletries although they didnt replace the toilet paper much  However on my way out in the mornings I usually saw a maid working and asked her for the toilet paper and she was very friendly and helpful with whatever I needed in the room I found the restaurant a bit pricy but that is the norm for hotels restaurants which didnt surprise me so I usually ate on one of the many inexpensive places on Rue St  Dennis or had breakfast on a little pastry shop around the corner from the hotel inside the metro station The hotel is located on a hill so if you walk to the restaurants on Rue St  Dennis it can get tiring if youre not used to walking much  The metro station is right next to the hotel and there is also a bus stop right around the corner Overall the staff was always very helpful and they spoke both english and french  The only thing that I didnt like was the fact that the air conditioning didnt work very well  The lobby and the restaurant were always warm and although I got a cooler room than I originally had the air conditioning was on the warm side and some nights I woke up sweating during the night  
P => Filthy room   packing up  days early So I arrive at ten at night with two small children  Tired stressed wanting somewhere nice to lay my head  I had booked this hotel for five days  Imagine my disgust at the hairs in the bathroom sink floor tub and the used cotton bud in the middle of the floor in our room  I believe you get what you pay for   and I would have expected to pay half the amount for this standard  We are on the  floor and can hear traffic like its next door  Everything looks cheap too except for the reception area  Dont stay here if your standards of hygeine are high 
P => Another great location in Montreal We usually stay in the main part of downtown so it was nice to check out a different area  We had a great time St Denis street is a very short walk away Just For Lhs Festival was on   Amigos is a great restaurant   good food at good prices Our room had a great view and we have no problems to report     we would definitely stay there again 
P => Executive vs Standard rooms This is my nd stay in this hotel in  months  This time I had booked an executive room st floor for an entire week and stayed with my partner Basically unless you need the quotfree Internetquot in your room and plan on having breakfast ideally for  everyday the executive room is not worth it  Mine was actually smaller than the standard room in which I stayed the st time on the th floor  As a Hilton Honors member Silver I did not get a corner room which are the ones that are bigger for the same price  That being said that small quotexecutive roomquot was ideal to watch the fireworks competition from the hotel and offered a view on the Olympic stadium To put things in perspective you get what you pay for  This hotel is little tired and has some issues with air cond  plumbing and repairs here and there  But for the price it is an excellent value  The views are great because of its location on Sherbrooke St and the beds just fantastic 
P => Mmmm Chocolate Went to Montreal for the Just for Lhs festival and the Doubletree had the best location right around the corner from the festival site and the best price I could find   a night for a Fri Sat stayI saw a few megative reks here about the hotel but I ided to give this place a try anyway  Check in was great we showed up early noon and asked if we could check in early it wasnt a problem the girl was very friendly and best of all gave us the famous doubletree chocolate chip cookiesI didnt expect much from the room as when I had stayed at the Doubletree in New Orleans the room had been very standard so I was very pleasantly surprised at the size of the room and the great view we were on the th floor The beds were incredible and reminded me of the perfect sleeper beds at the Hyatt  The only problem I had during our stay was that the air conditioning didnt seem to work was not a problem as the window had a small opening at the bottom that opened to provide an incredible breeze as well once we notified the front desk they offered to move us or send up a fan we chose the fan and it was perfect  
P => Location vs Dirty carpet This hotel was the weirdest mix of extremely positive qualities with some pretty unsavory ones but I ultimately have to conclude that the good outweighted the bad  For some reason we were put on the quotexecutivequot floor which was amazing and unexpected but  have had something to do with the person who booked the room being a Hilton Honors member  Shortly after arriving a staff member knocked on our door with a plate of chocolate candies and raspberry sauce compliments of the hotel  I had never encountered such a thing and Ill be darned if I wasnt starting to plan my  star review that Id later be writing on TripAdvisor  Unfortunately that did not distract me from the fact that the carpet hadnt been vacuumed and wasnt during the entire  day stay  To top it off the air conditioner was defective and could not be fixed meaning we had to open the windows for any hint of fresh air  That being said though the location was phenomenal and its so close to the Metro we didnt take the car out the entire time  I can see how my experience might have been colored by having some of the perks of the Hilton Honors program   amazing room free internet unexpected chocolate   and without these I might not have been as satisfied  I am hesitantly recommending this hotel I mean the location cant be beat and the staff is tremendous but I would also suggest that you check all your options before seeing the quotDoubletreequot name and instantly being impressed  
P => Good solid hotel I am a Diamond Hilton Honors Member so that  reflect the positive stay I had given so many of the negative reviews on here  I was given a great suite with a fantastic view of the city  the room was clean and spacious  Breakfast was good and the service was great  The hotel lobby and general areas seemed clean and well maintained  Overall a good experience  
P => Not recommended I stayed for business  nights in this hotel Except the cookies upon arrival this hotel is not a Double Tree quality hotel   Parking is very small with a lot of mess inside  Please do not let the valet to park your car  Mine was scratched  I told the valet and his answer was that he did nothing  He told me that I probably scratched it      Restaurant on the hotel card its written that the restaurant closes at   p m  WRONG I arrived twice at   p m  and the waiter told me that the kitchen closes at   p m  After arguing that the hotel says  p m  he offered me to have a sandwich       Room Service I ordered everyday a breakfast at   a m  from room service  Except the  first mornings when they served at time the other mornings or they arrived at   or   a m  or never Its the same for room service by night many times I called them but nobody answered  I had to call reception and complaint to get something   Rooms are quite clean even if the bathtub ant toilets are not really clean and are old I would not recommend this hotel  Next time I come back to Montreal i will choose another one  
P => Exceeds Expectations Amazing Service My husband and I have been the victims of rude service at several hotels in South Florida where we live  That is why we are so appreciative of the Doubletree in Montreal  The price was very cheap we did it through their rate called the  daysaver  We recieved fresh hot cookies at check in and a hand written note in our from the lady who booked our stay  The room was fantastic with a lot of space and  floor to ceiling mirrors on  of our walls  When we had to book an additional nights stay at the last minute they graciously gave us the same rate we got for our advance purchace  I highly recommend the doubletree to anyone staying in Montreal  Especially if you enjoy walking   it is within walking distance of everything and the subway is connected to the hotel and super convenient  
P => We loved the Doubletree My boyfriend and I stayed at the Doubletree in Montreal from      I read the reviews of the hotel before we booked our stayed and noticed some of the reviews were a bit negative but ided to try it anyway  We were glad we did  The rooms were very nice not elegant or fancy more on the plainly orated side but very comfy  The bed was terrific Very comfortable with a down duvet  Reminded us of home  The room was quiet and had an unbelievable view of downtown Montreal and the surrounding areas  We had dinner the first night in the hotel and it was a bit pricey but the food and the service were excellent  I noticed some of the reviews mentioned the parking lot being unsafe or dirty etc  I must say that if you have ever parked in an underground parking garage in the city that they are all the same  I didnt think it was bad at all and not something I would have thought twice about let alone write about it in a review of the hotel  You park your car get on the elevator which takes you directly into the lobby and you dont see it again until you leave  Not a big deal at all and definitely not something that should be a iding factor of whether or not you stay at this hotel  I would think all parking garages are the same  When touring the city of Montreal dont drive take the Metro It was so easy to use and will get you anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes  Its clean and safe and much better than driving and parking  The metro is the way to go 
P => Bed bugs galore    There were a number of problems with our stay at the time of reservation my credit card was charged the full and incorrect amount although the rate required only  night deposit  I reserved a king size room and was willing to pay more for that however upon arrival we were given a lousy queen room with none of the services offered for the executive king rate and we had to pay as if we stayed in the executive king room The room was ok but the bathroom was badly maintained   the fixtures looked old and worn off there was hair in the towels and in the tub  There were a number of hotels in the area we could have booked but having a  month old we wanted to have an indoor pool hence the choice went to the Doubletree hotel in Montreal  What a major disappointment that was  The pool looked nothing like the picture on the hotels website  the lighting was dim the ceiling had big chunks of paint peeling off and bubbling and falling into the pool  There was water everywhere  The water in the pool was extremely cold so we couldnt even let the baby go into it  The mirrors were cracked  The towels in the pool area were too small even for a toddler they looked like hand towels  What a horrible sight and a complete waste of money  and last but not least   BED BUGS  Everyone in our party  adults and  child included my parents booked a different room that was located  floors below us got bite ks all over our bodies  We were itching and scratching our entire stay  You can expect something like that during the th century but in the st century What a major disappointment This is my second stay at the Doubletree hotels and trust me I am not going back there  I usually trust the Hilton brands but after this trip I am seriously reconsidering ever staying at any of the Hilton properties in the future  IF it wasnt for the beautiful scenery our trip would have been completely ruined because of the hotel conditions  
P => Good ent Hotel We stayed for  nights in Doubletree Montreal on Rue de Sherbrooke   it was ideally placed   right next door to the Sherbrooke Metro whichwas so handy to everywhere  The hotel check at pm was seamless andstraightforward  We had booked a non smoking room and our room had the smell of stale smoke   we were offered an alternative room straight away   which when we looked at it wasnt as good as the smoky room so staff came up straight away with air freshener to sort the room out The room was big   TV iron amp board hairdyer neutrogena products robes good powerful shower radios that could plug in an ipod and broadband if required The bed was huge and really comfy Great view from our nd floor Breakfast was included and it was great a good hot and cold selection  Staff were ever so polite ensuring you were called by name The best bit   the signature Doubletree cookies   when we asked we were given a second one Worth it for the cookies alone   warm with the chocolate chips just starting to melt   mmmmmmmmm   l want one now 
P => Loved the Doubletree I stayed for a convention and was spectacle on the the quality of the hotel since we usually do meetings in  star properties but was surprised in the quality of the hotel  My bedroom was magnificent and was huge  I asked other colleagues and they were also amazed to see the size of the bedrooms  Beautiful white duvet covers and full of pillows  The mattress were amazing better than the one I have at home and I paid a lot for it The only downfall was the heat in the bedrooms it was rather warm and I just could not get the heat to go down  I called and they came to fix it but it still was rather warm  Other than that I truly enjoyed my stay and it was a great  nights at this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Montreal  
P => Loved the Doubletree Had a great time at the hotel staff was so nice and the hotel rooms were great  I love the bed didnt want to leave it was so confortable  THe only problem we had is we found that we always had to wait for the valet  There was only one valet and even a man from the front desk came to help but it wasnt enough  They really need to put more staff  The parking was confusing and they made us pay again when we left because they said they had no arrangements with the hotel  So why did the hotel makes us pay They need to get themselves organized  Please note that they have lots of crap old chairs carpet tables and so on in the garage S amp S  Im assuming they will get this garbage out ASAP because it really does not look good Althought this inconvience I really enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again if they get more staff and the parking in order

P => Good Amenities Excellent Location    My wife and I stayed at this hotel for  nights  This hotel is at an excellent location right on Rue Sherbrooke Ouest West  We found that the property was fairly new and well maintained  All of the staff we encountered spoke French amp English and happily switched between both based on our interaction  The rooms were extremely clean  Having free access to WiFi as well as a microwave and refrigerator in the room were really helpful  The bathroom in  our  room did not have a tub  be a concern for some   not an issue for us Staying at this hotel will put you within walking distance of the Metro Place des Arts as well as restaurantsshopping Rue  St  Catherine etc  The hotel offers underground parking for  CAD a day  We didnt experience a problem finding a spot in their facility and left the car there for the duration of our stay walked and used the Metro  Overall I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel  I have visited Montreal several times and have stayed at a couple of other properties  We found a very good rate for this stay and would certainly stay here again if the price is right  
P => Great Property This is a great hotel Its a new property and it has a great location in downtown Montreal  Staff is very friendly and welcoming makes you feel like youre at home  The rooms are really nice and they have a beautiful pool and fitness room and a great restaurant  Would definetly return and recommend this hotel to everyone 
P => Overall good Near McGillsights and food Good rainy foggy weekend  Rooftop gym good   treadmills need fixing  Hotel restaurant surprisingly good value  
P => Excellent Stay Restaurant was delicious  Service was excellent Would defintely recommend it Rooms are very spacious  Beds and pillows are very comfortable Great location downtown Montreal Great pool with great views and very nice workout facility  
P => Awesome Inn Great hotel   very comfortable and affordable    probably the best quotbang for your buckquot in the downtown core Would recommend this to everyone Ppl were pleasent and very helpful CiaoJ 
P => Didnt Meet My Standards For HGI Stayed here one night because Hilton Bonaventure was full  The check in staff were lackluster and didnt recognize me as a Hilton Diamond though I did receive a breakfast chit which I didnt use  I was given what appeared to be a room for disabled persons and wasnt informed of it  With me you get one chance to get it right  I didnt complain I rarely do I just dont come back  This place charges for everything that is gratis at most hotels including  disposable razor and for a plug adaptor  I think one can do much better for the money elsewhere in Montreal  
P => Nice comfortable business hotel We paid about CAD  plus taxes but ended up booking rather late for a large conference that probably filled many hotels so we werent TOO unhappy about the rate  And the room was nice clean modern with comfortable beds and a very comfortable chair at the desk  Large flat screen TV  Problem with showers wate pressurewater heat was fixed after I asked  Use of the computers and printer in the business center was free  Only one laundry room that i saw but I had no trouble getting access to the machine  The pool and exercise room areas were large and modern with a ent view  The restaurantbar area struck me as rather sterile and often a bit quotdeadquot and also kind of pricey but not outrageous the bar and restaurant at the nearby Holiday Inn had a warmer atmosphere  Breakfast seemed the big meal of the day in the restaurant  The room had a refrigerator and microwave oven and we used both  Front desk personnel were often but not always helpful in securing info about shopping directions etc  It was not much more than a  minute walk to the nearest Metro station  Convention center a bit over  minutes and Old Montreal be  uphill coming back  We did see an occasonal person asking for money but the statement about avoiding Bleury St  because one would be hassled by homeless people seemed like hyperbole  Overall the hotel wasnt exceptionally warm or atmospheric but clean modern and adequate for most any traveler   
P => Good Location This is a new Hilton and the hotel is in great shape  Service was excellent and more attentive than at most Hilton Garden Inns in the US  Parking is under the hotel and was about  CAD per night  Its on rue Sherbrooke and is in a good location for exploring Montreal  The block or two surrounding the hotel is nothing special but Its close to the dining on rue St  Laurent and just a couple of blocks from St  Catherine so its easy to walk to most downtown attractions  Old Montreal is a little less convenient  walkable if the weather is OK but otherwise a quick taxi ride  The hotel has a nice pool and hot tub on the th floor with a bit of a view and the fitness room though small had ent equipment in it  Theres a bar and restaurant in the lobby  Didnt have dinner there but the breakfast buffet was very good  We got a great deal on the room so it was definitely worth it  Rooms were large and well orated  Only quirk of the hotel was that the elevators required you to use your room key to activate them  This was only a mild annoyance  just remember to get multiple keys when you check in  Dont know why they do this  Its a perfect place for exploring Montreal  Theres also a riott Courtyard next door  
P => The best Hotel Service Restaurant what i have all over Canada The people are very friendly have knowledge do a very good service and look after you  
P => Most amazing stay and staff beyond expectations th time visiting montreal have stayed at  different hotel chains but this time we selected the Hilton Garden inn  The best choice we could have made  The rooms were spacious and the beds amazing we have even contacted the hotel for a contact to buy one for home  The Hotel was very clean and the staff made us feel right at home hats off to Lisette at the front desk and Fausto the doorman  We had all our meals at the restaurant Circos which all were amazing first time in a hotel where we ate all our meals in the Hotel the selection and quality exceeded our expectations  The pool and gym were great the view was amazing  Anybody visiting Montreal would be missing a lot if they do not stay at the Hilton Garden Inn  
P => Nice enough hotel but away from the main sights  Stayed in Montreal a couple of nights during a fly drive around Lake Onatario and the St Lawrence River  Eventually arrived at the Hotel after terrible traffic along Sherbrook Street and the check in was very smooth if a little rushed given key and pointed towards the car park  The room was large and the bathroom was spacious very clean and plenty of towels  As the weather closed in and it started to pour down we ided to eat in the hotels restaurant it was very pricey but we thought wed treat ourselves  There were plenty of waiting staff and they were all very nice but hadnt a clue what to do they all stood around fell over each other and the whole meal took almost  hours we waited and waited and eventually got our fillet mignon which was tiny and very over orated infact the meal looked a mess what we english class as looking like a dogs dinner im sure you understand that meaning it looked like a child had been let loose in the kitchen we then waited  minutes for desert which was pulled from a big catering box right by us so much for home cooking This was supposed to be fine dining McDonalds could have done better Needless to say we didnt eat there again  Also the hotel is a good half an hour away from the main river side sights its close to the shops and a rather dodgy area down Bleury Street dont go down even in the day youll be hassled by homeless people  For the price we were charged we expected much better  
P => Great place except for the hard rock beds The h tel is very nice clean and the staff is very friendly Everything was perfect except for the beds DONT sit on the bed too hard because you could break a bone  Its a shame because we slept at Hiltons lots of time and the beds are usually very comfortable But the h tel is still nice 
P => The place to stay I Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Montreal last weekend Fausto Bellman knows the city as his recommendation where accurate and helpful  The hotel is new the rooms are modern and super clean the order less than rare The walk in shower booth was great as it was easy to get into  The pool and gym is great the views is fantastic  I even cht up on my reading on Saturday afternoon on the exterior terrace while my husband took an afternoon snooze this is on the roof top of the hotel in the middle of a major city We did not feel like going out on Friday night as we had traveled all day stayed in house for dinner the food is great better than I expected  It is not your typical Club sandwich hamburger hotel dinning room and is well priced for the quality you get  I Noticed locals having dinner which seemed to be repeat clients this is always a good sign the staff is young friendly and on the ballI would definitely go back and recommend this hotel  Let s face it clean room good environment friendly genuine staff amp great food  
P => The best place in Montreal We stayed here over the weekend this Hilton was recommended by some friends  The property is located so centrally to so many things shopping movies entertainment  Our room was clean we had a king bed with a great walk in shower  We enjoyed the swimming pool and great view biggest fitness center Ive ever seen in a hotel  The restaurant had above average food and the staff was very welcoming and friendly  We will be back for sure 
P => First time at a Hilton Garden Inn  Loved it After a loong drive from Niagara Falls Ontario to Montreal all I needed was to relax  I was extremely pleased to see that this hotel was more than I ever expected  The place is extremely clean and nicely orated  I loved our room  Their bed and linens are very comfortable  I also like the idea that they provide a regular hair dryer not those crappy ones attached on the wall  The hotel is a close walk to other sites in the city  Great stay in every way for me  Hotel staff especially the two concierge were very helpful and friendly  
P => Awesome stay at the Hilton Garden Inn My friend and I stayed three nights at the Hilton Garden Inn  The Hotel was very clean and comfortable and Im very picky in regards to hotel room cleanliness  The room was spacious and the bathroom was extremly clean  I had a lovely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn  It was a short min walk to the shopping area and a  minute walk to the nightlife on St Denis and St Laurent  It is not walking distance to the Old Port but a few metro stops away  in short great location  The staff always had a smile  The room had a lovely view of the city and the Gym located at the top floor was clean and efficient along with a pool that families and kids enjoyed  The cardio equipment was basic but good enough to work out  There is also a nice patio with a great view of the city  I would definitely recommend and stay here again  Upon check out we had a slight problem with the charges per night for the room but it was quickly resolved with no fuss  
P => Wonderful Hotel   highly recommend After a lot of research and not being able to get a reservation at another hotel I picked this hotel one the reviews and photos posted here  And Im happy I did   we loved it nad were very comfortable  We stayed  nights  Hotel is very very clean and new    very important to me  The beds are super comfortable and rooms big enough   we had a room with  queens  Hotel location is good too    you have to walk a bit to get to places but  to  minute walk is just fine  We loved it We had breakfast in the hotel and it was excellent too  
P => Very nice central hotel in Montreal After going through the Trip Advisor reviews as well as other sites we settled on The Hilton Garden in  Absolutely agree with those in favor of the hotel  The hotel staff from front desk to maids were always friendly and helpful with any questions posed to them  It is centrally located on busy Sherbrooke Ave so you can get anywhere easily  Yet at night you dont hear anything that would disturb your sleep  One block from McGill Univ  so there is constantly pedestrian traffic of locals tourists and college students  Rooms were all clean and comfortable  Parking under the hotel with no quotin outquot limits as part of the daily fee  My only mild complaint is that though the beds are all large kings or queens they are quite firm even though they have an adjustable firmness dial on them  All in all between the wonderful staff ample sized pleasant rooms parking and central location with the very reasonable price we were very happy with this choice  Trip Advisor reviews were right on again  
P => Simply love it everything wonderful and close to the main attractions Everything was great we complain about the noise because there was a construction nearby and they gave us  adjacent rooms instead of a suite which was kind of small for  aldults and a year old in the other part of the hotel where it was al quiet without any extracharge  Very clean and very happy to be there  We d go back again 
P => Spacious room great location We stayed here with two teenage dhters during ust and were very pleased  The room was larger than an average hotel room so we had plenty of space for the four of us  The room was clean and up to date  Our only complaint was that daily room service never seemed to get everything right  During our four day stay we had to request additional towels and toilet paper several times  Hotel staff were prompt in handling these requests so it was only a minor inconvenience We didnt eat at the hotels restaurant but we did use the swimming pool and gym facilities   they were excellent  The view of Montreal from the rooftop pool and gym was great The hotels location couldnt have been better  There was a Metro stop a block away and we were within easy walking distance of Saint Catherines street for shopping  They were numerous cafes etc  in close proximity for morning breakfast As noted in other reviews the hotel seems secure due to the use of room cards to access the upper floors and facilities of the hotel We will definitely stay here again ifwhen we return to Montreal  Of course we could easily write another review on how much we enjoyed the city of Montreal  
P => Great Hotel Stayed here for the weekend and had an amazing time  Staff was friendly and very eager to help  The hotels location could not have been better     steps away from the metro and with the right shoes you can literally walk to the best spots  Walking distance to St  Catherine commercial shopping center St  Laurent barsrestoslounges  Amenities were great too amazing pool and hot tub and a sunning patio too  Great for relaxation after a long day around the city  
P => Fantastic Hotel I loved this Hotel  Staff is super friendly and helpful Awsome atmosphere  I stayed for a Wedding and everything went great  No complaints at all If you are looking for a Hotel near everything downtown this is the one 
P => Great Location and a Cut Above Most HGIs but watch out for the parking I picked this hotel because I was attending a conference at McGill and I also was staying around for some vacation afterwards  I found this hotel a cut above most HGIs in the US  Because Im a Gold member I got upgraded to a sort of minisuite a large room with a sort of dogleg with a sofa armchair TV and kitchen  The dogleg was a little too small to relax in but it made a nice buffer against noise in the corridor  All in all it was a very quiet comfortable room although Ive been told that you want to avoid the rooms on the Sherbrooke Street side  The restaurant had better food and selection than your usual HGIs it is hard to get a bad meal in Montreal I found  Plus it is open late  But because its an HGI amenities such as wireless internet are free  The service in general was excellent  The hotel is also conveniently located in the central part of Montreal within walking distance to McGill downtown great restaurants and tourist attractions The only downside is the parking which is expensive and inconvenient as the other reviewers have noted  We did not have any problem with the lot filling up since ust is apparently a slow time but we found it cramped with only room for one car at a time in the two way lanes  It would help if the management painted a pedestrian walkway on the lower level ramps since that is the only means pedestrians have of getting to higher level floors  However we were able to live with the parking without any mishaps  Parking in general seems to be difficult in downtown Montreal although otherwise driving is convenient traffic not to bad at least in ust well ked roads abundant gas stations  If you can do without it Id recommend not getting a car  
P => FABULOUS HOTEL From the moment we walked in we LOVED this hotelThe staff was so helpful and extremly friendly We were thrilled with everything in this new hotel the best parts would have to beThe rooms were huge and the beds were soooooo comfy and it doesnt stop there the roof top pool and terrace were Amazing we spent the whole day up on the terrace in the sunshine  Not to mention location just a few steps from all the shopping tooI would highly reccommend this hotel we will definatley be coming back again and again 
P => Friendly staff great location wonderful sunrises This hotel was wonderful The bartender was willing to banter the front desk was helpful the concierge was so wonderful and quite handsome  The hotel itself is located within walking distance of most of what youll want to visit provided you dont mind walking a little  There are maps available at the front desk  The swimming pool and jacuzzi were a nice relief at the end of a day of walking  Overall a wonderful hotel with wonderful people  
P => our first choice in montreal My wife and I have stayed here twice in the last  months and will stay here again  The hotel is very clean nice rooms and a very good location  Walk a few blocks and you have the metro shopping UniversitySt  Catherines and restaurants St  Laurent  The breakfast at the hotel is good  Best kept secret the open veranda on the th floor    perfect if you want to enjoy a good book and a great view  
P => Best stay ever  I stayed at this hotel for a week in y and have to say that I have never been so impressed by a hotel I have to travel a lot in my line of work therefore I have to stay in a lot of hotels The stay was impeccable from the moment I first checked in  After a delayed flight I was greeted by a warm smile from the front desk clerk who was not only sympathetic but I was amazed at how ALL of my special requests that I had made through my online booking were met  It was a delight to see how quickly I was served During my stay I often opted for the hotel restaurant and room service  The food is absolutely amazing but astonishingly well priced as well and as usual served with a smile The hotel services from the gym all new equipment to the pool location everything was beyond perfect The rooms are perfectly orated with a touch of coziness and modern sophistication  The hotel in its entirety is hands up the cleanness hotel I have ever been to Everyone working in this hotel is very attentive to the guests needs and does it with a genuine smile  Definitely a five star hotel that I recommend without a moments hesitation  
P => Dont waste your time We stayed at this hotel for  nights at the end of e  We are two parents and  teenagers so we booked a room with a suite erate door to a hide a bed  Checking in was simple  At first we thought we were on Candid Camera  We opened the hotel room door and walked into the hallway where there was a couch and tv   oh this must be a den   nope This was what they called the ior suite part of the room  As a matter of fact   we had to totally move around the furniture in order for the pull out bed to pull out and still allow us access to the door Okay   so we had to move the furniture and it wasnt as big as we are used to      the shower was another episode of Candid Camera Everytime I turned on the shower the water barely came out  Each time a maintenance man came   of course the shower sprayed Well it is a good thing I had a sense of humour cuz I was ready to go to the Salvation Army just to have a shower I finallyinsisted that the maintenance man take apart the shower and low and behold there was some plastic something that got into the pipes somehow at sometime during the reations    blah blah blah   and they finally got it working  It still wasnt a great shower   but it was wet and warm We bought the breakfast included option   but slept through it all but one day  There is a superket literally at the end of the block  There is a delicious creperie just at the corner too  The parking actually filled up one night and we had to beg and plead for them to help us find another option  They gave us the managers spot  Oh we ordered room service one evening   the food came very quickly hot and yummy The location is very good   Sherbrooke is a great street for easy access to Downtown old Montreal Six Flags restaurants and shopping We ate at Gibbys one night in Old Montreal with some friends who live in Montreal    Very expensive   but great service and super deliciousMy parents and my sisters family stayed at Hotel du Fort in a suite and they were really happy Hope this helps Anyways the staff who are all really polite and friendly 
P => Clean spacious room in a great location Travelled with a colleague to Montreal for the weekend and found out to my silent delight that my room and bathroom   was much larger than his  Although we paid the same rate CAD  I dont know the reason behind the discrepancy  Nonetheless both rooms were clean and tastefully furnished  The chair at the desk was fully adjustable and made working on my laptop much easier  I have been in many hotels where the chair is a standard upholstered chair and the height is really not suitable for business travellers  The bathroom x was large and toiletries were by Neutrogena  Do note there is no bathtub  The Hotel provided a Get Fit Kit for free by request  This comprised of a medicine ball  dumbells a yoga mat a resistance band and some other exercise gear  Great for a workout in your own room I took a peek at the gym and the small indoor pool and was not that enticed to use either I did not have breakfast included in my room rate but did not have difficulty finding food around the hotel  Theres a cafe in the basement of the building just a min walk away turn left when you exit the hotel that serves a ent eggs benedict and pancakes  Theres a creperie turn right when you exit and its on the corner that had jars of nutella in the window Very tempting    I ate at the lobby restaurant late one night and found the generous serving of smoked beef sandwich quite tasty  The chocolate souffle was a little too runny in the middle for my liking  Although the food was not outstanding it was reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant  Location as other reviewers have mentioned is great  Its a short walk to the metro station and the concierge will call you a cab to the airport if needed  Id stay here again and would recommend anyone to do the same 
P => Excellent hotel and highly recommended My husband and I stayed at this hotel on our recent trip to Montreal and loved it  We were upgraded to a suite and the room was comfortable spacious and well appointed  The breakfast buffet includes a nice selection of breads cereals and meatscheeses and cook to order plates  As nice as the room was the staff and the location helped make it truly wonderful  The concierge was fabulous he had great tips for our sightseeing plans and arranged for a reliable cab to pick us up at  a m  to take us to the train station  He was also just a lot of fun to talk to  The location was also wonderful  We never took a cab or public transportation while in Montreal  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see  The hotel is centrally located between Old Town and shopping district  The view of the city from the rooftop terrace is also a plus  I would highly recommend Hotel Hilton Garden Inn 
P => Nice hotel great service We have stayed at this hotel twice now and on both occasions the rooms have been nice and clean and the staff extremely helpful  They communicate politely in both French and English  The breakfast is served in the typical Hilton Garden Inn Model with a buffet of continental breakfast foods and ordering of cooked breakfast and it is nice It is only a  minute walk to the Metro and not too far to Rue St Catherine  
P => Great Stay at the Hilkton Garden Inn Montreal Had a recent one night stay at the HGI in Montreal downtown and had a great time The rooms are fresh large and well maintained and are much larger than some of the older and more expensive places in town  The hotel is about a ten minute walk from all of the citys action areas and had an excellent weekend rate The food for breakfast was ent and th staff were helpful  We had a problem with our room AC not working but this was soon sorted out and we were given another room and also free parking as a gesture of goodwill  Overall a great if short stay and would recommend this hotel  
P => Fantastic place and deal My wife and I were looking for an affordable but nice place to stay for a couple of days in Montreal  What a treat this was to discover Huge rooms and well done or  The place is clean and the staff is very friendly and speaks fine English  The front desk manager responded immediately to our only issue a shower door seal that leaked   she moved us to a larger room with a better view without even being asked  And the mattress was fantastic 
P => Better than most resorts I have stayed at Stayed here once before and chose to return while my house was being painted simply for all the little extras that amaze me like the unbelievable sun k that makes you feel like your on a  star resort overlooking the city  Bring a book and spend some time up there  combined with the salt water pool  its breath takingI was a bit pessimistic about the breakfeast buffet because I didnt see the traditional hot plates of runny scrambled eggs and potatoes but after having my omlette made to order to my taste and then having the ultra friendly staff convince me to try their waffles also made freshly for me I am afraid I wont be able to settle for less from now on  
P => Nice Stay in Montreal Overall a nice stay and a little nicer than your typical Hilton Garden Inn  The only thing that wasnt that great was the breakfast  Also watch if you go to the pool   the pavement is extremely slippery  Im almost fell walking to the hot tub  Also the pictures of the outside of the hotel are eiving  The hotel is only about  stories high and the tall building next to it is condos I believe but is has the Hilton Garden Inn sign on it  Nice place overall  
P => Nice Hotel great service  My husband and I stayed here for Memorial Day weekend weve been to Montreal several times and usually stay in another hotel but ided to explore our options for this trip  We were happy with our choice the hotel is clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful  We were concerned that it would be too far out of our way but were happy that the hotel was within walking distance from St Catherine  The only thing I would mention is that their undergroung parking is somewhat confusing   we had no problem getting in but there is now exit sign so we had to stop and ask someone  We would stay here again  
P => Great for families   brand new beautiful staff was very accomodating We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for one night during a quick stay in Montreal a city we know well  The location is terrific and the hotel was immaculate  We came with three kids and wanted one room  Our room had two queen beds and we requested a cot  When the front desk realized that we had three kids they assigned us a corner room which was lovely and spacious  Beds were amazingly comfortable 
P => The Only Place To Stay in Montreal  This hotel was simply great Living in Vermont Montreal is a city we visit several times a year for leisure  Out of the over  hotels we have stayed at over the years this one is simply the best Kristine at the front desk was wonderful  super quick check in The cleanliness of this hotel was just spectacular The room was beyond spacious and you must check out the pool hot tub and sunk even if not planning on using it its worth a quick peek just for the view alone  The gym and steam room were state of the art  My only small complaint would be that those huge fabulous windows we enjoyed upon arrival would have been even better with black out shades and not just the thinner shear curtain that allows a ton of light in the early am  Easy fix with an eye mask This hotel is by far the best Hilton we have ever stayed at anywhere 
P => Will Never Stay Anywhere Else in Montreal We just got back from a two night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and weve ided that we will never stay anywhere else when visiting Montreal in the future  Amazingly clean and spacious rooms incredibly friendly and helpful staff and great location all that we could ever ask for and more There is also a Coras steps from the hotel so that was a BIG plus for us There was also a fantastic bistro on the SE corner of Sherbrooke and Bleury with an owner who was one of the nicest people that we have ever met This hotel is HIGHLY recommended 
P => Not your normal HGI    TOP OF THE TOP Being an elite member of several hotel chains I have to say that this Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Montreal is the way above the best The staff are ultra attentive and are willing to bend over backward for any and all request If you dont have time to grab a bite out be sure to visit the hotel restaurant for an amazing meal presented in  star fashion all while tantalizing your taste buds For a week of business or a long weekend get away this Hilton has it all  Check in and forget the hassles    focus on whats important  
P => One of the better Hilton Properties Normally I find that Hilton properties tend to be overrated  Understandably during a UFC weekend in Montreal the prices were inflated but the price of this Hilton was surprisingly competetive compared to other hotels in the area but on a non event weekend even in the summer its cheap at night  The location is excellent walking distance to both St  Laurent and St  Catherines so for nightlife and eating purposes its great  The service was amazing  I made the mistake of booking a king bd instead of the  queen I intended  This is one of the few that actually has  queens in the room by the way  After realizing the mishap we went back to the front desk and they were able to find a room to accommodate us with no extra charge  Room was simple but really clean with great comfy sheets and an amazingly comfortable bed  Us girls had a great sleep  I work for public health in Toronto so Im very cautious about hotels and its cleanliness  This location was very well kept  Security was amazing as well as you need to swipe your room card in order to access the elevators the parking garage and pretty much virtually every part of the hotel  The staff really make everything easy for their patrons  I highly recommend it  
P => Very spacious and clean rooms Stayed here for one night while on business and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms  Was supposed to stay in a suite on the th floor according to my Hilton Honors preferences but at check in was told there was a construction elevator outside my window  I was given the option of looking at the room first and indeed the elevator was literally on the other side of the room window  I was not comfortable with this and within  minutes another room was found  Although the new room was not a suite it was plenty big enough for my needs with a great working area   comfy desk chair and plenty of light  Also the bathroom was huge with a big shower stall  The fitness centre had new equipment  I took a quick look at the pool which also seemed nice This is a more basic version of the Hilton brand meaning no room service in the morning  The buffet breakfast was OK   not the best Ive had but it served the purpose As I was there for work I cant really comment on the neighbourhood though it did seem a bit far east of the core and hence  not be the best for shopping etc  Also not sure of proximity to Metro stations  
P => Clean comfortable friendly staff    Perfect After a bad experience at another hotel in Montreal I checked into this trusty Hilton chain and I was so glad I did Check in was a breeze even at am  Front desk staff were very nice friendly and spoke English The room itself was spacious with a comfortable bed desk chair flat screen tv with many chanels coffee maker bar fridge microwave  Free wireless internet in the hotel Bathroom was clean good shower head new towels There is an indoor pool spa and gym on the top level  The pool was a little chilly for my liking but the spa was great after a long day  We ordered room service twice and both times were pleasantly surprised  Service was fast food tasted great and had a ent price tag as far as room service goes  The location was good very close to a metro station and grocery store  Everything was clean amp modern in the hotel and staff were very friendly and accomodating  I would recommend this hotel to other travellers to Montreal  Yes its a chain but at least you know you will get a clean comfortable and friendly establishment at the end of the day  
P => Loved the Hilton Garden Inn Loved the Hilton Garden Inn  I found it Grey Cup weekend after research I did online and after reading several reviews  I stayed here for  days  Its in a great location   close to the metro and a  minute walk to the heart of St  Catherines Street  McGill is nearby so theres lots of restaurants and shops  Old Montreal is close by metro or cab ride Rooms are ent size bright clean new and the beds are really comfortable  Daily housekeeping was efficient and did a great job  Microwaves fridges and coffee makers in each room were a nice touch The staff is friendly and helpful  The food and the restaurant is good and room service very reasonable  The fitness centre has about  cardio machines weight machines and free weights plus a pool hot tub and steam room  All were in great shape and never very busy I would definitely stay here again 
P => Very nice trip I chose Hilton by doing some research online  I read many reviews of the many hotels in the area  The fact that this one was new and had plenty of parking was important  And then getting a good rate through Expedia clinched the deal The staff was very helpful even offering a loan umbrella due to the rain outside  The room was very nice and clean  The beds were comfortable  The bathrooms were well stocked  Very much as desribed  Only one comment to add that  not be too flattering  I felt blindsided by the fact that I got a bill the next morning for  for parking in the garage  And that we got a  bill for breakfast when whe thought it was complimentary  Other than that an overall enjoyable experience  
P => GREAT FInd in Montreal This is a brand new property opened in ust  and hits on all cylinders  The rooms are well appointed good sized if not huge and include a safe coffee maker microwave and refrigerator  Everything works since it is all new  TV is hooked up to the local cable system so lots of channels both English and French are available  However pay to view movies are not available but you arent going to Montreal to watch movies are youThere is a great fitness room and indoor pool and sauna  In addtion to having a good quantity and quality of workout equipment the fitness room and pool are on the th floor and have large windows making for an attractive space The business center has two computers which is adequate and internet access is at no extra charge  The staff is very helpful and efficient and clearly eager to make a good impression and all were fluent in English  I assume they are fluent in French also and I heard one speaking German but since I dont know those languages I cant comment on the fluency of the staff in them As usual at most Hilton Garden Inns there is a not a full service restaurant but room service is offered and there is a small bar  A full breakfast buffett is offered including made to order omlettes  This was quite good  The location is in a pleasant residential area near McGill University so there are plenty of restaurants bars stores and services nearby  The Place Des Arts Metro station is two blocks away  It is not in Old Montreal nor in the heart of the business district but it is easy to get to both by Metro taxi or on foot  The only real disadvantage of the location is that it is not connected to the underground walkway system  There are several other hotels nearby including a Courtyard Holiday Inn Detla and Four Points but it is unlikely that any are superior to this property  
P => Love Love This Place The hotel opened on Wednesday  We stayed for two nites from Thursday to Saturday morning The rooms are great with flat screen TV small fridge aqnd WIFI access The pool is small but clean filled with salt water  The gym is well equipped with machines and weights The staff is great very friendly and bi lingual  The bartender is a sweetheart  The rest  is not great but who cares  you are within blocks of good dining There is underground parking for day We will be back  
P => Tr s bon Hilton bien situ  dans Montr al  A ne pas rater  
P => Excellent services et superbe hotel  
P => Un bon h tel encore en construction

P => Much more than I expected Traveled by train from QC with my dhter  and   Walked across the street from the station  Check in easy  Room   Average  But its not the room here Great location  The pool is great  When you go to swim there is an inside entry and you swim under a k to enter the Great White North   It was cold   Pony tailed lifeguard has zero personality but he is efficient  Girls loved the swim  I froze  Concierge staff is rekable   minutes before face off Roberto got me tickets   rows off the ice from a scalper  I paid him and picked up the tickets in a nearby gas station Thanksgiving American Concierge booked us at Globe  Incredible The restaurant  Had breakfast one day  Expensive  But friendly  Good  Waiter made a recommendation for the girls for that day ProblemsReturned one day    door ajar  Maid had not shut it  Nothing taken  Reasonably secure Bar is good too for a drink  Arrived  Wife out of sorts and sent her for a cocktail  She was much better A great location  Very non Hilton  Very personable  Unique I used points so I only paid for what I spent but it was good  Very good  Better than expected for a Hilton  And if you have kids and its the winter the pool is a gem  A class of French speaking children watched one afternoon as we swam  They all wanted to jump into the steamy outdoor pool And Im a runner  Old Montreal is a short run  A long walk  
P => First Class Luxury This hotel is recently remodled with lovely high class touches  The room is comfortable with large beds and a nice flat screen  It is a tri level floor plan without elevators so if you have a lot of luggage arrival can be tricky  The heated outdoor pool is very nice and the location of the hotel is excellent  just a short walk to either Old Montreal or shopping on Catherine  
P => Good location good service odd layout Friendly and professional service at check in and check out  Rooms were clean and well serviced but public areas were not always clean what looked like an Aleve tablet lay on stairs outside my bedroom for  days and was clearly visible on the dark carpet dirty plates left outside a room down the corridor from early morning till midnight lint on many stairs and hallways  Idiosyncratic layout of hotel with many stairs to go up and down before reaching a room made me wonder how guests who have difficulty in walking cope On my last evening a loud mechanical noise started close to my room  A hotel staff member came to my room could not locate the noise but promised to call back minutes later and to move me to another room  He never returned and reception did not know who the staff member in question was Was there for a business meeting and can commend staff in charge of meeting rooms audiovisual equipment etc  for being efficient knowledgeable polite and very professional  Lunch and drinks catering also went effortlessly and right on time Overall okay  Beds very comfy for me the most important aspect of any hotel and bed linen impeccably clean  Would be nice to have wi fi in the room free wi fi in lobby painfully slow  Given the price I would advise going to the Delta one block away if the room is used only for sleeping and save C  per night in the process  
P => A little austere in public areas but some nice features I stayed at the Hilton Bonaventure the last week of ober  Unfortunately my room had no heat  They gave me some space heaters as the hotel was sold out which made the room warm enough although they once flipped the circuit breaker  I think that they could have done more to compensate though in that I stayed  days and they gave me   off of  days which I think was a bit cheap of them  It has a nice gym and the executive lounge breakfast was well stocked as well as the attendant was extremely helpful making me a latte every morning  Good selection of appetizers in the evening but unlike many executive lounges the alcoholic beverages were not free Although I would have liked to try it it has a year round outdoor heated swimming pool and I think that is a big draw for this hotel  It also is built as the penthouse in a large office building and the rooftop is done as a nice garden with paths plants and trees  It makes for a nice oasis even though you are in the middle of the city  
P => Love this hotel and location You cannot beat staying at this hotel for its location and roof top oasis  The rooms have been updated been coming here since   Perfect location for Montreal  Great for both site seeing during the day and night life  Everything is walkable The rooms are large and clean  The rooftop pool is amazing lots of fun in the winter when it is snowing on you while swimming in a  degree pool  Only downside is the outrageous drink prices at the poo bar  Besides that we loved this hotel 
P => Great reations Wow The Hilton Montreal has made great reations since my last stay in The spectacular rooftop garden is always the main attraction of this architectural Icon from the sixties I liked the new rooms and Lobby 
P => A hidden gem in the heart of Montreal We like to stay in boutique hotels and this one had that feel without the high price tag  This unique hotel set on the roof of Place Bonaventure is quite a deal  We paid US through Priceline and would have paid more  The room and bathroom were comfy roomy clean and well appointed  We had a view into the unique rooftop garden  Where else can you find a rooftop koi pond with ducks We also took a dip in the heated rooftop pool  Plus the concierge was always helpful  You can take the elevator down to the Bonaventure Station to access stores restaurants and the metro station  Its also a quick walk to Old Montreal and St  Catherine Street Cant think of any complaints  Sure the pool was sometimes crowded and there were occasionally kids running through the halls but it was early y in Montreal  
P => Average Hilton The room was spacious furniture and bathroom a bit dated  A pity that the hotel restaurant isnt open in the evening  The bar is nice but very crowded  The overall feel in the hotel is that it s dated you dont get a luxurious feel  Although staff is extremely friendly and helpful  
P => Nice Nice hotel clean elegant beautiful roof top garden and kids love the roof top poolThe only problem for us is find the entrance 
P => A mixed bag Spent a week at the Bonaventure because colleagues had chosen it for a conference The rooms were fine clean adequately appointed  Neither the shaving mirror nor the bathroom audio worked  First  condoms Ive ever seen in the minibar The layout is bizarre and since I had supplemental oxygen toting the tank up and down the twelve steps to my room was laborious and mine was one of the quothandicapped accessiblequot rooms  Ha My colleague in a wheelchair was taken to her room by service elevator every time she came from her room for a meeting shopping or a meal  The underground shopping area was generous but again took literally scores of steps up and down to access some of the areas  What would it take to put a wheel ramp inThe lunches catered in house were dreadful  Spaghetti and frozen meatballs with pumpkin soup on Monday Pumpkin soup with spaghetti and curry on Tuesday cold spaghetti with Thai dressing on Thursday    you get the picture The service was magnificent  The staff was professional helpful cheerful and made up for many of the facilities shortcomings Depending upon what your goals are this could be a great stay or a great disappointment  
P => very pleasant staff no surprises The location is great for business and is close to the trendy galeries like the Fonderie Darling the activities on Place des Arts Chinatown and the quaint streets of Old Montreal  The staff was friendly helpful and knowledgeable from the lifeguard to the concierge to housekeeping to reception where I saw a manager efficiently assist a couple whod left a passport in their previous hotel before joking with me about our shared first name  Housekeeping was also very good about locating and returning something Id left in the room after I checked out The gym was adequate the pool looked nice though its position outside the reception windows was a bit odd  In fact the layout of the hotel spread out pretty much in a single layer the length of a city block is a little labyrinthine with a fair amount of walking to get from one place to the other  In its architecture concrete and glassed in green terraces is very much a reflection of a lot of Montreals boom between Expo  and the Olympics in  giving it a slightly dated feel rather than the Austin Powers cool it might have once had My standard room was a ent size  Again no bells or whistles just staightforward clean and sufficient For my taste Id pick something with a little more personality but its a chain and for the convenience of a chain it was absolutely fine  No complaints here  
P => Good location pretty hotel property and professional staff The hotel is located in the center of downtown Montreal just across the street from a Metro station and within walking distance of the Art museum shopping on St  Catherine street and Old Town Montreal  The hotel property is surrounded by gardens water features and offers a great pool and well equipped gym so it feels almost like a resort in the middle of the city  The concierge offered many good suggestions of moderately priced restaurants in the area that we wouldnt have found without his suggestion  
P => The Hilton made a difference with our stay in Montreal We had an excellent time at the Hilton It was our first time visiting Montreal and the Front Desk cant remember his name and the Concierge Roberto was friendly helpful and made a difference with our stay  They made reservations for us  and printed directions to Quebec City for the day  Room Service was fast and not as outrageous as I thought it would be  Some times you can hear people opening and closing their doors in the hall way but that is the extent of the noise  It didnt realy bother us since we were tired and had no problems sleeping Our hotel rooms were clean spacious and newly reated  The shower head was nice and strong and the beds were super comfortable  It was a very pleasant and enjoyable stay There was an outdoor heated pool and the life gaurd was kinda cute to look at  DIn the morning there is a timmys across the street along with a Mcdonalds and food court from the VIA rail station The Hilton is in the heart of downtown Montreal within walking distance of St  Catherines and Centre street   although its better to take a  taxi ride to centre street if youre in heels    I would recommend and stay at the hilton again  
P => Not if you paid me On a whim of a vacation that quite literally started out with a conversation like quotwanna go somewhere this weekendquot we ended up in Montreal Quebec and my first trip out of province  With no credit cards or reservations we ided to go and see what we could come up with unfortunately this idea landed us at the bonaventure We were told that there was a convention going on that day so of course this meant that the our room was right by the convention rooms where the events were still going on bagpipes at  at night and all  The room was basic two queen beds carpet TV a view of the city and a ensuite bathroom  So not worth the price of what we had to pay for the hotel room  When asked if there was anything we could recommend since we were out of town the girl at the front desk said quoteveryone was out of town and she didnt have time to discuss trivial matters quot the hotel lobby was dead what else did she have to doAt one point during the night my fiancee lost his cell phone in the cab and after playing tag with a few phone companies and his cell phone to try and find it the cab driver said that he would drop it off for us    After a trip to the front desk five minutes later we asked the same woman if anyone dropped a cell phone off from outside  She told us no  and we waited for the cab drive outside thinking that wed see him  After a twenty minute wait my fiancee went back to the front desk and talked to a very sweet man and went quotare you sure no one dropped off a cell phonequot he looked behind the desk and said quotthe only phone we have is this one  It was dropped off  minutes before your friend asked quot we were so upset with our stay that we actually left hotels  since we were only there for two hours we managed to get a full refund  I dont know if we just went on a bad day or what but we wouldnt stay again  In fact we stayed at another hotel and they were so disgusted with the service we told them about they gave us a suite at the Bonaventures price for a basic room  
P => Great choice for Montreal stay Loved the serenity of the roof top garden  It was lush with foliage and had some seating arrangements along the walk  The large size pool and pool area were lovely  The room was very nice spacious newly furnished  The tapas bar and restaurant wasvery good and was opened until  Saturday night  Apparently the new chef was from Portugal  The hotel is conveniently located  Its downtown and across the street from the Amtrak station Buffet breakfast was done nicely good pastries etc  Small sets of stairs without ramps between various levels of the hotel could be a problem for some people  We would gladly stay here again    
P => Great stay in heart of Montreal The Hilton Montreal Bonaventure is a great location in the downtown with quick acceess to the Metro  While the rooms are a bit dated the property in interesting and clean  The pool is amazingThe concierge was quite knowledgeable and helped us find a great brew pub Dieu du Ciel as well as several wonderful restaurants  
P => If you dont like noises dont come to this hotel  We stayed at the hotel for  nights this past weekend  We were first given a room right by the staircase so we went and exchanged for another room which again was near another staircase  Lots of noises of people talking on their cell phone late at night and cleaning ladies chatting loud during the day  We just gave up on exchanging for rooms figuring it is probably the same everywhere  We found  spiders in our room  There was a spider web in the bathroom  The bed was a bit too soft for our taste and will not work for anyone with back problems  The location is ok  Its right in the downtown financial district  The neighbourhood was pretty dead when we were there  But for the price we paid it is not bad  We will not go back to this hotel however  
P => Fantastic from Arrival to Departure Stayed in a luxurious  bedroom suite with living room and piano Cant beat the value for entertaining our friends while in the Montreal area  Staff were friendly and efficient and very accommodating  Being a hotel manager myself I tend to be very critical I found the room to be very clean and well maintained  A great big THANK YOU to the managment for the upgrade I will definately recommend your hotel to my collegues  
P => A city centre Hilton hotel   you know what to expect We arrived in Montreal by train and the hotel is located directly across the road from the rail station  It is also only a couple of minutes walk to the nearest Metro station and the Hotel is connected directly to the quotRESquot underground network of metro stations shops restaurants etc  Indeed we found that getting to our destination across Montreal by this network of tunnels far more interesting that above groundCheck in was a straightforward and painless process and the staff were friendly The room itself was perfectly standard Hilton fare although the  packet of nuts and  bottle of water provided in the room was unsuitable when travelling with young kids who have not quite grasped the concept of hotel prices  It would have been preferable for these items to be kept in the minibar instead of on the table  The odd dial and button in the bathroom was loose but otherwise perfectly clean and well equipped We didnt sample any food in the hotel over our  day stay preferring instead to explore the city and eat wherever we happened to be when we felt hungry or alternatively at the food court in the underground network just beneath the hotel The swimming pool was excellent   heated to  degress celsius and perfect for a pre breakfast or late night dip  It got busy from around am and sunbeds are at a premium so suggest arriving around am if you intend to snooze the day away in the sunshine Would we come back Well there was nothing wrong with the hotel but I do think that we would try another hotel in downtown Montreal if we were to return  It didnt quite seem to have the more relaxed atmosphere of a Radisson for example  
P => Terrific hotel great location great service We stayed four nights via Priceline and were really pleased  We had a problem with our first room in that it was either near an elevator shaft or pipes and there was a hum that would wake us up  After stating our problem we were moved to a different room and they compd our parking Yes the layout is a little strange but certainly not offputting  The room was very large and nicely furnished and the reception area pool gym and bar were first rate  We were short walking distance from both downtown and the old city  All of the hotel staff with whom we interacted where courteous and knowledgeable  We would stay here again for sure  
P => The Hotel is Just okay  First of allthey gave us THE worst room in the place when we checked in right by the elevator shaft Immediately went to reception and complained got a quieter room  The place is a maize hard to navigate  If you have mobility problems dont stay here  The room only had  glasses  What gives with that Business center computer is expensive and SLOW  We also were HHonors members and they did not give us a paper  Staff was a just a bit pretentious IMO  I would rather have stayed in quotoldquot Montreal  
P => Almost perfect practically in the clouds serene and peaceful Hotel is the top two stories of a block sized downtown office building with a private elevator with a convention space directly beneath  Lobbys in the middle rooms are split level around the perimeter with four courtyards  Two patio barrestaurants between the rooms and lobby form two courtyards a spectacular outdoor pool in the third courtyard and a serene rooftop garden in the fourth  Gardens are plentiful this is truly a unique space of peace in a busy city  Enter  Rue De la Gaucheti re Ouest Montreal QC Canada in Google Earth and youll see the driveway entrance pool and gardens for yourself  Garage is underground Waterfalls and fountains are everywhere even in the pool which is open year round with a small indoor entry  Pool was very comfortably warm and did not smell of chlorine surrounded by lilies flowers and mature trees Study any fire exit graphic and youll quickly get the layout  Yes you must go up or down a  flight of very shallow stairs to get to any room so baby strollers could be a challenge  If you go anywhere in Montreal youll climb many stairs and do a lot of walking  Let the porter handle your luggage Prices in Montreal are high for everything a tourist would want  There are cheap places the locals go to eat but dont bother unless youre on a tight budget  Or go to Beijing in Chinatown for a very good affordable meal  Get restaurant recommendations from Chantal at the Concierge desk   she never steered us wrong  Gibbys in Old Montreal Vertige nearly everything we ate was really fabulous with presentation and service and prices beyond compare  But avoid Coras  block walk for breakfast unless you want a dull comparatively inexpensive but impressive looking meal I found that the day fee for in room wired or wireless Internet access generated more than quite a few very casually dressed folks in the lobby area which has unlimited free wi fi  I tried every trick I know to get a free signal in my room no luck  This  be de rigeur for Montreal but it looks ridiculous to business travellers who made a few comments about it in the lobby  Every hotel in any town has free in room wi fi but not this one  I hope they fix this issue Staff was very courteous and professional very stylishly dressed bilingual  Room was completely quiet unless you get a crying baby in the adjoining room Self parking was day but no in amp out  If you want to use your car its day for valet parking to come and go as you like  This is not uncommon for downtown hotels Bed was very comfortable with a comforter between two sheets    very nice  Bring your own pillow if you can    these are pretty tall Room was nice roomy clean well appointed  Nice closet dresser TV electric outlets bathroom  Every room has a view of a courtyard or the skyline  Mini bar means theres no refrigerator for you to use  Roomy deskwork area with a nice office chair  Minor maintenance issues but that seems to be pretty normal for hotels    you need to tell someone if you want stuff fixed  Fitness center with the usual machines is huge and unused additional room with yoga mats amp pilates lockers more About  block walk to Chinatown  blocks to Old Montreal  Metro subway station in the basement so you could get anywhere in town without a car subway trains coordinate with bus routes  Train station across the street for out of town travel  Two blocks from freeway exit but a GPS will come in VERY handy if you wish to drive in this town  Lots of one way streets and all the signs are in French  The only printed English we saw was in the hotel and most not all of the menus Local drivers are pretty aggressive for tailgating yet incredibly courteous for turns  Gridlock is common  Cabs are good for local transportation  You can rent a bike for day from an automated BIXI kiosk nearby theyre all over town but you might struggle to find an empty slot if you return it late at night or bike with a group Very nice hotel    Id stay here again but its pricey night for conventions  for ordinary folks plus tax tips parking wi fi etc   Prices are high for everything in this town but its beautiful and the food is off the charts  Id come back here just for the restaurants nearby  
P => Good stay great location Very good location I arrived Montreal by train and got to the hotel from underground passage in under  min  Nice lobby comfy bed and wonderful pool  The reception people are a bit distant feeling but other service staff were great  Only the hallways looks dated  Recommend to walk around the underground area it leads right to the major shopping stree of St  Catherine which is great when its raining out and only takes about  min  
P => I keep coming back I have stayed in this hotel many times now both for business and pleasure and I keep coming back  The hotel is located above Place Bonaventure accessible from an elevator from the street level with rooms located on the upper two floors of the building  It is exceptionally convienient to those driving into Montreal from the south and has direct and easy access to both the Montreal subway lines and VIA trains Canadian rail system the train station is directly across from the hotel and accessible at the street level or through the Underground  This ready access to transportation in out and around Montreal is a key advantage of the hotel  Some folks find the inside of the hotel difficult to navigate but its never been a big problem for me  The rooms are mostly on the periphery of the upper two floors of the building and surround a very nice outdoor pool that is heated and isolated from the winds  The pool is even accessbile from inside the hotel so it is usable in the winter time without exposing more than ones neck and head to the cold  I was skeptical the first time I did this in winter with snow on the ground around the pool but it works well  The rooms Ive had were all large functional comfortable quiet and clean with good work areas and comfortable beds but not particularly exciting otherwise  The room I had for my most recent stay  had some issues  The seal between the layers of the thermopane window had failed resulting in a window that was full of moisture and didnt provide much view  The tubshower was a bit worn looking and if you didnt use it early in the morning the water wasnt very hot  The hotel restaurant has an excellent buffet breakfast  The hotel staff is friendly and helpful  Im certain I will stay here again  
P => Great Rooftop Pool Very Nice hotel with great setting it is like you are in a garden  That being said the one downfall was the fact that there are stairs everywhere up  down  up  and with luggage not fun  Very nice atmosphere and handy location         
P => Stairs everywhere  Place is like a maze  Youd need to be an athletic rat Pricey  Rooms were lovely if ac worked which it didnt  Very very pricey Took forever and a day to get hot water in my shower  Very very pricey  Pool was nice gardens were nice  Very very pricey  y back is hit or miss at times  There are no elevators to help get between floors and to get to my rom I had to go up and then go down and then go around  Fine if I needed a workout but I didnt  Very very pricey  It gave my luggage a run for its money   Very very pricey  Internet cost   a minute  Very very pricey  I cant imagine wat room serice would cost  Very very pricey  Appeared to have a lot of rich Middle Eastern like folks 
P => Pretty good hotel I stayed at the hilton Montreal Bonaventure  I cant say that the design of the hotel is great  Kind of a maze actually  Nice grounds considering youre on top of a concrete building  Very nice pool area    Drinks are outrageously priced A corona will cost you     Nice accomodation with one King size bed and a pull out couch  The bathroom could be a bit bigger  Overall Clean and convinient downtown hotel  
P => Large older hotel with nice reation and good service This is a maze of a s concrete structure    a super weird floor plan at this place that still confuses and confounds me  but once you start to figure it out you realize that in spite of the large ungainliness of the place all of the elements are there very friendly and professional service a nice pool and fitness center convenientcentral restaurant and bar and nice newly reated guestrooms that are nice and functional Not a quaint romantic place but it does gets the job done fairly nicely  
P => Welcome to the Labyrinth of the Bonaventure    We had some rather high expectations when we booked the Hilton Bonaventure  Check in was quick and efficient finding our room took a while since the hotel is quite literally laid out as a labyrinth turn down this hallway go down these stairs walk down this hallway which is interesting from an archictectural point of view  Walking down the hallway we saw gardens outside with little cascading waterfalls and a dining patio  The pool looked a bit smaller than the photos make it seem but its not diminutive by any means  The bedroom was very clean and the bed was very comfortable  After setting our stuff down I ided to take a shower  I walked in an ran the water in the tub low and behold the tub water didnt drain  I ided I didnt absolutely need a shower right before we went out for supper so I washed up in the sink then notified the front desk that our tub drain didnt work they asked for our room number and said it would be fixed right away  When we got back about  hours later I ided to try again as they would say in French quotRienquot or nothing  Tub still didnt drain  We phoned the front desk who said that someone would be there shortly  Once again quotRienquot  The next morning we called again and the very apologetic front desk attendee asked if we wanted to switch rooms or if we would like to wait an hour until the repairman arrived  I would have preferred if they had offered us a room the night before but since we were leaving that morning and it was still very early I said Id wait for the repairman  An hour later he called and he said hed come right away which he did  He had no trouble fixing our tub drain and quickly left with no mess  Im not sure what the issue was on the service side of the hotel but it left a rather poor impression on us  Thankfully the valet was very helpful and gave us great directions  I wasnt upset with the hotel as much as I could have been especially if I hadnt gotten a sale price  Had I payed full price I would have been furious  
P => Solid and Generic This is a relatively large hotel but the layout makes it feel very intimate  The location is very convenient to the main train station and the underground with Metro access but not to most of the major tourist destinations  There are few options for food within walking distance unless you count the food court of train station which is good for fast food or coffee  The rooms are generic but comfortable with windows that open  The breakfast buffet in the restaurant is quite good if it is included in your rate andor someone else is footing your bill but i would not pay full price for it  
P => Pleasant but consider the alternatives first The Hilton Bonaventure is an unusual but pleasant hotel in Montreal s downtown business district  It sits on two levels about ten stories high cryptically spread over several penthouse gardens ponds and a large outdoor pool  When you arrive in a narrow and a rather unwelcoming alcove of a foyer at street level where the signage isn t exactly clear there s an elevator up to the main reception  At this point there are no more elevators all the rooms spread out on hallways like wheel spokes from the central reception and bar  It s somewhat disorienting but also a refreshing change from the standard downtown skyscrapers  And although it s all on two split levels don t let that eive you this is a  room Hilton that can accommodate major conferences at street level and over the four days I was there was very very busy  Built for Expo  the architecture and design has the bones of a mid century modern Wallpaper magazine gem  Unfortunately those bones have been much modified in various attempts at updating and modernization so the feel of the interior spaces are rather charmless and haphazard and often  hotel generic   My room was a basic king spacious clean very comfortable bed good LG flat screen nice working area reading area good lighting and roomy closet  No complaints on the layout  The bathroom however was  small no  small the shower a let down a half ent hand held with so so pressure but in a little tub with absolutely nowhere to put sundries  However a well placed and well lit shaving mirror was a pleasant thought given how hard it is to shave in hotel rooms with dim lighting and distant mirrors or desk level make up mirrors in other words the norm  The hotel sits quite far east on the border of old Montreal and a few blocks from busy St Catherine s so a good spot for tourists but a bit of a slog if you want to get out of the touristy areas and hang in the more interesting urban neighbourhoods  Staff at all levels were exceptionally pleasant housekeeping was efficient and always said hello desk staff helpful door staff prompt and the concierge desk was always quick courteous and offered us very nice dining suggestions  The hotel restaurant has a wonderful open k bordering a pond with a small waterfall and khoi very appealing on a sunny morning but no culinary destination given the diversity and volume of epicurean delights in Montreal eating here is like penance  I really liked the quiet relaxing interior open spaces by the pool and at the restaurant the interior views of the plants and ponds  But I didn t like the irritating green blinking light of the smoke alarm the fact that the blackout blinds were half an inch too short and thus the room was flooded with light at the crack of dawn the efficient but very noisy AC the small bathroom the coarse toilet paper and the fact that you get invoiced for phone calls even if it s voice mail or a five ring no answer left call At this level of service it would have been pleasant to wake up to a newspaper at the door but no such luck  Although I had a great stay and slept well given the Hilton online price point which hovers much higher than many other central hotels I would be inclined to try another venue next time round  
P => Great outdoor pool I stayed at the Hilton Bonaventure while attending a conference that was held at the same hotel  I found the hotel to be quite good The hotel is built above a building but you feel like youre at ground level  It has been quite well architected to create this illusion  The outdoor swimming pool is heated and quite enjoyable even in winter Hotel conference facilities are good and wireless internet is available throughout the lobby and meeting areas  Rooms have wired internet that is available for a fee The hotel is based in downtown Montreal and is close to shopping cinemas restaurants and clubs  The bonaventure train station is below the hotel so you can get to it without exiting the building  Montreals underground city also passes through this hotel  
P => Great location great staff enjoyable stay  The location of the hotel was extremely convenient   especially if using the Gare Centrale  Also directly linked to the Metro  The staff were all extremely friendly helpful and courteous at all times  The food was also extremely well presented and tasted delicious  Try the Nachos The only negative would be that the room was a little too dark  However this seems to be common in many hotels  
P => great stay I spent nine nights recently and was very pleased in every aspect  The room service was excellent  The staff especially in the executive breakfast lounge were professional efficient and very polite  The room was spacious and well appointed  The fitness room was clean and well equipped  The pool was warm it was cold out and very attractive  It did close rather early though  The bar closed VERY early by any standard especially so for Montreal  The hotel location is perfect for a business or vacation stay  Close to excellent shopping  The meeting rooms were spacious and well ventilated  I did not hear one complaint from anyone at the hotel  
P => Not a  Star Hotel The GoodThe linens and bed were nice and the hotel is in an easy location to get around near the metro and walking distance to old port but thats about it The BadHorrible views dated lobby and noisy musty rooms that were permeated with the smell of chlorine from the pool  If youre going to stay in Montreal try something else  Dont waste your money here  If you want a hotel of this caliber  star you can get it a lot cheaper elsewhere if you want a  star hotel in Montreal try something else  
P => Average  star hotel  I stayed there one night with  other friends for my th birthday The hotel is located on the top floors of the building wich in pretty unsual  The lobby is not you will usually see in hotel hotels  The outside pool is one of the highlights  It probably is one of the best in Montreal  The souther Side however offer a very bad view  highways train lines etc  Overall very nice hotel  Very reasonable price for what if offers  
P => Give Montreal a chance Look elswhere    As a frequent visitor to Montreal this review is based on comparisons to other downtown hotels  The location of Bonaventure is great for the location to Old Port Downtown and China Town  Self Park below hotel at   is reasonable  The low rating I have given this hotel is the room itself  When this hotel was built in  for the Expo a small sized quotshoe boxquot shaped room was probably OK  I have read that airlines move seats together to accomodate more passengers  so it is that walls in this hotel were compacted to squeeze in more guests The Newly reated or Just horrific Tan on bland with oon and quotgray matterquot chenille  An Ergonomic chair that gave my son nightes  I think Hannibal Lector  have actually designed this chair see photos on website  Business type furnishings were much to large and unappealing for the size of the room  Wires showing behind every piece of furniture blue and white behind the desk a jumble of black wires behind the TV Internet  per daySheets were nice and new but not tucked in  So everything came loose   Bathroom was about the size of what you might expect on a cruise ship Inroom coffee at   per pod cup no complimentary coffee anywhere in the morning  Small window with horse blanket type coverings that it was very dark all day Pool was interesting and deep  over  feet in most parts  The pool attendents were a bit unfriendly  I actually have never given a review so low  The two points I gave were for the staff who all seemed OK Montreal is such an historic and beautiful city please be advised to check out other hotels  
P => Newly reated downtown hotel with attractive courtyard garden I base my rating for this property partly on the great rate we got it for about  USD  Had I paid  for this hotel as some have the minor irritations we encountered would have been likely magnified in my view  LocationThis hotel is in downtown Montreal and easily connected to the underground city  The actual rooms are on the highest floors of an ugly office building and so you first enter a small foyer area with an elevator that then takes you to the actual hotel lobby on the top floor  I did not like walking around this area of Montreal at night  Very dead and almost ominous  I don t consider this an ideal location for Montreal but certainly convenient enough Lobby and public areasThe hotel layout is quite atypical with something approaching a courtyard garden wpool around which many rooms are situated  The plants and foliage in the garden were delightful and it was pleasant to walk about in the public areas of the hotel with a view of this garden  The lobby general seating areas were also orated nicely and pleasant to be in  I found the variety of artwork in the public areas quite interesting  My only complaint was that the hallway carpets in pretty much any part of the hotel were disingly filthy to the point of distraction  Perhaps these were not reated yet  But in addition to all the permanent staining and wear no end of food trays towels and messes would show up in the hallways constantly  The staff didn t seem to care at all about attending to hallways  Rooms and bathroomsThe room we stayed in was clean newly reated with very nice furnishings but an odd shape  We did have a nice flat screen TV but the oddly shaped long corner courtyard room given to us resulted in the TV being at quite a distance from the bed none of the tripadvisor photos posted by other travelers reflect the odd L shaped room we had  In general all the furniture placement was very strange in this room with the bed in an quotalcovequot and the desk dresser and TV awkwardly fitted closer to the other portion of the L shape  The room had all standard modern amenities  The bed was extremely comfortable with very nice comforters  Bathrooms were extremely nice   with high quality material used for reations  Our room was facing the edge of the garden but all light was blocked   partly because the plants covered most of the window area and also because the part of the window not covered would have resulted in the folks at the pool area having full view of us in the room  Altogether I wish we had been given a different room location preferably NOT facing the courtyard   but they were sold out by the time we checked in  In fact we had requested two beds and I was irritated when we were given a room with a single queen  We had to live with a rollaway they provided InternetIt was disappointing that no free internet was provided  
P => Id go back The place is buried in a downtown building you would never know it was there but once you find it you will be happy you did  be they could do with a bigger sign Your downtown so you will be paying for your parking if you drove its underground Once your settled its quite nice the hallways are a bit long and tunneling and the maid staff leave an awful lot of quotstuffquot laying around Check in staff doormen and the information desk are very friendly and informative they have maps of the city and can suggest many places to visit shop and dine The highlight of this place is the rooftop outdoor experience you would never know you were downtown once you sit back and enjoy the sunshine as you have breakfast on the outdoor patio with the stream filled with fish running along the side  The heated outdoor pool is also unique and very refreshing well laid out with lounge chairs and pool bar  Great for an afternoon of sun If your considering this place get something with meal coupons you will save yourself some money  If your eating breakfast at the buffet and you see waffles or pancakes get them dont wait for your next plate at the buffet they go fast For a downtown hotel I was disapointed they didnt have wireless internet running through the building  
P => St downtown hotel I stayed at this location for a conference in early ober   Location of the hotel is great right in the centre of Montreal downtown and I found it very convenient to be able to get to the Station via the underground city without going outside as it was raining when I left The building is really ugly and the layout is bad with a long walk to get everywhere However those are the negatives on the plus side the accommodation was great  The room was furnished to a high standard theres not much of a view to speak of as its a low rise hotel but the facilities within the hotel were good including the pool and gym  Staff were friendly and helpful  
P => Great stay at the Hilton Bonaventure We arrived by train from Quebec  The Hilton Bonaventure is directly situated outside the Train station  However with the wonderful underground network available in Montreal we could have remained in the station and arrived at the Hilton Bonaventure  At the time we arrived strike action was beginning in many hotels at this time in Ontario  However we were not affected by this strike  The staff and management in the Restaurant were excellent and in any Hilton we have stayed we have come to realise that it is standard treatment   One to be highly recommended  Well done The manners and etiquette are to be commended  The variety at breakfast was excellent and probably the best we have encountered anywhere  Would we stay here again Yes Old town Montreal is very interesting  Restaurants are really good and Italian food in particular is really good  The pool on the rooftop of the hotel provided a haven from the busy city everyday  Would definitely recommend this Hotel  
P => FANTASTIC The hotel is beautiful I loved that the lobby is on the th floor  The location of the hotel is near all the shops that line rue Sainte Catherine  Its about a  minute walk to China Town and Old Montreal and a  minute walk to the gay village This hotel is perfect 
P => Stayed here yearly for over  years My wife and I have stayed here every year for  years at different times of the year t amp eWe love e because the Botanical Gardens are in full bloom The hotel was reated a few years ago and is very nice and comfortable  The rooms are large fitting  queen beds and chair and desk  Bathroom is average size Room has a flat screen tv mini barexpensive never useand if you get the garden view which I think is the nicest is very relaxing  The hotel has a very nice restaurant superb food when its open which it hasnt the last  years out of  that we wentNevertheless there are enough great restaurants in Montreal  I have never had a bad meal in  years  Two favorites quotBonaparte amp Europeaquot the latter we discovered this year and ranks the finest restaurant we have ever eaten at in Montreal Now the negatives parking is very expensive  cnd plus about   tax  This is valet parking so expect to shell out   in tips everytime you need your car  Dont ever try to save the  by parking yourself youll never find your car in that labrinth The Canadian dollar was at par with US  when we went and something new  You cant claim your Federal tax credit at the border ITquotS GONE THIS YEAR  Over the years we have had very good exchange rates as high as   CND against  US  Thats changed and although I was able to snag a  CND room this e  They have too many kakamani events in this town that for some reason that I cant understand draws big crowds here to this hotel that their rates run anywhere from   CND   tax The hotel is very convenient to Place Villa ie and underground shopping across the street  Also is less than mins to St Catherine St downtown  We have stayed here so many times that my wife wants to stay whenever we can  I have stayed at Best Western and the now Gouvernes not sure I spelt that right its across the street on University St with the revolving dining room One other thing people dress up in Montreal and certainly at the Bonaventure so if you dont want to stand out dont wear jeans or shorts to dinner  A sports coat without tie is fine women know how to dress to dinner no suggestions there 
P => Enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Montreal Bonaventure The hotel is in the heart of downtown Montreal Canada  The staff was very warm and provided exceptional service  I believe the property was originally condo units which were bought by private investors and converted to a Hilton  They did a very nice job reconditioning the property  The guest rooms were very comfortable and the heated pool and the landscaped garden provided for a very relaxing environment  We happened to be in Montreal during the  Jazz Festival and it was awesome I would highly recommend visiting Montreal for the festival and encourage visitors to stay at the Hilton Bonaventure if you have the opportunity  Please see pictures we took of the property  My only complaint would have been with the toilet in our bathroom which ran continuously  
P => Simply Amazing Ive always wanted to stay here attracted by the photos of the rooftop gardens  The Hilton Bonaventure did not disappoint  Our room was a luxurious retreat as we watched the fireworks in the evening sky on the last evening of our honeymoon  Fortunately we got a good price  CDN  Great location for shopping dining just walking around The mid century modernist architecture with rooftop fountains streams and trees was fascinating  Were still trying to figure out how they can have such tall trees there  Simply amazing The manager Christine and frontdesk were very accomodating and pleasant  Also the full breakfast there was incomparable 
P => Nice hotel especially the pool As most of the other reviews have mentioned this is quite a unique hotel as it is on the top three floors of one of the ugliest s concrete office blocks youll ever see but the hotel is great once you get past the initial shock of the exterior  The location is great as it is right over the road from the main train station and walking distance to the shops and restuarants The rooms were a good size and were very clean  The roof garden and swimming pool are amazing   Id love to go back in the middle of winter to try the heated outdoor pool when there is several feet of snow all aroundThe bar was lovely and we had a snack one evening that was also very nice   although you pay Hilton prices for the food and drink Overall a great hotel that Id visit again  
P => Great Value for moneuy This hotel has a great location as its directly above the underground Metro  All the sitesboroughs are easily accessible from the location  Also the quotunderground cityquot with cafes shops and restaurants is nearby  My TV had a terrible connection but I wasnt there to watch TV  A great stay and value for money  
P => Unique Hilton Property Excellent hotel perched on an office building  Wonderful pool for children large rooms and excellent service  One of hiltons more unique hotels  
P => RELAXATION PLUS AT THE BONAVENTURE We stayed at Bonaventure twice in y   the second time because we couldnt wait to go back there   The gardens are relaxing and enchanting   the rooftop are is drawn down from the mountains to the North   therefore is very clear  and filled with positive energy   The art work is noteworthy   there are many enticing sitting areas   With the upgrade to the executive level   the lounge access makes it very easy to not want to leave the hotel   The breakfast in the lounge is small   but excellent   the pastries are made by the pastry chef and are definetly worth eating too many of   Fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh fruit salad are eye  openers The pool is of a generous size and the waterfall apparatus there affords a relaxing sound   even the music around the hotel is inoffensive   and somehow relaxing   The view from room  was great with a city skyline and an old cathedral both in sight   Cant wait to go back 
P => Worth Every Penny My friend and I booked this hotel through travelzoo since we got an amazing deal   incl  tax for a room with  queen beds  We were a little skeptical of the hotel  especially since we rolled up to the hotel and it looked a little run down  As we entered we found out that the Hilton had an entire level  and the subway station is below the building  which is very very convenient  Our room was very clean very modern and to our surprise  looked exactly like the pictures on the hotel website  The location of the hotel couldnt be any better it is located   blocks away from rue catherine where all the action is and if you hop onto the subway  just  or  stops away from Old Montreal  Staff was friendly  no issues with them  Overall  a wonderful stay  
P => Above the hustle bustle Located on the top  floors of Place Bonaventure it is also above a Metro station and across the street from the VIA rail station with access to the amazing Underground to extends throughout much of downtown  Yet the green courtyards are cozy oases above the traffic below  With rooms arranged around the perimeter of the building and the receptiondining areas in the core the hotel uses only two levels for all the rooms Front desk staff are very friendly and check in went smoothly  Room was available at pm so no need to check bags  Rooms are large clean comfortable and quiet  There are no vending machines for when the gift shop is closed instead you are directed to the mini bar in your room and theres no bargains there of course The location is good being blocks from Bell Centre hockey arena to SW and  mi to Place dArmes and Notre Dame basilica to NE  McGill Univ  is about  mi to NW  
P => Excellent oasis in the city Wonderful quality hotel  The garden and pool are a great escape from the city below  The room was clean comfortable and tastefully reated   very modern yet so comfy  The staff was very helpful and the location of the hotel is perfect for every sight in Montreal  
P => Great business class hotel I ve stayed at the Hilton once before and this was just as satisfactory  It s a typical business class hotel and I really enjoyed the swimming pool when I was there on a hot sunny weekend  Also worthy of an applause is the spacious gym with new Precor machines and very new cardio machines each with their own TV and audio  
P => Nice Stay    My husband and I went to Montreal for business as well as a quick romantic getaway  Well the hotel was nice    The set up just as everyone said is very interesting  I didnt personally like the set up I mean on Saturday morning when waiting to go to the main floor we had to wait for a second round with the elevators because there were so many people trying to get on the elevator  They need to definitely work to improve that  The room was GREAT We stayed in one of the reated rooms the housekeeping did a great job at keeping our room nice every day  We did order room service one day after a night at the Montreal Jazz Fest and the food was really good   very filling   The staff was nice especially at the Concierge desk always extremely helpful  We went during a great weekend because the Jazz Festival and a Carribean parade were going on so it made for great fun  The hotel is very close to all the shopping on St Catherines the Underground City shopping is ok  It was a bit too stuffy for us I guess since it is summer  The pool area was nice and very chic  We went into Old Montreal and had some great eats and the cab was only about   The next day we went back for breakfast in Old Montreal and walked and it was a brief  min walk  All in all it was a great romantic stay   
P => Strange layout  We stayed at this hotel for  nights for a conference  As other reviewers have stated the hotel is oddly configured  It is on the top  floors of an office building  When you get out of the elevator you are staring down a hallway of rooms and have to make a right to get to the lobby  If you follow the signs for the pool you  end up walking around the entire perimeter of the hotel  Sometimes it is faster to cut through the lobby but I guess they want to keep soggy guests from dripping through the reception area  The hotel is not very kid friendly  The lifeguard during the afternoons was a little quotcrabbyquot to say the least running out of the sign in area yes you have to sign in and out when entering the pool area whenever a child even raised hisher voice reminding us every few minutes to keep the kids on one side of the rope etc  He was sort of standing at the edge of the pool and staring at one father whose young child was screaming a bit until the poor guy got out of the pool with his other kids and left  It was a little weird  You do get towels when you sign in so at least there is no need to bring them from the room  Housekeeping is very nice and responds quickly if you need extra towels  However on the last night there was some kind of party going on and they never brought coffee for the coffee maker which I had requested  I was told this was not housekeeping and the minibar lady would bring it but she never came  The underground city and the Metro are right under the hotel it can be a little confusing but we figured it out  Also be warned that many people outside the hotel speak limited if any English  One of the reasons we went to Montreal was because my dhter is in an international school and wanted to practice her French  I speak a little but mostly I had to depend on her to translate  It was pathetic  The buffet breakfast is overpriced  for adults  for children  The  kids hardly ate anything cheerios toast definitely not  worth  You can get Pizza Hut delivered to your room through room service limited menu and there are the underground food places Subway etc  Also you HAVE to pay for parking and cannot leave your car in front to unload luggage and check in  If you need a luggage cart the bell staff have to take your luggage  My husband had a large tote bag with his binoculars on top we had stopped at Niagara falls on the way to Montreal which he gave to the bellman and after we got home we realized that we no longer had the binoculars  Incidentally he forgot to tip the bellman at the door of the hotel before he went to park the car  I tipped the man who brought the luggage to the room but it was a different person  I didnt know my husband had put his binoculars on top of the tote bag so I didnt realize anything was missing  We dont know for sure be they fell out somewhere but I think the moral is as I told my husband Dont forget to tip at the Hilton Bonaventure Overall it was an OK hotel but I dont think I would stay there again  We stayed there only because the conference was there  
P => Great Beds Important info about parking Loved the penthouse style of the hotel gardens are gorgeous  Ignore peoples complaints about the concrete walls its not as bad as it sounds I think it was an artistic choice some people like it some dont  The lack of elevators once inside the hotel isnt an issue that bothered me as its not much of walk to any of the rooms  The entrance to the hotel via elevator from place bonaventure has a great upket feel to it  The reception staff were very friendly and efficient and we were offered concierge service  The room itself was wonderful amazingly comfortable bed Spacious room and nicely laid out  We avoided the mini bar although it was very well stocked  Fiji water bottle  Ice machines can require a little hunting despite signs  dont be afraid to go behind closed doors Short walk to St  Catherine and Crecent st  Now here is a warning about the parking Fairly good value especially when compared to surrounding hotels  However be warned the ceilings are very low and a mass of pipes covers them bringing the the height limit to ft We drove a truck in and as we went down each level the radio antenna scraped the ceiling  Very tense ent but once parked it is a very safe standard garage  Pictures attached  doesnt quite do it justiceOverall great hotel would stay there again and again  
P => Great hotel I liked staying in this hotel a lot  I booked it through priceline for a ridiculously low price  The location is very convenient   its right across the street from the main train station and subway  It is in the business district so dont expect any neighborhood conveniences and liveliness on the streets after  p m  The building   huge officeexhibition center of which the hotel occupies the top two floors is probably the ugliest Ive ever seen  The interior design is also s vintage with exposed concrete and wooden panels but looks classier The hotel staff was very professional the room was large clean comfortable and well designed  Free Wi Fi internet works only in the lobby  For wired internet in the room you have to pay extra  There is an outdoor pool in the courtyard on the roof  Restaurant serves overpriced breakfast but you can always get ent bacon and eggs for  from one of the eateries inside the train station  
P => Consistent positive experience throughout serveral stays The Hilton Montreal Bonaventure is a penthouse style hotel occupying the last  flours of an officeretail building Place Bonaventure Over the last few months the hotel has been undergoing moderate reations to rooms and common areas  Although some people prefer to avoid hotels while they are undergoing repairs the staff at the hotel was great as far as taking steps to minimize inconveniences noisedisruptions and was proactive in their communications on this subject   so if you are considering this property dont let this be an issue The heated rooftop pool is probably one of the main attraction of this hotel  I would say that this hotel has mainly a business feel but would also be suitable for tourists looking for a great location although there  be plenty of more affordable alternatives The hotel has a small but modern gym some equipment now featuring small TVs  Room size is moderate and as far as or is concerned I had one of the newer room during my last stay so i would quote it as being modern and somewhat stylish   although nothing too extravagant Front desk staff is quite helpful   so are the executive lounge staff  The lounge itself is fine albeit quite small The hotel is easily accessible from the Via Rail train station accross the streetaccess via underground if raining so it is walking distance to Old Montreal shopping and major businesses Food at Le Crastillon is very good with above average service 
P => Nice Hotel Nice hotel not stellar but nice  Layout was a little strange    there are short landings to get you from floor to floor no elevator and the lobby is on the top floor there is an elevator from the street to this  The room was fine and the pool was nice  It certainly is not the nicest Hilton Ive stayed at aestetically but we had a positive experience there  
P => Proposed to my fiance at this hotel      I stayed here for two nights in y  and proposed to my fiance here  We go to Montreal frequently  The hotel is beautiful and prestigious with a gorgeous courtyard   makes you feel like youre not in the city  Great pool scene on the roof  The rooms were very nice  My problem was that the concierge service ruined my proposal  They left a note which gave it away I trusted them with this info to get the room ready flowers champagne etc  I walk into the room they did a great job but theres this note about how I cant light candles which I planned to because it goes against fire code regulations and having the fire dept  show up would ruin my proposal I mean all they had to do was leave a note saying no candles  To mention the proposal was a very moronic idea since my fiance and I read it together  I called about this and they offered me a free nights stay  Anyways great hotel not sure all the light bulbs are on with the staff   of course who knows what happened with that particular concierge  If you have never been to Montreal I do recommend the hotel for its overall location service and beauty   my experience was ruined just because of this one idiot move  If you are in Montreal you must do these things have a smoked meat sandwhich at Schwarts on St  Laurent Blvd  have a steak at Moishes Gibbys or La Queue de Cheval visit the casino visit the Notre Dame Basicalla amazing beautiful visit the waterfront during the day and take a river cruise that serves breakfast book aheadI try and avoid La Ronde   its not a great amusement park but the Monster is a great rollercoaster  
P => Great downtown hotel My wife and I spent the weekend at this hotel on one of their specials  It is still being reated although this should not be apparent  Room was very nice the bed and bedding was superior  I love to courtyard aspect to this rooftop hotel als the swimming pool is a unique experience  This is probaly my th stay at this hotel since  I have had some issues with the front desk in the past none on this visit  The hotel is connected to the underground city which is perfect for those inclined to go shopping  We went to the hockey game without having to go outside Highly recommended  
P => Run down and unwelcoming   Not recommended I stayed in this hotel in   and can only recommend for people to stay away from this hotel  This is probably the most run down Hilton Ive ever been to terrible concrete facade outside and on the inside not much better  They are undergoing reations on the top floor so theres constant noise and moving  The interior of the room leaves more to be desired makes an impressoin of  ish interior in dire need of an upgrade reations  In terms of cleanliness it is not bad but they are prettty scrungy even on the complimentary shampoo etc  I noticed that if there was anythilng left   they dont replenish but expect you to re use it I suppose  I have asked for extra tea for the room   never got it  The lounge is also under reations and they dont give out any coupons to compensate for it being closed  They are also not accomodating with any gues coupons bieng extremely cheap  Oh and about the pool   it is nice but also very outdated and is not what you would expect from a Hotel of this level  Ive been to Monreal a number of times and love the city and this is by far my worst experience in any hotel here  Even the Delta is a better choice than the Hilton  Stay away is my best advise    
P => Mediocre hotel I had a mediocre NYE stay at the Hilton  The hotelor is a little dated and the exposed concrete did not give the hotel a welcoming atmosphere  I got a  double bed room on the same floor as reception which is on the top floor of the hotel  I expected a flat screen TV as I saw on the hotel pics but it turned out to be a regular TV  Hilton beds are always good but again the or is a little old  Bathroom was on the small size and I had a small leak in the shower However I got a great rate from Hotwire for NYE wknd s so I shouldnt complain The concierge was amazingly nice and gave great recommendations and was really patient I would probably check out another hotel in Montreal before staying here again  
P => Nice experience overall no problems Other than the gift shop being a little pricey   for a  pill bottle of ibuprofin I enjoyed my limited business related stay here The food was interesting having eaten at the bar restaurant and the main restaurant  The main restaurant offered an excellent multi course meal  The bar restaurant was lower priced offering a nice atmosphere and good food offerings The hotel is over a walkway with shops including a regional coffee shop and a Starbucks Everyone was polite and helpful  The room accommodations were nice overall  
P => Adequate but not fantastic The hotel in centrally located but is a bit run down  You check in on the top floor   very unusual  The halls are dark but the staff is friendly and helpful and the room was large  
P => Highly Recommended The Hilton Bonaventure is an very nice hotel in a great location that is currently being reated and will be even nicer when completed in   We requested a reated room some have already been completed but ended staying in a non reated room because the only newer one available was in the smoking section  Although the room we stayed in was slated for remodeling I was surprised to a find a very nice room that while the furnishings were a little worn was by no means shabby at all  The beds were extremely comfortable and room well kept and clean  Some have mentioned or complained that there are steps to get to your rooms but unless you have a disability it really is a non issue  The steps in question total about  and are of the low and long variety think patio steps and there are ramps to help people with their luggage  I was disappointed that the exercise room was being remodeled due to reopen in tember  and the temporary workout room was not even worth visiting  However from the looks of the drawings the new room will be outstanding  The pool area is very nice and since there was a hot spell while there somewhat crowded  Special mention should be made to the staff who from doorman to the front desk and everyone in between was as nice and helpful as can be  Especially ien the concierge who couldnt have been better  The Bonaventures location interesting because its on top of an office building  Once inside the elevator in few seconds youre inside the hotel  Being so high up you do get the feeling of being in a little oasis out of the hustle and bustle of Montreal  Although you are directly connected to the quotunderground cityquot it is on the edge so its a bit of walk to get to middle of the action but you are right on top of a subway line  As mentioned before the entire hotel is due for a revamp with completion by mid  and from the drawings the hotel will be very very nice  That said I wouldnt hesitate to stay at the Bonaventure again and recommend it highly  
P => Great hotel as long as room not on busy street Returned for another  nights   after  nights last week  Early check in resulted in getting room on busy University St  which turned out quite noisy  After restless night front desk took care of move to quieter room facing the garden for the rest of the stay  Otherwise this is great hotel and spent two afternoons by the very nice pool  
P => A unique hotel well located in Montreal Staying on top of the Bonaventure convention facility seems a little strange but the garden setting is peaceful and serene in the midst of bustling Montreal  Other reviewers mentioned the steps involved to get to rooms  We were in the executive area and there are few steps and they are easy to walk even with luggage  We enjoyed our continental breakfasts and evening refreshments in the executive lounge area  It is well staffed and convienent  The Bonaventure Hiltons location is tops for touring the historic district waterfront area as well as underground shops and restaurants  
P => Fine Location for a stay in Montreal I had a great time in Montreal The hotel was a plus   not a huge plus but definitely not a negative  It is in a fine location with an easy walk to Old Montreal or Downtown shopping or McGill University  The taxis in Montreal are plentiful and inexpensive so going further was no problem  I would rather stay in a small boutique hotel with some charm  The Bonaventure is not that at all  It does have a unique design the gardens and swimming pool on the roof  The gardens are designed for intimate conversation  I am surprised by the review that dings the bellmen  They were the friendliest group Ive ever met Really interested and talkative  I sat in the lobby working on the wireless internet and I noticed one bellman readily engage people in conversation about where to go and how to get there  The whole lobby staff were professional and friendly  The only demur I have is that the room I had was a real hike from the lobby  Also the hotel has only one lobby which you must go through  
P => Great choice all round At the last minute we ided to visit Montreal for the first time  After reading many hotel reviews on this site we were unable to secure two beds apparently not an easy feat in high season on a whim at a few hotels higher on our list so called the Hilton Bonaventure directly  We have had overall good experiences at Hilton previously and we were not disappointed Initially we booked two nights and then added on a third  Due to a delayed flight we arrived into the hotel close to  AM asked for a quiet room and were assigned   It was indeed quiet had terrific beds and was nicely appointed  Shortly after  AM an alarm sounded an announcement was made laring a report was being investigated  This was repeated for about three minutes before we were given an all clear message  It  just have been something like a person smoking in a non smoking room we never heard  This was a first in our hotel experiences but ided we would rather be alarmed than not and what better way to inform the masses There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this property  Every single staff member with whom we interacted whether by phone or in person was courteous friendly helpful and efficient  It turns out that our room was part of a two story suite that was booked on our third night so we were asked to move next door to   It was effortless  Another quiet lovely room with terrific bedsWe did not use the gym or the pool but the outdoor heated pool looked fabulous and we would definitely try that next time  We ordered room service breakfast on our last morning and while it can be an expensive venture the food and service were good and we were willing to pay for the convenience  Directly across the street is the underground shopping malltrain station where absolutely everything you could ever possibly need or want is located  Many food outlets are there as well as a pharmacy shoe shine station shops galore you name it  In fact most everything is quite close to the hotel The consierge desk was always staffed with courteous and knowledgeable individuals who were quite helpful in suggesting how best to see Montreal in just a few days  Plenty of brochures available there as well The first day we chose the  hour Gray Line city tour to acclimiate us to the area  We had a terrific driver John and thoroughly enjoyed this experience  He recommended the sound and light show at Notre Dame Basillica which we viewed the next night  Definitely an interesting experience  He also spoke of Gibbys a wonderful restaurant in Old Montreal with quite a bit of history  We splurged on that fine dining experience and were not disappointed  Reservations are recommended dress is casual service is excellent and food is terrific  One can order anything from vegetarian to fish chicken and meat and prices range from about   on up depending  This includes salad bread and two sides Another reviewer mentioned Eggspectations restaurant for breakfast which we tried  Good food and plenty of it good service and good prices too  Breakfast is served all day and lunch too until  PM A reviewer mentioned the elevator situation at the Hilton  This was NOT a problem  We were advised that the lobby is actually on the th floor and all rooms are just steps away from the lobby making an elevator unnessary  We would agree  From the street there are approximately ten steps to the elevator and there is one button only to push lobby  We found this to be far more expedient than standing around waiting for elevators to hit every floor before reaching us  Our room was reachable in about two minutes taking  shallow steps and walking down two corridors  Definitely not a problem unless one is impaired or is carrying too much luggage for comfort  While the lobby and corridors appear a tad shabby there is a huge sign in the lobby announcing that millions are being spent in complete reations including all bedrooms to be finished in spring   Both of our rooms appeared to have new or The locals complained of the heat and humidity which is not normal for them  We did find it hot but we are used to hot in Texas  It is a terrific city with lots to see and do good food and lots of shopping too  Our Hilton experience was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in Montreal  The people of this city are definitely its best asset 
P => A Fantastic Place to Stay Being my very first time to Montreal I did not know what to expect Especially with our accomadations I was very impressed with the Hilton Bonaventure  They treated us very VERY WELL  I know that you cant please everyone but they did their very best on making sure that we were well taken care of  My husband was out there on a business trip and I went along for a vacation of my own expensed out of our own pockets of course  However I found the staff extremely friendly and the hotel was very clean  I even chatted with the maids the doormen etc    Everyone was so helpful  The service and the smiles I had received from the staff had made our stay that much more pleasurable  We had even found the Bartenders in the Lounge had a great sense of humour and were very friendly to talk to  I would recommend staying there to anyone who travels to Montreal and would love a touch of elegance added to their stay  Another thing I had found is that it is so close to everything  I loved the fact that the Underground shopping was just across the street and that walking to Old Montreal was only  minutes away  However I would also recommend you wear very COMFORTABLE SHOES for walking  I just love Montreal  The prices on clothing and shoes is Fantastic too Now that I am home again in Vancouver B C  I find myself daydreaming of the day that I will be able to return to Montreal and stay again in the Hilton Bonaventure  Thank you to all the staff for making my trip to Montreal a very memorable one  Merci from The Benoits 
P => Wierd Hilton We stayed here because of its location reletive to the Bell Centre  The hotel is very convinientlly located and is conected directly to reso very good in   The hotel is outdated there is no elevators to rooms and they heat the outdoor pool in   The valets were helpfull but skip the bellmen they were rude and franklly useless  I dealt with  or more of them and I kept geting sent to the front desk or doorman for information  This dispite a   tip for carrying  bags  If location is no issue for you hiltons other hotel the Doubletree is WAY better fro the money  
P => Fantastic hotel This is a great hotel  From the moment we arrived service was outstanding  We were greeted at the entrance by friendly staff and the front desk staff was great as well  Our room was very clean and modern  The plasma TV was a nice touch and we actually enjoyed relaxing in the room because of the great layout and furnishings  The bathroom was nice with plenty of counterspace and nice Crabtree amp Evelyn toiletries  We paid a little bit more for a room on the quotexecutive floorquot  it was only  extra which included free internet breakfast and afternoon snacks  Well worth the extra cost  The free breakfast was nice  Charming presentation and very nice staff who even gave us tips on what sites to see that day  The evening snacksdrinks were nice as well but be warned you are charged for the drinks  We were under the impression that it was complemantary so were shocked when we got a bill for our two glasses of wine  It was OK since the wine was good but was still a bit of a surprise they had a sign on the bar but we did not notice it  The desk staff was extremely nice in fact everyone we encountered in Montreal was very very nice and was helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations  When we exchanged currency they took that extra step to explain each piece of currency The hotel is located in the business district downtown and is walking distance to Old Montreal  The Hotel is on the top floor of an office building and is conveniently linked to the underground and the metro station  There is a nice pool and a little river that flows through a rooftop garden complete with ducks and fish  It was nice to look out the window and see ducks float byI would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again  
P => Great Hotel Worth the Hotwire Price We booked this hotel through Hotwire and just completed our stay between  and   Our room was on the first floor and yes its true    there are no elevators between the floors on which rooms located there is an elevator from the main entrance on street level to the lobby the hotel is located on the upper levels of the Place Bonaventure officeshopping plaza    but the way that the hotel is landscaped with lots of trees and gardens and even a duck pond it doesnt at all feel like it is in the middle of downtown Montreal or on top of an office building  Our room was ently sized with a walk in closet  Although the bathroom was a bit small it was beautifully done in ble tile  Overall the hotel and our room was very clean  Although the high speed internet cost   in the hotel room there was free wireless high speed internet access in the lobby areas The staff was also very helpful and friendly    the concierge was especially helpful with restaurant reservations directions and even sold discount tickets to the Jardin BotaniqueInsectariumBiodomeStade Olympique But the best part of the hotel was its location    it is a three minute walk underground no less to the Bonaventure Metro station which is also on the main Orange line  It is a ten minute walk underground or above ground to Vieux Montreal and a five minute walk to downtown Montreals shopping district  It is also a two minute walk to the Quebec tourist information office as well as to the central train station underneath the Fairmont which is also where the airport bus drops off  All in all we could not have been happier with the service cleanliness and location of the hotel  It was a good deal on Hotwire too 
P => Its no HIlton This is not what I was expecting from the Hilton  When I arrived to check in the line was long and it took at least  minutes to complete this process  It was then that I experience the crazy layout of this hotel  There is no elevator once you get to the lobby I had to haul my bags and suitcases up the stairs myself  On the first day I received a note that the phones would be out for a period of time and they recommended using the pay phone in the lobby  Then on the second day the air conditioning died  The staff didnt really want to help  I asked for some directions and was sent no where close to my destination  You can find nicer hotels at a better price  Thats what I did  I checked out and found a new hotel But they do have some nice rooftop gardens and pool  Just go in and check it out then stay somewhere else  
P => Strange Ive just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel the strangest Hilton Ive ever stayed in After arriving in at just after midnight on a Sunday we struggled to find anybody motivated enough to help us with our baggage  Check in was fine but it was a a shock to find that the bar was closed and that room service stopped at midnight The room was above average and the bed was the comfiest that we have ever slept in quite a high accolade considering that we spend at least  weeks of the year in hotels The executive lounge is small but well run and serves a complimentary cold buffet breakfast  We were especially well looked after by Guy and Paul There is an outdoor swimming pool heated and a slightly tired gym room All in all it was an okay stay but it was just a very very odd hotel  Its lay out is strange the atmosphere is strange the bar is uninspiring and uninviting and for a Hilton the public areas were a little shabby  On the up side its ideally placed for sightseeing and shopping with both the downtown shopping areas and Old Montreal being within walking distance either above ground or in the underground pathway system and THE COMFIEST BED EVER 
P => Beware NO elevators There are no elevators and the staff doesnt tell you  I had to drag my bags upstairs and then downstairs  There were no bellmans available when we arrived  It was horrible for US per night  When I asked for a closer room I was given a downgraded room  Ive never stayed at a  star hotel without elevators and no bellmen  Also the drain in the bathtub was very slow  You end up showering in  inches of water  
P => About what you would expect I booked this hotel through Hotwire and got it for  per night excluding taxes  For this price it was an outstanding stay  Especially since they charge you for everything such as internet   CND and parking  CND  However the Hilton Montreal Bonaventure is also a quotlegacy hotelquot where you know everything will be in place  The staff is quite nice the service very good and the condition of the hotel average to nice  The rooms are early s vintage but nicely preserved  The hotel has only two floors but is widely spread out  So overall it is a solid  star hotel  Some of the cons include it being tough to get to as you have to take an elevator to the th or th floor to visit check in  Also there it  take a while to get to your hotel room since it is the size of a city block  The or is ugly concrete from the s or s  The pros include the metro stop underneath the hotel as well as oversized rooms and a comfy bed  Its got the feel of a business hotel more than anything else  
P => Hard to believe you are on top of a building We stayed at the Hilton while visiting our son who goes to school at McGill  We didnt want to go outside and it was important for us to be attached to the underground path system  After reading that the hotel was on top of a building I was sure it would be cold and office like  On the contrary it was warm and surprisingly the landscaping was beautiful  They have a complete garden with full sized trees that wraps around the hotel  The garden was planned to be attractive in the snow too and so although we were on top of a building we had a lovely woodland scene outside our window  The pool is open year round  Getting into the hotel driveway is quite tricky  We drove around the block a couple of times before we figured it out  Its a very sharp turn right at the corner  There is a small elevator lobby and then a full hotel lobby at the top of the elevator  We found the valet concierge and registration desk staff to be helpful and polite  Many have commented on the s architecture and its true that the walls of the public areas are that weird formed cement popular in public buildings  years ago  Everything else we saw was updated with fresh fabric and wood finishes  We stayed in an executive level room which gave us access to the concierge lounge  Our room was tastefully orated in deep wood tones with new carpet and granite tops on the bar and bathroom  The desk is cleverly designed so it can pull out to use as a table for meals or pushed in a bit when used as a desk  We took a picture of it so we can get one in our next house We did find the hotel a bit noisy in the morning but that might have been because there were a lot of children staying there for a dance competition  We like staying in boutique hotels in the Old City because we like to walk a lot but this was a good compromise for a cold winter weekend  We walked for miles in the path system with only light sweaters on and even went to a neighbouring hotel for drinks  
P => Loved it from Brooklyn NY I was a bit nervous after reading prior reviews   I got this hotel via Priceline so I didnt have a choice of where to stay I input that I wanted a star hotel at night  After reading the reviews I called the hotel to request a room on the same level as an elevator  The staff was very accommodating   I was placed on the nd floor the service elevator stopped there  The room was fabulous The king size bed could have fit  people  It was sooooo comfortable and had plenty of pillows and ta super long neck roll  The clock radio had the plug to hook into an MP player unfortunately I didnt bring mine but this is a great feature that many hotels dont have  The flat panel TV was also very nice The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous  The shower is very spacious with a great handheld spray that can go from spray to pulsate  The shower also has a folding seat    I didnt use it but its great for the elderly or trying to shave your legs etc The icing on the cake was that I didnt have to go outside at all After I figured out how to use the underground passages it was wonderful   plenty of eateries restaturants as well as fast food    there was even a Cinnabon which I absolutely love and shopping   I never put on a coatI didnt try room service or the mini bar   a bit too pricey for me I will definitely recommend this hotel and plan to stay here again These rooms go for well over  a night so I really got a fabulous deal 
P => Hilton Quality as usual The Hilton Bonaventure was a good place to stay in Montreal  Although the hotel itself is a bit confusing as it is on top of an office building  The layout is on  floors and there are some stairs between floors no elevator but be   low stairs  The location is great and it connects to all of the underground halls to the mall train station etc  We were in an executive room I think bc I am a Silver hilton honors member and it was spacious with  queen beds and a nice bath  The hotel is not brand new but it is well maintained adn the staff is friendly and speaks english for us Americans  
P => A bit aged but professional and well located Everything about this hotel was fine  It is a typical better than averagely run downtown Hilton property  I went there for a few days on business and ended up liking it a lot  
P => Quiet rooms This hotel is situated in an excellent safe location in downtown Montreal  It is near the train station and is within walking distance to most tourist attractions  The metro is conveniently located in the basement Our rooms were quiet clean and comfortable however one of our quotnon smokingquot rooms smelled like an ash tray apparently this a frequent occurrence at the Hilton Montreal Bonaventure according to previous reviews The carpeting is very worn with cigarette holes in it  We were afraid to lay our clothing on the bed comforters as they appeared old ades and dingy  All the furnishings are dated  Our bed was very comfortable and we got a great nights sleep The best thing about this hotel is that it was quiet The sheets were fresh and didnt reek of bleach  The bathroom was clean with typical low hotel water pressure  The free in room coffee was excellent  We had an awesome view and the windows opened for fresh airThe individual climate control worked great and wasnt noisy It is difficult to locate the hotel due to minimal signage  The lobby is hard to find because you have to take an elevator to the top floor to check in however there is no signage indicating this fact  It is also difficult navigating your way back to the hotel from the metro due to lack of signage Staff was friendly for the most part if not a bit pretentious We recommend eating at quotThe Kegquot in Old Montreal  We had a corner quotwindow seatquot overlooking historic St  Paul Street which was very romantic  The food was amazing  We also recommend quotPlein Jusquot juice available at the IGA store in Complex des Jardins Avoid the quotlight showquot at Notre Dame as its a total tourist trap  It is mostly a cheesy quotfilmquot and not really a quotlightquot show  I would rate this a  star hotel at best  
P => Good at the right price We stayed in  rooms in this property on the Labor day weekend  I found the earlier reviews to be fairly accurate  This is a nice clean hotel with a good location and efficient staff  The concierge is helpful though she can be really busy during weekends she was the only one at the concierge desk throughout our  days of stay  The Reception staff was corteous and helpful  The pool was small but satisfactory  
P => A great conference hotel My husband and I just returned from a conference in Montreal  It was our first visit to the city and we loved it  The Bonaventure was in a great location very close to the Metro station and close enough to walk to the conference site by Old Montreal  What was charming was the layout of the hotel   all rooms on   floors no elevator rides after you arrived at the lobby  The hotel was smaller and quieter than the other hotels suggested by the conference organizers  Rooms were large and clean  The service and front desk staff were terrific especially Chantal the concierge on duty for most of the week  
P => Good hotel if the price is right My husband and I age  stayed  nights for a very good price through priceline at   off advertised price  I would rate as   out of   The rooms were comfortable large clean and outdated  I would return to this hotel for one reason  the pool Exceptionally nice   not for small children as goes  ft very quickly Staff helpful  
P => Not the greatest  While my experience wasnt devistating this isnt the best hotel by any means and not what I expect from the Hilton name  The Delta is next door and looks like a superior hotel Although this Hilton is at the top of a high building the hotel itself only has  floors which means a limited number of rooms during busy times  I had a non smoking room reserved  With no mention at the desk I checked in walked to my room to find it was a smoking room  I called the front desk to inquire about this descrepancy and was told the hotel was full that night and there were no non smoking rooms available  Reading through the reviews this seems to have happened to a number of people before  I suppose its a rather common occurence The hotel is dated and retains its original look from ades gone by with exposed concrete walls in the hallway though an update includes the hallway ashtrays being filled in with concrete  The doors to the rooms look original complete with the faux wood veneer All this being said the staff was very friendly  The doorman at the front graciously allowed me to leave my car for a couple of hours  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was great with its ble tiling througout  
P => Very nice quiet hotel with a great pool My husband myself and our dhter stayed at the Bonaventure for  nights this week  We self parked our car  a day and had no trouble finding the reception desk  They were very friendly and helpful  W e were  an hour early so we had to wait while they prepared our room  We requested a non smoking room with  beds with a city view if possible  We got a non smoking room with a king bed which was fine overlooking the garden  They seemed quite full when we were there  The room was a ent size had a nice garden view the bathroom was large and well appointed the bed was very comfortable the room was clean  The or seemed very nice in the hotel and the room  We saw they were stripping  rooms bare and updating them with paint carpet fixtures vanities etc  The room was very quiet even though we were on the lowest floor of rooms we heard nothing above or around us  The bellmen front desk staff concierge etc  were very professional and ready to help us on a few occasions with maps directions recommendations on places to eat etc  We didnt eat in the restaurants there since they are fairly pricey  We all loved the pool  It is heated and we swam both nights for almost an hour  They provide free pool towels and lockers  The only things that could have been improved on were fuzzy t v  pictures and the mini bar fridge didnt seem to get too cold we couldnt find a temperature guage to adjust it ourselves  The hotel is about a  or so minute walk to Old Montreal  We were very pleased overall and would stay there again  
P => Exceptional Honeymoon Stay My wife and I spent  days at the Bonaventure and it was EXCEPTIONAL  It had been years since we had been in Montreal and we were not disappointed  From the moment we arrived we were greeeted by the professional and dapper Doorperson the Front Desk staff were extremely friendly and equally conversant in French as they were in English Im bilingual but my wife is not and the Bell and Concierge services were quick and knowlegeable  Its all about service and the Bonaventure certainly has high standards  Our suite and you must try one on your next visit was simply breathtaking  ble foyer two bathrooms my wife was happy to have her own premium bedding and we are still talking about how comfortable their pillows were a dining room to comfortably seat  and my favourite    a wide screen tv in the livingroom  The or is rich and classic and we felt like royalty   the way you should feel on your honeymoon  The food in the restaurant is scrumptious and you must eat there at least once while you are there  We had the pleasure of accessing Club Bonaventure for the morning continental breakfast and the selection of fresh baked goods fresh fruit cereals juices etc  was delicious and the staff member serving us I believe his name was Guy was outstanding  We will definitely be back to this service oriented classy hotel in the near future  
P => Sterling was the Star but OH those stairs I dont know what all the fuss is about  This was a clean QUIET well located hotel with good food available if you choose hotel food  The doorman Sterling was delightful and most helpful with directions and advice of all types  The stairs could be a problem for anyone with any disabilty  Room linens and products were above average  Staff was attentive  My priorities are cleanliness quiet well maintained rooms and this hotel fulfilled all three  
P => How much are you paying For me this place is simply about how much you pay  If you get yourself a priceline or hotwire deal for   then Id say go for it  Its tough to find a hotel of a half ent quality in Montreal for that price  BUT if you are paying anything more than that there are much nicer hotels in Montreal  Simply put  The hotel is in a good location walk to everything the rooms were clean and minimal the pool is nice and I thought the staff was friendly enough However I have stayed in only one other Hilton and the difference was like comparing the Econo Lodge with the Four Seasons  The Bonaventure wasnt even in the same league and it seemed to me like it was two different hotel chains  Enjoy  
P => Despite others negative reviews always satisfied with the Bonaventure I must rise in defense of the Hotel Bonaventure  Let me preface these comments by saying that we are regular visitors to this wonderful city and in our childless years often stayed at the Ritz Carlton on Sherbrooke because it was supposed to encapsulate the essence of Montreal  The onset of children called for a change of venue no pearls before the swine and it was at that time in our lives that the Hilton with its idyllic rooftop swimming pool became our Montreal hotel of choice  Yes people others not me were swimming this weekend  You change clothes in a small area off the pool and then swim through a short passageway to the outdoors  I have been assured that with the water temp at  degrees it is all quite comfy  No first hand knowledge but my sources are reliable The first selling point for the Hilton ease of access  We drive to Montreal from the U S  and the expressway over the St  Lawrence River Autoroute  drops us almost on the door step of the Bonaventure   where valet parking is always on hand  Self park is also available in the same underground garage  Perhaps its the vicissitudes of advancing years but Im just so happy to be rid of the car that Ill gladly fork over the dough for valet parking and head to our room When the children could make their own way to the pool and club room the fact that the hotel and reception as well as the entire facility is located seven stories up in the air on the top of an office complex was   from a security point of view   very reassuring  Also if you get a outside room the views of the city at night are terrific  The prospects from the garden view rooms looking out on the ornamental pools surrounded with shrubbery and occupied mallard ducks bobbing for food are also quite pleasant in a sort of zen like way Now that the children are off at college and the swimming pool is no longer relevant we continue to patronize the Hilton  But then with two kids in college we probably couldnt afford to return to the RitzThis hotel is perfect for visiting Montreal if like us you are willing to forgo taxis and travel by Metro  What we lose on valet parking  we make up by only occasionally taking taxis  The Metro and underground Montreal are readily accessible from inside the hoteloffice building complex without the necessity of braving Montreals winter weather     degrees wind chill this weekend  No Metro access at the Ritz   but that  be intentionalThis is our th or th stay at this hotel in just the past  years and with our gold Hilton Honors card we do get access to the club lounge which is small and modest in both its scale and offerings compared with some other Hiltons  Again that would not be our reason to stay at this hotel  We have had an occasional upgrade to an executive floor room which are no higher floor there are only two levels in the hotel just further removed from the activity surrounding the lobby pool dining and reception areas  My personal experience is that there is difference but not excessive between the executive rooms and the standard room  The distinction lies essentially in where the rooms are situated Having read the reviews complaining about s or this weekend as we walked through the lobby I asked my wife if she thought the lobby furnishings seemed quotdatedquot  Her answer was in the affirmative  My opinion quotprosaicquot perhaps but not quotdatedquot  Honestly I really dont spend much time sitting in the lobbies of hotels   except at the Manoir Richelieu in eastern Quebec  where I could spend hours with a book and a coffee looking out at the St  Lawrence River  If we are in Montreal we are either sleeping or out on the town   no long lobby visits   there is just too much to see and do The beds are comfortable and my wife reked that the linens have recently improved   no more polyester  Pillows are still pretty hard though but be thats a european thing  The rooms are comfortably furnished with a deep soft arm chair and foot stool writing desk and   contrary to some reviews   I must say that in my experience they have always been clean  The bathrooms are spotless   although THAT  not have always been the case  I believe that a number of the rooms have been refurbished   so perhaps some of the problems complained of have been rectified Regarding food and food service who eats hotel food in Montreal Cruise St  Denis Street between Sherbrooke and Mount Royal where you will find meals the equal of any of the top quotfoodiequot destinations on the planet  And when youre stuffed to the gills waddle to the the nearest Metro station and the train will punctually and conveniently drop you at the door step of your hotel One minor difficulty  Apparently there was construction taking place on the upper floors of the office building under the hotel and off in the distance we could occasionally hear what sounded like a like a high speed hand drill   One night however it seemed like there was a jackhammer beavering away right underneath our room  One call to the front desk and they quotsiccedquot the security people on the construction workers  Peace and serenity followed shortly thereafter So back to the beginning the top three reasons for staying at the Hilton Bonaventure Location Location Location  Now it should be noted that the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is right across the street sharing the same Metro stop   Unquestionably the QE is a higher grade hotel but then again there is a significant price differential  Hilton is not chic nor romantic nor   hosting as it does numerous conventions parties and weddings   cozy  Just a good hotel with good price at a good location in a great city  We like it and will return N B  I do not throw bouquets gratuitously ie  read my review from last summer of our stay at the Toronto Hilton  
P => Great Convenient Hotel Excellent hotel with a great friendly staff  Next to the train station and within waking distance to most of the attractions in Montreal and I am not employed by Hilton  Room was clean and up to date  The pool though outdoors and in ober was very nice with entrance from the indoors  
P => needs to be rubbed out and started again This place is so dated it should be pulled down and rebuilt  It is so ss in style  The concrete structure is laid bare for all to see inside the hotel and gives it a distinctly strange feeling  I could not deal with this nor the fact that the first  odd floors were office space  We stayed here in ober  on priceline   the price was good but I did not think the hotel merited  stars Some of the staff were down right rude   this is the first hotel in all my years of travelling where I was refused by a very aggresive french speaking waitress a glass of milk to take to my room when retiring for the evening after having a couple of drinks in the bar  It was nothing to do with the fact that our french was poor   she was just rude  The room was grubby and tired and most distressing of all for a female traveller the door safety chain could eaily be undone from the outside  This meant a room change after some initial disbelief of the problem and then an attitude of well whats the problem anyway I value my safety even if is just a slip chainThe food was poor and in the main restaurant the waiting staff couldnt be bothered  All n all a most unenjoyable stay here  
P => Outstanding Albeit a little difficult to find but the location is perfect Situated just away from the noisy streets the  minute walk to bustling Ste Catherine is acceptable  The hotel amenities and service are outstanding  Staff attitudes are gracious and accommodating  We required a little extra attention to our vehicle   we were met with complete satisfaction wihout any extra charges  Room service   after the posted   closing   was not an issue for the attentive staff  The hotel feels like a ground floor locale until you peer out your window  The pool and sun k offer plenty of play area for teenagers  The layout of the hotel gives an intimate feel with wide hallways a few steps up and down to each level and presents an elegant atmosphere  While reading the negative reviews I considered other hotels for this stay but I am certainly glad I did not change my reservation  
P => Terrible hotel I usually stay at Hilton hotels but is this really a Hilton Positively the worst hotel experience since I stayed in a one star hotel in Athens   The staff at Hilton Bonaventure is not very welcoming to put it gently rooms have not been refurbished for  years and are filthy and the breakfast is absolutely nothing to write home about  Situated on top of a completely dead empty and sometimes a bit scary underground shopping mall  Avoid this hotel  
P => What a great place to stay We stayed here this past Memorial Day weekend and THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING The hotel itself had an eastern feng shui look to and feel to it  It was very inviting and immaculately clean  The staff was EXTREMELY accommodating when we requested to see other rooms so that we could choose one that best suited our fancy  We choose one on the third level overlooking the beautifully serene garden  The room was ample in size and came with the standard amenities one would expect super comfortable king size bed mini bar TV recliner etc Room service was great and the restaurant food was delicious averaging about  US dollars entree  Just be prepared that the restaurant stops serving food at pm and last call for drinks is midnight  Nevertheless everything and everyone that worked there gave the impression of a very high class hotel  
P => better than average I have been in Montreal many times over the years and find the Hilton more than just an average hotel  Its not built like your average hotel in the city as its not a high rise but rather a low rise thats fairly well spread out  Our room was very clean and the bathroom although small was clean and met our needs  plenty of mirrors through out the room  Views are either of the city or the court yard which is beautiful but remember this is not a high rise  The have an indoor outdoor pool which is heated and allows you to start inside and swim outdoors even in a snow storm  The fitness room is more than adequate  We did not eat in the hotels restaurants as you are within walking distance to downtown and the underground City is right underneath the hotel   Its a short taxi ride C to Old Montreal and the Old Port and very close to just about everything  All in all its a good place to stay   not overwhelming but nice and all you need for a city where you are not going to spend much time in your room  You can park your own car underneath the hotel for C or Valet parking is C  Give yourself about   mins to get the car with the Valet parking  Very easy to find if you come in off the Champlain Bridge and Rte  as it turns into Rue University and as you enter the city the Hilton sign is right in front of you  
P => Good Hotel Good Service I selected this hotel for its location relative to a Trade Show I was attending for the week  The hotel was nice and the accommodations were fine  The service though made a great impression on me  The staff was helpful and pleasant to deal with I was upgraded to the executive floor which came with FREE High Speed Internet  There were no connection problems or special log in procedures to deal with  This was a very nice amenity The location had very convenient access to both the subway system and railway station  The underground shopping and dining areas were also accessible  The Old Port area of the city was a quick cab ride or nice walk away  The famed Crescent Street is the same but for safety sake after dark travel should be by cab  Only a couple of things to keep in mind when selecting this hotel PARKING Parking anywhere of interest in this city is next to impossible this goes for the hotel as well  There are  choices and neither are cheap  The Self Park is  to  levels underground with tight turns and tight spaces  There are no signs telling you that they only accept Visa or MasterCard  NO AMEX  Once you get to the lobby there are no more elevators  You will have to manage your luggage up and down stairs but the stairs are not that steep or high  I was able to do this with no problems with my  bag There is a heated pool which is nice in the middle of the city Overall it was a good hotel and I would stay here again for a Trade Show  
P => Better Hotel Then the Reviews Indicate I was prepared for an average experience based on the past reviews of the Hilton Bonaventure  While we did receive the Priceline room obstructed view the check in and desk service was fine  Our room was large with comfortable king size bed and pillows  Small bathroom but nice amenities Concierge was very helpful providing information on Montreal public transportation and general directions We did not use the outside pool though people were swimming in the heated pool though only  degrees We also did not eat at any of the restaurants at the Hilton If you do go try Le Ptit Plateau restaurant in the Italian district  This small BYO wine  table restaurant serves southern French food in a casual atmosphere  The food is outstanding from appetizer to dessert Overall I would not hesitate to stay at the Hilton again  
P => s retro hotel We recently just stayed at the Bonaventure last week   we were there for a sporting event that was being held in the adjacent Convention Center The hotel is unique in that it is at the top of an office building  In its hey day   it was probably awesome   they have not put any  in this hotel in years  The first room we were given was a corner alcove suite   it had a bed   a coffee table and and a chair and a armoir with a TV that was impossible to see from the bed  It was stark and missing some furniture We asked for another room   and were shown a bi level suite   which in design and square footage was nice however or was right out of the s   no modern fixtures or amenities  We have stayed in nicer road side motels with nicer furnishings for a  of the price we were paying  Convenience for location close to casino and convention center   but thats all   the staff in the coffee shop   which is the lobby bar   are awful   you have to beg for service or speak fluent french for any kind of friendly service  The hotel charges are what you expect at Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton   which is fine if everything else goes along with it   they need to put lots of  back into the hotel to really justify the price and  star rating  Wed look elsewhere for next year   and probably give up the convenience and take cabs to the convention centre wed say the hotel is a  star at best with  star prices For what they are charging   they should be seriously kissing up and providing service   drop the attitude 
P => Will return for sure My husband and I and one other couple stayed at the Hilton for four nights     and could not have been more delighted with this hotel  The staff were wonderful and went out of their way to see that we were looked after  The rooms were very clean and were made up while we were having breakfast  Unfortunately the executive lounge was being remodelled but we were well compensated for it  The gardens were beautiful and well kept  It was hard to belive that we were  floors up We would certainly stay there again if and when we return to Montreal  
P => nice hotel Nice hotel staff could not have been nicer or more helpful  Room was a little small and could use a or update but was clean  The pool and public areas were nice and were clean  We were lucky and had a room away from the construction noise but can see how it would be very disruptive  Would stay here again  
P => Pleasant Stay at the Hilton My family stayed here   through   The front desk staff was friendly  We had a lovely room  Very clean  The buffet breakfast was wonderful  Nice staff The kids enjoyed the gardens and the pool  It is a perfect hotel for families with children  The concierge was right on in her recommendations of restaurants for families ranging from quick bites to elegant family friendly spots  The location is convenient to the metro and for walking to the Downtown and even old Montreal  Warning There is construction noise most evenings from about  pm until pm  It didnt effect our stay because we were out for dinner at that time  Overall a nice stay  
P => Well located helpful hotel I stayed Thursday  to Sunday  ust   The hotel has a wide drive in from Gauchetiere street and splendid entrance leading immediately to lifts to the top two floors of the skyscraper  Reaching the hotel from the bus terminal or train station both serve Dorval Airport is easy as the hotel is linked to Montreals extensive underground walkway system  My HH Honors card gave me an upgrade so my room   have been better than average  It had a huge bed desk armchairs and was generally well equipped  Bathroom was on the small size as the door opening inwards almost touched the WC  Everything was spotless for my arrival and during my stay  Reception staff were friendly and helpful with answering several questions  There is an outdoor heated pool about  metres long open from   every morning  Business Centre closed at weekends nearest internet access is coin machines in railway station or at Chapters Bookshop  I had one dinner in hotel  A restaurant is closed for refurbishment  The kitchens were under pressure due to a wedding reception and though the service was again friendly I would rate the food as average only  Overall I would certainly stay again for the hotels location friendliness and outdoor pool  
P => Great Weekend at the Hilton I arranged a trip for  couples to go to Montreal for the Canada Day weekend  The jazz festival was on and we had a wonderful time  I have stayed at the Montreal Bonaventure Hilton Hotel many times before and it has never failed to please  Both rooms were clean and quiet  the staff were very friendly helpful and professional  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Nice  We booked thru Priceline and were happy to see that we got a   Hilton in a good location  The Hilton is in a very convenient part of downtown with nice ammenities  We didnt use the pool but it looked great  The room was large bathroom upscale and the mini bar was big enough to store some bottled water wed bought during the day   One BIG downside was the drillingpounding noise that went on each day when we were in the room from about  pm  After walking for many hours I was looking forward to some quiet time before heading out for the evening  No chance  When I called the front desk to inquire they said it was construction going on  floors down that it affected all the rooms of the hotel and that the construction permit allows them to go until pm   which it did each day giving me quite a headache  The hotel is very nice but you  want to ask about the status of the construction  
P => Hilton Bonaventure was good The Hilton Bonaventure was a very nice hotel  The management was very friendly and best of all we had very nice weather  The hotel was NOT in a quotseedyquot area but in the Metro underneath the hotel a bunch of beggars hung out there  The hotel was not completely Non Smoking so some parts smelled bad  The Hilton does offer Non Smoking rooms so we took advantage of that  The room service was ok but they really dont care about taking your plates back to the kitchen to get washed If you had room service  Our plates sat outside our room for two days with caked on food  After talking to the front desk about it several times nothing happened  The maid was the one who actually called the room service personel to pick it up  The bathroom is very clean and has a wide variety of bathing oils etc  The shower head is a Grohe sp and had many nice settings  A nice touch that I LOVED was that the TV speakers are hooked up to the bathroom too and you dont have to miss your favorite shows audio  The beds are comfortable and all of the lights are florescent so they are energy efficient and very bright  The only bad thing about the room though was we had to ask to get the heat turned on even though it was summer The AC was on for who knows how long The Hilton has a quotHotSpotquot by the pool area so if you bring your wireless router card you are in luck and you have free internet  If you dont you can get High Speed Internet for   a day and like   for dial up  The rates  change though but that is what my rates were  All in all come to the Hilton Bonaventure you will have a good time

P => Desperately Seeking Definition of Customer Service I picked this hotel based on the rave reviews so I was shockingly disappointed upon checking in and it only got worse from there  The hotel is very difficult to get to but that is not the fault of the hotel it is the poorly designed road system but I think folks should at least be aware  First to mention is that it is not  per night as even their website states  As a matter of fact the woman who checked us in said that their rate hasnt been  since the hotel first opened  She had no answer when I showed her a printout of the  rate from their website nor would she give us that price  Fine moving on  The hotel is nicely orated as are the rooms  But we did not appreciate finding pubic hair on the sheets  It was obvious that the sheets had been cleaned and changed and its one of those things that I think quotjust happens quot But when we called to have the sheets changed the attitude was as if we were quotbeing particularquot or something as if we found some dust   I understand enough Spanish to have picked that much up  Ok still not going to let it ruin the weekend  I didnt mind where the hotel was located because it is close to DorvalLachine where there are tons of great restaurants that line the waterfront  What I did mind is that while the front desk gave a full list of restaurant recommendations in DorvalLachine they failed to tell us that they actually have free shuttle service to take you there  We found this out the next day after we battled traffic and driving around looking for parking  Also to note is that the hotel is located in an industrial area so it does smell like exhaust and fertilizer Our first morning we went to make coffee and noticed there was no artificial sweetener in the room  My husband is a diabetic and we called the front desk and were told by Taa that they do not provide sugar substitute in the rooms  We asked if it would be available at the breakfast to which she replied she did not know even though the coffee stand is  feet from the front desk  Apparently she not only didnt know but didnt think it was in her job description to even find out for us  When we expressed our surprise she said quotI WORK AT THE FRONT DESKquot   CLICK and hung up on us  Are you kidding me Obviously we immediately called back which is how we got her name  Oh and yes they DO have artificial sweetener at the breakfast which we only found out after we physically went there ourselves to check it out I travel a LOT especially for work so Ive stayed in all kinds of hotels  I can honestly say this is the LOUDEST Ive ever been in   you cant hear your neighbors above below or next to you but you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the hallways  We had to complain about the noise level the entire weekend and they really do nothing about it because its usually one person at the front desk and no manager around during quotquiet hoursquot and zero security  I havent been this disturbed at all hours of the night even at convention hotels  On the plus side they do have a pretty good breakfast included in the room rate   both hot and cold food   which we appreciated  There is no restaurant or bar at the hotel but you can purchase snacks and beer and wine next to the front desk  I will say we lucked out with some phenomenal food in Montreal so not having a restaurant at the hotel was no big deal  We did speak to the manager before we left and voiced all of our concerns  She assured us she will speak with her boss and contact us with a response and what they will do to accommodate our issues  Upon our return I received an e mail that said she was sorry about our stay and the inconveniences we experienced  WOW I was not expecting a  too bad so sad  reply after the complete unprofessional attitude and behavior of her staff  In this day and age when customer service is so critical and companies compete to arate themselves from their competitors I find this type of laziness and abundance of excuses intolerable  Everyone knows that mistakes can be made but the difference is in how you handle those issues  They say you get what you pay for and in this case they couldnt be more right  If there was a lower rating than  star for service they would be getting that from me  
P => Superbe airport hotel The usual airport hotel is old noisy and you would get bad service in and outdated room  Well not at the Holliday inn express We were really impressed by the desk service and the lobby in general  The rooms are very nice and carpetless No carpet How fantastic  The complimentary breakfast was very good and included eggs and bacon and not only pastires and instant coffee other hotels offer you They have hours shuttle and secured parking for park and fly  We travel throught Montreal once per season and the Holliday inn just made it to our number one airport hotel They will be hearing rom me again pretty soon 
P => hard to find but worth it great staff Although it was difficult for us to find the place the street signs are wonky I would definitely recommend this hotel if you have your own car and want a nice place at a good price THE GOOD Our double queen suite was spacious and comfortable  There was a fridge microwave coffee maker and free wi fi  The pool area is very nice perfect for our teenager to burn off some energy  Unlike most places they actually offered wi fi and wired access for their free internet and the staff let me borrow an ethernet cable so I could have a secure connection  They also sent a fax for me without charge  The best part though was the breakfast  They had protein This is very important for a good start to the day especially for diabetics yet most hotels only serve sugar and starch  I was pleased to be offered eggs and bacon as part of the complimentary breakfast  They also had a great pool for our teenager to burn off some energy THE BAD Besides our initial difficulty finding the place I have no complaints THE UGLY Driving in Montreal is an absolute nighte but thats not the hotels fault This was a great place to stay  
P => Great location for airport New hotel so everything is spick and span although the sauna was already out of order  Rooms are large and contain everything you need  Breakfast was great  There is a shuttle bus to and from the airport which is very convenient  
P =>  Star Hotel for the Price of  star Hotel  Stayed there with Parents  two rooms  two couples  If you do not mind to Drive  minutes to Downtown Montreal Sightseeing in Montreal all day  then drive back  It is well worth   Perfect New Hotel  Modern Excelent room  Biggest room ever saw with Living room  sink and Fridge Big Bathroom  very good Breakfast and Free Parking  All Hotels in Downtown Montreal are Double Price  plus  breakfast and Expensive Parking   Anyway  you will need a car to tour around   It is at Airport area but you do not see or listen Planes 
P => A Boutique Hotel hidden in an Airport Location I have been a Priority Club Member for at least   years so I have stayed at lots of standard Holiday Inn Expresss  This hotel is truly a different and kinda revelatory experience I would up using Priority Reward Points for our  night stay which would normally limit my room choice to a standard  or  bed room   But the staff at the hotel was nice enough to upgrade our room to a full  bedroom suite which was absolutely perfect for our needs travelling with our teenage son We had recently returned from a trip to Prague and Vienna where relying on TripAdvisor again we stayed at  terrific boutique hotels and we were more than pleasantly surprised when we entered the lobby at this hotel and it clearly gave us the impression that a lot of thought and design went into creating this new kind of Holiday Inn Express The staff greeting upon arrival was very inviting and one got the impression that the desk staff truly cared about our experience  We were additionally impressed that though we arrived relatively late around pm there were still  people manning the check in The look and feel of this hotel is definitely one of far more expensive boutique hotels and that look and feel carried over to the  bedroom suite that we stayed in which was tastefully furnished including a dining table and chairs  Flat screen TVs a large bathroom refrigeratorwet bar and very attractive and comfortable bedding The hotel and our room were spotlessly clean by the way The breakfast area is also very tastefully done with a combination of tables and counters with bar height chairs The breakfast choices are more typically Holiday Inn Express style but somehow seemed to be of better quality and taste compared to many other HIE locations weve stayed in The parking lot was huge well lit and had wider than normal stall kings which helps avoid those annoying parking lot dings Two large elevators in the main lobby meant that even though the hotel appeared sold out there was no long wait for an elevator I have visited Montreal dozens of times so I was not at all concerned about the airport location of this hotel because unlike other major cities worldwide the Montreal airport is only  miles from center city The hotel was located within a  min drive to Rte  E amp W which is a major interstate type freeway which takes you directly into center city in less than  minutes If this hotel represents the new direction of design and execution for future HIE projects and also reation they are definitely on the right track  Boutique style amenities at a fair price seems like a winning combination to me  
P => Great Hotel would stay here again My husband baby and I just returned home from a  night stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Montreal  I chose this hotel because of the great reviews and it did not disappoint Cleanliness is a must with an  month old crawling around so we were extremely happy with the spotless roomsThe salt water pool area was also very clean and fully stocked with clean towels Service throughout the hotel was great  The front desk staff housekeeping and the guy that continually cleaned the floors on the main floor always greeted us with a smilehello The only complaint I have would be with the number of staff working the morning buffet  Both mornings we had to wait while the waitress cleaned a table for us  It seemed as though this one lady was responsible for cleaning the tables washing the dishes setting the tables and stocking the buffet  I would recommend the manager hire one more waitresswaitor to help out during the morning buffet  All in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again next year  
P => This is great value for money new and close to airport We stayed here one night on way back home after family vacation to the US  We had been in four other hotels in  days and this was our favourite  Free shuttle to and from airport  Hotel is new and very modern rooms were very nice the breakfast next morning was great hot and cold serve yourself and open at  am  Only  minutes from airport and new shuttle bus provided by hotel driver was friendly and dependable My teenagers thought it was great with the new and modern or the lobby is very unique and beautiful the computers were free access with large screens  Pool is a little small but as this is airport hotel and usually only one night stay that was fine for that purpose  We will stay there again for sure  
P => stumbled upon this hotel On a roadtrip to Montreal we had planned to not have a plan at all and stumbled upon this hotel near the airport  Most of the hotels in the city charge extra for parking and we preferred to not have to pay for parking  Therefore when we found this hotel we opted quickly to book a room  The hotel is located near the airport and luckily the drive into town takes about  minutes which is not too bad at all  The room itself was clean spacious with two twin beds and with modern amenities and totally perfect for at least  people traveling together  The one complaint I would have is that the windows did not keep out the noise of nearby trucks driving by in the middle of the night which was a minor inconvenience  In the morning the breakfast was pretty good I would say a small step above the standard continental breakfast  Some hot dishes like bacon eggs and sausages were served along with the standard breads and cereals  Lastly the hotel seems really new and their facilities are quite modern and clean case in point the restrooms in the lobby were comparable to ones found in higher end hotels  
P => perfect when you want to be close from Dorval We had a great time there the room are spotless Breakfast is complementary  Parking is free fro resident  You will not miss your plane as it is  mins away from Dorval  they have ashuttle service and a big screen which flight departure information  
P => what an excellent hotel it deserve at least  stars I will certainly recommend this hotel to my network    Simply because it offers the best QualityPrice Ratio  Adding to that its a brand new stuff with qualified people trying every thing possible to let you feel home  
P => We have finally found our Montreal home away from home With its comfy new beds and hardwood floors this hotel catered to our needs  Our  month old son could crawl on the floor without us wondering whether it was clean like we would if it was carpet  There was plenty of space in the suite for all  of us  It was clean clean clean The free breakfast was delightful and our sons enjoying the swimming pool while my husband enjoyed the gym  The staff were also very friendly and helpful  
P => Terrific value My family accompanied me on a trip to Montreal for business as we mixed in some family fun at the same time  Great hotel   nice new rooms great pool nice lobby and polite courteous staff  The breakfast buffet might have been the best feature   the food was excellent and having it right there and free with the room saves you a ton of time and money  The price on the rooms was very competitive and great value  We would definitely stay here again  
P => Perfect for park and fly We stayed at this hotel overnight before flying out on vacation the next day from Dorval airport  We were a party of  adults  teenagers and   month old baby  Rooms are great large enough to accommodate all of us comfortably had a mini fridge microwave and coffee maker super handy with the baby nice big bathroom very clean  Free WIFI was also a big bonus for us given the kids had brought along their laptops   Hardwood floors throughout the room which I really appreciate  The hotel parked not only one but two cars for us given that my husband and I had to drive down arately  There was free shuttle service the next morning at our convenience no pre set times you reserve it the night before and its h service  We had to be out by  h am and had time to enjoy the complimentary breakfast buffet which features hot items eggs bacon sausage and had a nice assortment of cereal toast yogurt etc  I was very pleasantly surprised by the breakfast buffet as these are usually limited to stale croissants and toast  We enjoyed the pool the night before and ordered out for pizza  I realised afterward that they had a nice selection of catered frozen meals for sale in the little shop downstairs and would surely have tried that for a more healthy selection had I known  Staff was friendly and relaxed including the shuttle driver its just a short drive over to the airport which is great  They came to pick us up as soon as we called from the airport on our way back and getting our cars was easy and fast Bottom line you cant get better value than this hotel especially if you are doing park and fly  It makes for a really easy and enjoyable experience  I am for sure going to do this every time Im flying out of Montreal  You just cant go wrong with this place especially given the very ent rates  
P => more than you pay for In e  I want to Holiday Inn Express Hotel amp Suite at Montreal Airport  I was really surprise of what you get for the price  The room are clean and really nice  They dont have carpets on the floor and the room are big  You have a breakfast include and you have quite some choice even tough is an quotexpresquot breakfast  Coffee and tea are free hday Theres a pool and a nice lobby to relax  You have acess to two computers free with wireless internet  The internet is free and pretty fast Bathroom are clean and nice towels There is a shuttle that take you to the airport  Altough we didnt stay to catch a plane its a good place to stay if you dont want to pay the full price dowtown montreal There no restaurants around but you can ask for deliveries  
P => Excellent for park and fly We stayed here before leaving for our trip to take advantage our their stay and park option  We were very impressed with the rooms and the service  Breakfast was great but usual HI fare  The shuttle to and from the ariport was very convenient  We would definitely stay here again if we were travelling from Montreal  
P => They try harder   and succeed This facility was built in late  and makes for a delightful stay  Its a little pricey but so are all the hotels in that area  The facility is modern and perfect in every way but its the staff that takes it over the top  They take the time to fully explain all the amenities with each guest at checkin and are responsive to any questions or problems  The complimentary breakfast tops anything Ive seen at other hotels  The hotel is convenient to the airport and only  miles from downtown  Its in a light industrial area which is the only thing I can think of as a negative  They have plenty of parking in a gated lot  I would not only recommend this hotel Ill make it my choice in the Montreal area  
P => Great experience   no complaints From the time I arrived till I left the experience was great The room had hardwood   perfect   no dust   bright and the room was spotless I was able to arrange for shuttle services twice without issue so that I could spend the day in downtown Montreal I highly recommend this location    staff was great   DA 
P => Hip hotel with gorgeous rooms I booked the hotel for its proximity to the airport and to accumulate my priority points  As a business traveller I have stayed at Holiday Inns all over North America  I have never seen rooms or amenities like this  The rooms are clean and sleek   mine came with two flat screens TVs  The hardwood floors were a great touch  I felt like I was in a uber trendy boutique hotel in a cities downtown entertainment district  I highly recommend the hotel  
P => Absolutely Beautiful Hotel We stayed overnight at this hotel on  nd  We didnt arrive until after pm and were back to the airport very early the next morning to catch another plane  I have stayed at many Holiday Inn Express hotels but I must say this is the nicest one I have ever stayed in  The room was beautiful I even took pictures to specifically post here  The hallways were lovely and very wide  The lobby was beautiful and the staff were very friendly  I would recommend this hotel  
P => Impressive I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Hotel amp Suites Montreal Airport  All I can say is wow All rooms have laminate flooring with modern furniture  Extremely comfortable bed with flat screen tv  Complimentary wireless internet and full breakfast Some hotels should be ashamed of charging for these in this day and age Congratulations Holiday Inn Express   better than the Hilton Montreal Airport Try it    you wont be disappointed 
P => Beautiful Hotel and Genuine Service I stayed at this brand new hotel for one night the first week of il The hotel product is beautiful Contemporary clean and comfortable I was welcomed by John evening Night Audit and was pleasently surprised  Great genuine service and felt reassured that I was at a great hotel right away Since it is an Express hotel there is not a restaurant onsite however the hotel offers an excellent selection of frozen entrees and even offers wine and beer from thier pantry  Very handy The Breakfest Bar was consistent with all other Holiday Inn Expresses and the Breakfest Bar Hostess was very friendly  The best part of my morning though was when John the same John that checked me in came by to see how my evening was and wished me a good day  He even remembered my nameGreat hotel genuine service  I will be back  
P => My Airport Choice Everytime from NOW ON Not sure how this hotel only has a   star rating it is easily a  star I was more than impressed with the room I had this is a brand new hotel  King size bed wireless internet hardwood floors and flat screen TV with High Def channels  The front desk staff was amazing arranged my free shuttle to the airport and the wake up call I needed  The free breakfast was great full service with eggs and everything else to start my day rightThis is easily one of the best and affordable airport hotels Ive stayed at in a long time  Definitely the place to stay at the Dorval Airport 
P => Very Nice HI Express Stayed here for  day meeting close to airport but very hard to get to because of the road design  We rented a car could see the hotel but could find a way to get to it  Finally saw the hotel shuttle and followed it through the back roads  Otherwise very new clean and spacious Holiday Inn  Hotel room had a very comfortable king bed large bathroom with shower no tub microwave mini fridge and coffee maker free wi fi  Very strange the wardrobe is inadequate with only space for hooks no rod  Felt like the designers added this in at the last minute  Lobby is spacious nice size breakfast area with hot breakfast included  Several business meeting rooms are available and nice size with windows  Food is catered in and very good and plentiful  Adequate  hour fitness centre and also a swimming pool and sauna room  Service was friendly and great  ATe at Forcaccio near the hotel which had nice homemade Italian food at very reasonable prices  Went to Latin Quarters Alos another night and the food was fantastic  
P => Great experience at this hotel Stayed here recently for a quotsleep park and flyquot  We were two families with small children including a baby  The hotel accomodated our request for rooms nearby to one another and also the request for a crib for baby  This hotel is new and it shows  Very modern and clean  Great big comfy beds and just overall a super nice hotel  We cht the shuttle both to and from the airport and it was hassle free and conveniant  Front desk staff were pleasant and helpful  I would highly recommend this hotel for park and fly purposes  
P => Ultimate comfort and service The only downside to this hotel is the French only road signs DThis hotel was amazing I was impressed with everything  It has hardwood flooring it is very modern and very stylish huge lobby clean and super comfortable from the bed all the way to the soft towels  They really exceeded the HI Express standards in terms of design  I currently am working in a HI Express so trust this review The staff was amazing as well very warm and were quick to give us directions to anywhere and did not hesitate to ask how everything with our room was every time we passed by  Jacki and Russel in particular were great and gave outstanding service  Thanks guysI recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Great Hotel Next to Montreal Trudeau Airport  This is a great hotel  I recommend it without hesitation  Here are some highlights  Brand new construction and very clean   Minutes from the airport terminal  Nicely designed lobby  Spacious conference roomsThis is definitively the best choice for a hotel near the Montreal Airport  
P => Hotel bellissimo assolutamente consigliato   
P => Top Hotel   
P => 
P => Nice Hotel Good Location but    DONT STAY NEW YEARS EVE Weve stayed at the Holiday Inn Express  Candlewood Suites Montreal several times over the last few years and found it to be a nice property with a good location and a friendly helpful courteous staff  But DO NOT make the mistake we did last ember  On New Years Eve HUNDREDS of college kids and high school kids checked in and ran riot throughout the hotel  They set off the fire alarm SIX TIMES starting at am  The hotel management did NOTHING about it  The drunken kids ran through the hallways lhing and screaming slamming doors and stomping up and down the stairwells to visit their friends on other floors  This went on ALL NIGHT LONG  There were fights in the hallways and the next morning there was trash scattered throughout the hotel  Other than that we had a nice stay  
P => Danger of Hotwire route  flexible hotel My friend and I got a great rate on Hotwire but learned the limits of that option  We got a room for two but the hotel gave my friend one bed at check in  When I called the hotel to get a room with two beds we were initially told that it would be  more a night  After brief discussion the front desk kindly agreed to waive that charge and we agreed to pay a one time fee of  for the room change I am grateful to the hotel for this flexibility  This is the kind of generous move that makes me ready to go back again I will write more later about other hotel details Jim Beverley 
P => Pleasantly suprised Location  within walking distance to many places Notre Dame and other bascilicas Chinatown Old Montreal Latin QuarterRoom  A whole lot larger than we expected  It really was previously apartments so the main bedroom can be an office with a pull out bedconverted couch w a tv and free internet access and the main living room space is where the main beds are  The kitchenette was very convenient  We didnt feel like we were in a hotel room more like an apartment which was comforting and spacious Breakfast  Comes with the room rate  Cereal bar ok coffee juices several types of breads oatmeal yogurt eggs pre made omelletes sausage and bacon  Better than a continental breakfast and can hold you over till lunch  This Holiday Inn Express not the Sofitel Parking  We came in through train from Quebec City so didnt need any parkingStaff  Most of the people at the reservations desk were in their s younger than expected  But they were accomodating and got the job done All in all the hotel was clean well kept breakfast was expected the room def  felt like we got value for our money  We spent  nts  in  at nt  
P => Excellent Value Our family stayed for the ThanksgivingColumbus Day long weekend and was very pleased with this hotel   Great location just a few minutes walk from the Old Port and St  Catherines Street  There is an   per day parking fee but that includes valet and inout priveleges so its very convenient and not unreasonable for downtown parking   The rooms were large and perfect for a family  As well as the standard bedroom portion there is also a kitchenette full size fridge microwave sink but no stove with a counter and a couple of stools  Plus theres a second bedroom  with pull out sofa and nd TV  Breakfast is included but its hit amp miss  The cold portion includes cereals yogurt various breads amp spreads juice machine coffee and a bowl of bananas  Perfectly adequate  The hot portion is sort of gross and includes egss amp meat changed each day  The scrambled eggs tasted strange perhaps powdered so I didnt try the fold over omelettes the next day  Bacon was very thin and greasy so I didnt try the pork patties the next day either  All served buffet style with disposable plates cups amp cutlery  Unfortunately no pool  Room rate averaged out to around  per night which is very reasonable when you consider the location size of room and breakfast for the four of us  If I return to Montreal I think Id scout out a hotel with a pool first  But unless it was around the same price Id came back to the Holiday Inn again  Id rather spend my money on the excellent restaurants in Montreal 
P => Nice Hotel I liked the hotel  It was clean they gave us a nice big suite and the breakfast was good  Valet parking is   Can  and there isnt really a good multi day public parking nearby  Hotel location is excellent if you want to visit the old part of the city and chinatown  
P => Excellent Room and Service We stayed in this hotel for  nights and I must say it was a good exprience  The staff was very helpful and curtious  The room had a an attached kitchen and a study with Wired internet connectivity The location is perfect for those who would like to visit the old montreal city as it very much walkable from the hotel  Only if they dont charge the fee for parking  
P => It was a beautiful clean and friendly hotel with large rooms  The hotel was beautiful inside and the rooms were spacious  Our room had a fully size refrigerator and sink and a queen size bed  The sheets were extremely soft and the pillows were firm  I really would recommend this hotel  You will need to pay for parking and that costs   This hotel is only blocks away from near Vieux Port and is within reasonable walking distance to Rue St  Catherine about  blocks where you have your chain restaurants and clothing stores the underground city with lots of stores to shop and the train station Saint Laurent  The superket is  block away  You can also walk to Musee de Chateau Ramezay che Bonsecurs Place Jacques Cartier Basilique de Notre Dame Montreal and take a cruise along the St  Lawrence River  We used La Ba Bateau Mouche  You can take the train to Champ de s to visit these sites but if you stay at the hotel you can walk a few blocks  like  blocks This hotel is in an excellent location as it in downtown Montreal  This hotel  also come up in your search as Holiday Inn Express Montreal Centre ville Downtown is located at  Rene Levesque East Montreal Quebec HXZ  The hotel has free internet  It has a great FREE breakfast eggs cheese sausage cereal bacon yogurt toast etc  
P => Good value great location Great location just steps from the Old Montreal and all attractions  Spacious rooms quite for downtown location  Breakfast typical for Holiday Inn  Only one disadvantage   just  elevators and one was not in use  We had to use the stairs lucky to stay on the th floor  
P => Nice hotel convenient location great breakfast My dhter and I stayed in this hotel in early y   Our room was a suitewith a bedroom with a door and a living room with a pull out sofa  There wasa TV in the bedroom and living room  There was a microwave full size refrigerator sink dishware and silverware  There is a breakfast buffet and it is the same as the buffets Ive encounteredat other Holiday Inn Express locations  There is an egg dish daily omeletsor scrambled eggs with meat sausage or bacon along with their famouscinnamon rolls toast muffins cereal juices tea and coffee  Its a prettybusy place as of around am or so  The hotel has an elevator  We did not have a vehicle so I cannot comment regarding parking  There was Internet access available but in our room it was only available withan Ethernet cable  That was acceptable for me  I understand that there was wireless available in the lobby  I have read other comments regarding the questionable surroundings  I did not have that same feeling  We were one block from Chinatown  Granted on your way to the Metro station you do pass some strip clubs but in the daytime theresnot much going on there  We were only a couple of blocks away from a large IGA store and we found thatwe could get food items there and prepare them in our rooms  That store connectsinto the large underground mall  I wanted to mention that when we arrived at the train station I inquired of one of the cab drivers about the hotel location  I was wanting to take a cabto the hotel  The cab driver obviously not wanting to deal with a small faresaid it was only quot blocks awayquot  In reality it took us almost  minutes to walk there down Rene Levesque Boulevard pulling luggage the whole time  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Montreal  It is at a good location and the price was quite reasonable  
P => Excellent location friendly staff bright clean room We stayed for one night on our way home to Toronto  The location was perfect  Close to old Montreal rue Ste Catherine etc  The room was a suite with microwave dishwasher coffee maker a tv in the living room and one in the bedroom  Also had a balcony with view of the hotel the ville  Very quiet and very clean as well as affordable  The staff was friendly and helpful  We would definetely stay there on our next visit to Montreal  
P => Good location but    Good hotel but    I went with my other half for our second year of attendance at the Just for Lhs Comedy Festival First let me start by saying we took VIA in from downtown Guelph to downtown Montreal via Toronto  I really do recommend VIA even if they ided to talk about strike action the night we arrive the Monday and actually strike at  noon on the day we were to leave the Friday  Haha we were lucky as VIA was able to get us on the am train ugh which got us to an empty Union Station in Toronto at  am a half hour before the strike took affect  But once again when VIA has everything operating it is such a great way to go from dt to dt no gettting to the airport no security checks to have to wait at and in VIA business the service is quite excellent  with full bar service and meal  snacks at a great price  Anyone want more infor about VIA Business Class in the Southwestern to Montreal corridor just ask ive done it a few times Ok back to the hotel in question  I am writing this review not only as a visitor to Montreal but also as a loyalist to the ICHotels Group of hotels whose brands include Crowne Plaza Holiday Inn Holiday Inn Express Intercontinental and others  If you read my previous posts I really try to overlook what others have said and usually find the best of each hotel  We arrive around pm into Montreal and make the short walk about  minutes from Gare Centrale to the hotel  Check in and the man at the counter is very nice  Get to the room and give me a break   if you could possibly lay down the floor plan and pick the worst room I got it  The hotel has an inner courtyard open to the outside but non the less a courtyard on three of the back walls  So I get the inner corner room looking into a dark space with a window of my neighbour to my right at  degrees and of course the window across the courtyard  It only ticks me off because if I owned a hotel this would be the last room Id give away  This is the type of room they give to someone who got a way tooo good deal on hotwire not the room you give someone who is a Platinum Priority Club member or anyone who paid website rate on the IChotels com website especially if the hotel still has other rooms available  But that being said I called down and asked for an exterior facing room and they moved me no problem  But once again why would you do this in the first place The first room and the replacement room both different layouts but both have small kitchen areas which Ive never had in any hotel room before    this actually came in quite handy  Now lets focus on the replacement room  None of the rooms have a safe but that wasnt a problem nothing went missing even with  laptops sitting out  The bed and bedding were the standard very good quality HIE Holiday Inn Express style as were the towels  The room  as others have stated is a converted condo so you have your kitchen facing what should be the living area which is where they put the beds and then the bedroom is used for the sofa and desk and the second tv  Why this layout you ask Well when we pondered this its clear that in order to comfortably accommodate the  queen beds this was the only option  The furnishings are standard simple yet solid but not cheap looking HIE type furnishings  Internet is wired high speed but  as stated earlier is quite slow  Id highly reccommend disabling your pictures in your browser settings to help speed this up  But once again it is free so that is nice The hotel is very convenient to St  Denis Theatre where alot of the Just for Lhs shows take place and St  Denis is like a really long Queen West in Toronto with a big mix of both unique and commercial stores as well as a gazillion eating establishments  alot with patios  So conveniently located that this hotel wins as far as location goes   Sketchier as you walk east and north from this hotel but still not anything to be afraid of even at night  And China town and the downtown shopping area as well as the magnificent Old Montreal are so easy to walk to  The morning breakfast bar included in the HIE price was a mad house    but well stocked with attendants always keeping the items full  The first day was the usual  cereal yogurt milk juices and the HIE cinnamon rolls and assorted breads  On the rotation day  was an omellete with or without cheez whiz and sausage patties  On day  was scrammbled eggs and bacon  With it being so busy thank goodness for the hotel not being that big so I was able to grab a plate and take it back to the room  Oh on that note the elevators are slow during peak tyimes so if you can take the stairs There are laundry machines in the back hall as well as a small tuck shop  The concierge desk seemed to always be covered when we would pass through the lobby  Well I did book this based on brand price and location    but if there is a good price at the HI Mid Town I would probably go that route as I stayed there before and it was good but pricey  
P => Pricey but worth it Great Hotel ended up getting a Queen  Suite The masterbedroom came with a walk in closet the hallway had  closets regular bathroom had a kitchen with full fridge microwave coffee maker sink and kitchen counter had a dining room and also had a living room with sofa bed couch with tv  No wireless internet only wired internet which was faulty sometimes All this for for  per night it also comes with a free buffet breakfast you can goto the lobby for tea and coffee whenever you like  Parking is not included it is bucks per dayOverall pretty ent hotel a bit more pricey but you get what you pay for security and great luxurious spacious rooms 
P => good location nice place to stay This Holiday Inn Express has a good location    convenient to walk to Old Montreal valet parking was C extranight street parking might be possible  The room was a  bedroom apt complete with kitchen microwave refrigerator dishwasher living room wsofa sleeper and a balcony  Bedroom had a queen bed  Very quiet even though we were across from the elevators and overlooked the fairly busy street good insulation  Easy walking distance to many restaurants  blocks to Chinatown  Breakfast is included and normal for Holiday Inn Express which is good hot dish eggs etc  cinnamon rolls fruit bagels bread cereal juices etc  The staff was helpful  Montreal is an amazing bilingual city with most people going between French and English with ease  Over Memorial Day weekend our stay was USnight including taxes  
P => High Speed Internet   NOT While this Holiday Inn has a good location and good service at a reasonable price there were way too many negatives for a business traveller Upon entry of my first room the bathroom had a sickening fecal smell  Over the two nights I spent in this room this smell did go away  I selected this hotel based on its offer and availability of high speed internet  On this it failed to deliver  In my first room it cease to work after an hour of use  I spent almost  hours with tech support switched cables three times before we determined that the problem was with the wall connection  I was offered a switch of rooms which I accepted  I received no assistance in moving  To my relief this room did not have the same fecal smell  As before the Internet lived up to its promise for a couple of hours and then was abysmally slow foe the remainder of my stay  I gave up trying to resolve as I did not want to spend hours on the phone again with tech support This location can use another elevator   there are only two in operation so wait times can be slightly aggravating  Further the corridors are run down and you feel institutional On a positive note staff service was excellent and attentive  
P => Disappointing stay due to filthy hallway and loud housekeeping staff We returned to this hotel while visiting family in Montreal after having a pleasant stay last fall  They informed us at checkin that due to reations our reserved non smoking room was not available and we were being given a  bedroom smoking suite that they had aired out for us  The suite was on the second floor which is apparently not often used by guests  The housekeeping storage area is there and when we got off the elevator at around  PM we were met with a number of randomly abandoned housekeeping carts in the lobby area and filthy carpets  Our suite was large and comfortable though so we stayed  At our request the carts were stored away as they should have been originally  The next morning we were woken at  by loud voices outside our room  A quick peek showed that the entire housekeeping staff was standing outside our room loudly chatting before starting their day  I informed them that there were guests on the floor and they quieted down  But   they never cleaned our suite and we returned that evening to unmade beds no towels etc  Things were quieter the next morning but on Saturday we were again treated to the loud morning chatting waking us early  Additionally this suite has strange sounds that the management is aware of  There are scraping metallic noises and banging noises on and off throughout the night  On the plus side the desk staff is friendly and helpful and tried to help us as we went from one negative experience to the next  But nothing quite compensates for walking out of the elevator each time onto a repulsively filthy carpet and then being woken by inconsiderate loud staff  of our  mornings  
P => Great Holiday Experience We stayed at this hotel for four days  The hotel is comfortable and we have never experienced such comfort before  We were just expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc  Overall this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday  It is very conveniently located in downtown  
P => I hope it is available for my next trip Im afraid to let the world know how great this place is because everyone else will book it  The staff is friendly and helpful Our suite was actually an apartment with a balcony overlooking the city  I loved being a block from Chinatown and only a few blocks from old town  Will stay here again and again and again Quality linens quality mattress  Full tub  Hi speed internet in the room  didnt use it but a full desk and ergonomic chair  
P => Comme ci comme ca  My husband and I stayed at this hotel for  nights    just for a little getaway  Positives  Great location  A quick  minute walk and you are in Old Montreal    Friendly staff  They would say hello to us by name as we were coming and going  Always had a smile   Large room  Negatives  Im not sure if this is Hotwire or the hotel but we were placed on a smoking floor and told that there were no other rooms available  Our room faced Rene Leveque St  so opening the window at night made it hard to sleep  We woke up with sore throats after the first night  It wasnt so bad the second night   Breakfast buffet  Even though it was included in the price we opted to eat out Eggspectations in Old Montreal   very good on our second morning because the quality was terrible  Cardboard bacon tasteless and weird textured eggs terrible coffee  So aside from the breakfast and the smoking floor room   this hotel is in a great location with very friendly staff and the rooms are very spacious  
P => A great place to stay the weekend in Montreal Booked  rooms for  nights under the Sweet Deals package which gives you   off the second night   a great bargain The hotel has a pretty ent location in downtown Montreal not far from the seedy Rue Ste Catherine and right across the street from Chinatown  Only a couple of blocks away is Vieux Montreal the old port which is really neat and full of great shops and restaurants right along the St  Lawrence and the quais  The rooms were very roomy the beds were large and comfortable  Plenty of TV stations in both French and English  The bathroom was neat roomy and came with the usual amenities  Also had a kitchen in both rooms which we didnt really use much  Only complaints were the water heater in our one room didnt work one morning and they had to use the other bathroom to shower  Also the AC system was not up to par it was a window mounted unit that was supposedly controlled by a wall mount thermostat   well whatever between the  of us all fairly intelligent people we could not get either rooms climate control system to work  Luckily the windows opened but that got a bit brisk overnight and into the next morning  Breakfast was alright HOWEVER I advise against going later on a weekend day  We got there around  on Saturday morning and it was getting full  On Sunday we didnt get there til am and the seating area was completely full with many families and obnoxious kids with a long line out into the lobby and people pushing and being generally rude to each other  I said to hell with it and just found a Tim Hortons conveniently located not far down Rene Levesque All in all I recommend the HI Express Downtown but be careful on weekends at its usually packed especially from  on with the weather being warmer  Plenty to see and do in the city take the hike up Mont Royal awesome view Also while most nativeslocals have a working knowledge of English most of the signs and literature is in French and can be a pain to translate if you dont know a bit of French  Just not very user friendly and very ethnocentric when you consider how hard Quebec pushes for tourists to come and check out their province especially Americans  
P => its a good hotel for a nice get away We went to this hotel for the price and location you are a  to  dollars taxi ride into the downtown and about half hour walk down to the Bell Center or to the shopping district area  The front service counter very helpful and fast The hallways seem to be run down not bright enough The rooms very big two double size beds and one room set to the side with a desk and a office table with a pull out bed with a tv  it does have a kitchen with microwave the rooms are really clean the beds are soft  The breakfest area is small will be pack by  so get there early the breakfest is alright eggs bacon cinmon buns cercels orange juice they do provide a morning newspaper at the front desk area   
P => Better than expected  We didnt find this hotel noisy staying over a weekend out of season or as shabby as other reviews had suggested  Admittedly  the carpets in the corridors are stained in a few places and the public areas could do with stening up  However our bedrooms were clean and well appointed with small kitchens a sitting room and reasonable sized bathroom bath products were ok but not plentiful just shampoo and bath gel  Breakfasts were standard Holiday Inn Express fare but adequate  Location is on the doorstep of a small Chinatown with about  minutes walk or less to Old Montreal and generally well placed for sightseeing  
P => Big room small price  Stayed for a weekend with some friends to have fun in Montreal   found it for a great price on Priceline and ended up in a one bedroom suite with pull out couch in the living room area and kitchen for   a nightThe room was in pretty good shape except for some beat up corners of coffee tables and some edges of the walls but I really cant complain  The beds were comfortable the bathroom was very clean and had enough tolietries and towels and the kitchen had a mircowave full sized fridge dishwasher and a set of dinner platescupsbowls etc   Staff were friendly promptly offered us umbrellas when they saw we didnt have one for a sudden rainstorm  Gave us suggestions on where to eat and called cabs for us whenever we wanted to go out The location wasnt RIGHT downtown but it worked  The hotel is near China Town and not too far from Rue St  Catherine  Would def go back  
P => Lies and Reservations Booked through hotwire and when we got to the hotel they told us we were booked into a smoking room  I asked why and they said hotwire had booked a smoking room  I asked to change to a non smoking and they said yes they could change but for   We couldnt convince them otherwise and were even told that transferring from a smoking room to a non smoking room is quotconsidered an upgradequot and that this was hotel policy  The hotel room was not only extremely dingy and run down it smelled stuffy and strongly of smoke  I have used hotwire many times and had never had any trouble before so I looked up their terms of use and it specifically says that hotwire books non smoking rooms and that room is assigned at check in  My husband and I are extremely unhappy with this experience  On top of it all the room was noisy we could hear people walking above our floor and also people going up and down the stair well all night  We did not sleep  Safe to say that this was my worst hotel experience ever  
P => Dont stay on New yearsdirtyloads of smoke There were a few good things about this hotel   the people who worked there were very nice the rooms were large and it is centrally located between Old Montreal Rue Saint Denis and Mont Royal  Even though it was freezing we walked most everywhere though the Metro is very close  Now the bad part the place was swarmed by groups of tough looking college age kids on tour buses   how many it is hard to venture a guess but Ill estimate at least   Im young too and I like to have fun as much as the next person but this hotel was the very definition of a ZOO  I swear Im not a wuss and really want others to have fun but it was out of controlThey asked the people coming in who were coming to party at the hotel to sign a waiver for damage in their rooms because there is no bar and NOT to party in their rooms  Instead they said they could be in the lobby outside the hotel etc  When you got off the elevator during any time over   days there were dozens of drunken idiots milling about or when waiting to check out sitting on their bags so that no one could even attempt to get by them  Then try to get out the door through drinking smoking swarms  NO ONE at the hotel asked these people to move get out of the way etc  It was ridiculous  There was so much pot smoke in the hallways even though I was on a non smoking floor that is was like being in the movie quotUp in Smokequot  Then they were banging on the doors screaming quotquot for the room the big party was in  No one at the hotel really cared even though these folks put signs up as early as AM for the alldayallnight party At about  AM the fire alarms went off over and over again  No announcement no explanation at all  Just kept ringing on and on in the hallways and rooms and five firetrucks outside  It was piercing not to mention infuriating and we were exhausted the next day  I kind of feel bad venting but I just cant believe the people running the place had such little disregard for the many other people staying there  The hallways are foul   the rugs are filthy and stained   ugh The rooms were good but for the experience wayyyy overpriced  
P => Great big rooms   so so breakfast Booked through Priceline for US all inclusive  The hotel is well situated close to Berri UQAM and Place des Arts stations the underground city the Quartier Latin an Chinatown  Street parking is free on Saturday from PM up to Sunday PM so take advantage of this if you are there on the weekend  The hotel itself is simple and effective check in was easy arrived early but still was accommodated  The room is huge studio style with a queen bed a full size kitchen minus stove there is a microwave and a good work station with free internet connection  The bed itself was a tad too hard to my liking but I could spend a week there  Note that the IGA at Complexe Desjardins is  blocks away so it is possible to do your groceries there  Bathroom was standard with a rather anemic shower  But all was clean and in good shape  Carpet has seen better days As with all HI Express breakfast is included with bland powdered scrambled eggs bacon good the infamous HIE cinnamon rolls OK at best yogurts toast frozen waffles fruits OJ and ent coffee  They provide you with a take out bag if you want to eat in your room  The gym was small and spartan with second had equipment but functional  Overall I recommend this place if you are on an extended stay with no car valet parking is CAN per day  Overall very pleased with my stay  
P => Good and Bad PROS great locationclose to metrosubwaychinatown and shopping newly reated rooms friendly and helpful staff breakfast fineCONS need new mattressestoo soft hand towels frayed and not white dirty bedding piled in hallways hallway carpets dirty and paint stained 
P => Great Value Stayed  nights at the Holiday Inn Express  All hotel staff very friendly and helpful especially valet and housekeeping  Suite was nice and clean  Great location with metro Chinatown Old Montreal Plateau and downtown all within easy walking distance  Breakfast in the morning was great Will definitely stay here again  
P => Loved the location but no Timmys within walking distance As soon as we got up to our floor we noticed dirty bedding piled sporadically along the hallway this was a normal sight for the two nights we were there  Our room smelled funny and in the kitchenette a drawer was stuck open the carpeting was gross and had holes here and there where nails stuck out our tv was scratchy most of the time and the shower leaked The breakfast felt like running the gauntlet and the coffee was like nothing Id ever tasted before and hope never to again  We had asked the concierge directions to the Metro and to a Tim Hortons and both times we were misdirected  Timmys lovers beware Once you taste the coffee provided youll want to find the closest oneBut over all I cant complain too much  The beds were comfy and the air conditioner worked well   Recommended for those who wont stay in their rooms very much and the bonus being close to China Town and Old Port  
P => Excellent We booked this hotel based on reviews from here  We used our AAA card and got a  bedroom suite for  a night  The room was excellent and huge  It was like living in an apartment or a condo  The room was very clean with no problems at all  The staff was very nice as well  Will stay here again  
P => Great location a bit shabby Our family of five stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in downtown Montreal for three nights The pros   Excellent location within easy walking distance to the old city the metro many restaurants Chinatown etc    Our two bedroom suite was very large with a arate living room and kitchen    Comfortable beds good shower though hot water ran low after three or four showers    Suite was clean The cons   Needs better maintenance  Down the length of the hallway the baseboard trim had been removed and the wallpaper was curling and tearing  There was no sign it was being repaired  In our room a closet latch was broken and hanging off the wall  Not the kind of condition you expect at this price  
P => Good all suites hotel in great location Excellent location very comfy beds nice large suites breakfast was very good plentiful and typical American  Hotel valet service was also very good  Reception staff was quite rude and not helpful Would definitely stay again at this hotel  
P => Excellent value great staff Very pleased with this hotel  Convenient location in walking distance from the old town   ideal for tourists  Three of us a couple plus a single friend were travelling together so we called ahead to check if the suite had privacy between the bedroom and the living roomsofa bed area  I dont know if it was this phone call that made the difference but we were given a huge suite with completely arate bedroom large kitchenliving area see picture large bathroom and loads of closet space   all this at a very reasonable cost  The room had all we needed   our only regret was that we could only stay one night  We were particularly impressed by the friendliness of all the staff especially those on the front desk and the guys on the door responsible for valet parking  All of them went out of their way to help us with maps directions suggestions for sights and restaurants etc  If we go back to Montreal well certainly stay here  
P => Nice city   Good Hotel We liked montreal very much  This hotel was ok price clean and good location  Staff was nice too  
P => Good I found the reviews here at TripAdvisor quite helpful  I booked the two rooms directly through HI  number and asked for two rooms together one a suite and one double however the rooms were arated by the elevators and not adjoining as requested  Not a problem for me but if the other room was going to be for my kids then I would have been livid since one only finds out about the problem after payment check in etc The hotel location is central and the secure indoor parking is worth it considering you still have your car in the morning  It was winter and we didnt have to worry about the snow removal problems that were encountered after a major storm went through Breakfast was very good  Lots of variety even when we arrived a little late for the posted times  Well stocked buffet and nice staff all around Rooms were nice and clean good size and suite even had a dishwasher  Hallways were a little shabby  We were th floor and it was nice and quiet  
P => Loved it Excellent hotelpretty good locationvery cleanlooks like newhuge roomawesome bed My only complaint was with the location of the toilet bowl at the bathroom which was extremely close to the wall I do not have a logical explanation for this detail since the bathroom is quite big The bell boys are very niceespecially the Cuban guy You have to pay about  for valet parking which is reasonable if you take into consideration that parking meters cost  per hour In addition they keep the cars at a closed garage and in the morning tha car is brought to you very warm Would definitely go back to this HI Express  
P => Defnitely recommened I stayed here in ober  for two nights  I was extremely pleased with this hotel  The staff were incredibly nice and helpful the location is close to the Palais de Congres where I had a conference and the price was very reasonable  The rooms are huge because theyre suites  I had two queen beds in one room a kitchenette and another room with a sleeper sofa  Lots of space  I definitely recommend this hotel There were two negatives that subtract from my rating just a bit First the beds were not great the mattresses were a little lumpy and could stand replacement  Second it was a bit noisy  There was no noise from adjacent rooms but the refrigerator in the kitchennetee was noisy when it went on and the hotel is on a fairly busy street  It was mostly quiet enough at night but very loud construction outside started up around am  
P => Nice clean inexpensive hotel Ive stayed at a number of hotels in Montreal with mixed success  This trip I was just in town for one night and wanted a cheap place to stay  So I used Priceline and received a rate at the    Holiday Inn Express for   I was hoping for something a little nicer but in the end the HI Express was just fine for this little trip Check in was quick and friendly I was told about the breakfast times and that there was a business centre with free internet very handy  Also free wireless in the rooms The room itself was on the th floor   a nice suite with a balcony and kitchen   much more than what I was expecting  Nothing was luxury but everything was comfortable and clean  The bed was firm but comfortable and the shower had one of those big showerheads that I love The breakfast in the morning was ample if you like carbs   none of the hot items that Ive seen at other HI Expresses eggs sausages were available  Otherwise it was ample with lots of cereals bagels waffles juices etc  Lots of seating too Overall a nice middle of the road hotel  Its location on Rene Levesque is close to lots but on a fairly uninteresting street  A few blocks to Ste Catherine shopping near Chinatown and a  minute walk from Old Montreal  This hotel is good nothing exceptional but for the price is good value for money  
P => Good Value We booked a  room suite using Visa points and their travel agent which worked out to just over  with parking and taxes  The bedroom had a firm queen sized bed the kitchenlivingroom had a comfortable sofa bed  All furnishings were a bit dated but clean  Our room  had a balcony with a view of Montreal towards the harbour  The kitchen does not have a stove only a microwave  The room was quiet and we did not hear any neighbours or the traffic  The AC is a window type and worked well  All windows opened  There are  computers with internet access that you can get to with your hotel key but they were quite busy  Theres a laundromat  each for washerdryersoap  Breakfast was plentiful and included fresh fruit but no meat or waffle maker  It was difficult to find a free table to use  The only drawback was the valet parking   totally unnecessary since the hotel has underground parking  The valets took our only key so we had to bother them whenever we needed something from our vehicle  Everyone was friendly spoke English and were very helpful  We liked the location in between the port park and sites and Mt  Royal and the underground mall and city centre  We did have to walk by a strippers joint which is around the corner but never felt unsafe  China town is very close by too  
P => Great location comfortable suite We stayed  nights here and the location was perfect    mins walk from the riverfront  mins to Chinatown and about  mins to the old town Suite is large enough for  adults and  teenagers bedroom a bit small and hot as only aircon in living room bathroom fine kitchen very big with all the facilities  Nice Balcony overlooking old town towards the river Complimentary breakfast was OK   not a great choice but food was fresh Staff were very helpful  
P => great value location Got this through hotwire for about nt including taxes  At first I was surprised that a Holiday Inn Express was rated  stars  Upon arrival the check in was friendly and efficient  When we got to our room we were extremely surprised  A true BR suite with a arate livingkitchen area  The kitchen had a full fridgefreezer and a nuker a breakfast counter the living area had a couch comfy chair coffee table and TV  We also had a tiny balcony used only to check out the outside temperature  The breakfasts were not as good as La Quinta but the coffee was GREAT Im convinced if the plastic bathroom cups were glass and the name changed to Hyatt people would pay an additional  and be happy  A great choice 
P => Reliable HI Express We stayed at the HI Express in Montreal during the period      This hotel is your standard Hi Express but offers a laundry service a small business centre with  computers and your standard breakfast of toast cereal tea coffee amp juice  All the staff are very friendly and helpful as are the valet service members  Parking the car can be a problem as the hotel is located on the main road Rene Levesque and parking for the car to arrange the valet to park the car can at times be difficult particularly during the period     hrs due to parking inspectors on the prowl The room was of a very good standard which contained a small kitchenette consisting of a medium sized fridge microwave sink etc  The bed was firm and comfortable and the bathroom of a ent size with the water pressure being very good  The hotel is located near Chinatown a  min walk and downtown a   min walk depending on where you are heading  
P => Exceeded Expectations Listen to the reviews that you read on TripAdvisor about this hotelThats what my husband and I did back in uary  We were looking for an inexpensive hotel that would give us a comfortable night in Montreal  Thats exactly what we got and more  For just over  we got a beautiful   and clean   suite with fridge microwave living room arate bedroom with queen bed and large bathroom  Better yet they offer an excellent free breakfast that was well stocked in a nice dining room  This hotel would be great if you have a family or youre on a budget that doesnt fit a boutique hotel  
P => Great Family Hotel As a family we stayed here for a few days during the Jazz Festival Week and Canada Day      My family enjoyed it very much  Everything is within walking distance  St  Catherine shopping Underground Shopping Mall Old Port Old Montreal Chinatown Notre Dame Basilica  Get the standard suite you wont be disappointed  It is very comfortable and spacious  There is also continental breakfast  pretty ent variety in the morning  We would definately come back another time  There is valet parking at an extra cost  Also try the jet boating at Old Port the kids age   loved it 
P => Great for the price The hotel is located at the far eastern end of the downtown strip between St  Laurent and St  Denis  While this end of downtown isnt as posh as the more western end it is perfectly safe  As a result of the location the hotel is cheaper than most downtown hotels but this shouldnt bother an average tourist who will find it close to Old Montreal and the vibrant Rue St  Denis  The hotel hallways are a little rundown but the rooms are immaculate    nicely furnished with high end linens clean and a bonus for families a small kitchenette for breakfast and lunches  The staff are extremely courteous  The complimentary breakfast is a cut above the usual continental with hard boiled eggs a variety of cereals and toasts coffee fruit pastries and juice  Very good value for the money  
P => Great location for all Montreal I stayed here for the Canadian Grand Prix weekend  My third time in this wonderful city This hotel is brilliant  Its clean and modern with large bedrooms containing two double beds and still with loads of space for you to move around in  The bathrooms are modern well lit and very shiny too Theres a small pool a sauna and a small gym also The Metro station is just across the street corner at Place dArmes so the whole city is easy to get to if you do not fancy walking  If you do want to walk turn left and within five or ten minutes you can be in Old Montreal or down at the port  Both are very nice areas  The other way towards the modern vibrant parts of Montreal and the underground shopping is a longer walk but its still easily witin reach  There are always taxis waiting outside for you if you wish All told I would describe this place as a very good business class hotel that would also suit tourists looking for a good comfortable base to see the wonderful city  
P => No worries at all The staff couldnt be nicer  Free Breakfast Buffet was tasty  Parkingis expensive but it is anytime you park at a hotel in a metroplitan city  Location was fine its a block off St Catherine and sure there are some bums and other quotinterestingquot folk but theyre everywhere in Montreal We had a suite    arate bedroom and a fold out couch in another room  Both were fine  Nice kitchen too  Hotel is about  minutes by foot away from Chinatown  minutes away from Old Montreal and the Latin Quarter Highly recommended  no complaints at all  
P => Great locatio great hotel This hotel is located in the ideal area  It is so very close to Old Montreal we walked there one evening and enjoye it  Downtown the heart of downtown is only a couple blocks away everything is walking distance  Shopping is an abundance St  Cathrine Street is only two blocks up  The hotel is very clean and nice  We stayed in a one bedroom suite it was very cozy  The bedroom was smaller then I expected however my in laws had a bigger bedroom  Also the coach is sleeper sofa so it converts to bed for another bed if need  The room had a fridge a sink cabinets and microwave coffee maker and an electric kettle for hot water no stove  Our room had a small balcony outlooking the major street but traffic noise was not a problem of course sirens could be heard if an ablunance drove by but that happened once only during our stay  Our room was across the elevator which was a downside because people tend to be loud in the hallway and while they way for the elevator so sometimes you could hear people  The other downside to our stay was roudy teenagers that stayed on our floor they ided to go out at  am and were more then loud while they were leaving and we could hear them outside  The breakfast was great they had the same selection each morning however there was a lot to choose from  Mostly everyone spoke English however there were some employees that were hard to understand their English  We booked from them a  hour tour the night before we went and its worth the money  The parking is a bit expensive it was  per day  We would stay there again if we ever come back to Montreal I dont see the reason to spend much money of fancy hotel when this is very clean convinient and very nice  
P => ideal location We stayed for one night in   We booked the day before and arrived late morning to enquire if we could leave luggage and car to avoid further parking costs  To our pleasant surprise we were booked in and given a room straight away Surprisingly the room was a suite with kitchen and seating area etc  It was very clean and roomy  The breakfast was good and plentiful with alot of choice for a continentalThe staff were a mine of information and very willing to help especially the valet parking attendent we would have missed places if it was not for him The location is ideal for the old town Down side is the cost of parking 
P => Wow I visited Montreal with my boyfriend and a friend  I booked this hotel for the free continental breakfast  When we arrived we were amazed by how big the room better said apartment was  The room has a walk in closet huge bed huge space  The living room has a big space as well  It has a big kitchen and dining table for   It was the cleanest hotel I have stayed in a long time  The service was awesome too as well as the breakfast simple but good  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone As for the area it is located in downtown close to many amenities and chinatown  The area around wasnt so nice but it was more or less the same around downtown too  A lot of homeless people and punk kinds  One final thing you will not be able to buy alcohol at a store after pm  
P => Great Place to Stay Great price room and location  The Suite we stayed in was larger than we thought it would be  I thought the location was good not in the heart of the city but if your willing to walk then this place is great  We walked all around the city from the hotel but then again we dont mind walking  I would recommend staying here if you want a clean nice place that is affordable and in a good location  
P => Almost perfect We loved the arate bedroom The kids slept on the pull out couch in the living room and we stayed up later in the bedroom  It was also great to have a kitchenette  We ordered take out which was so convenient with small children  The breakfast is also fabulous    we all love their cinnamon rolls  The only problem is no pool  But other than that everything was great  
P => NEw Years Eve  My husband amp I and another couple stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for New Years Eve  We found the hotel to be very centrally locatedour suite was very clean and the staff was friendly  We stayed on the th floor and had a wonderful view  This was our nd time staying in Montreal  the first on our honeymoon in  and we will return again possibly in the spring or summer  I would definetly stay at this property again  
P => how do they do it whenever I have the opportunity to stay at a holiday inn express I take it and have yet to be dissapointed  The rooms at this location are huge  It has a mini kitchen with an almost full size fridge sink and microwave  The bed was more than comfy  The bathroomvery important for me was roomy and extremely clean The view from the hotel room was not great but the room was quiet and hey if I want the view ill head up to the top of mount royal The continental breakfast downstairs was above average for quality and quantity of food  the eating area was big enough that my morning paper was read in peace The area of the city is not the nicest in montreal but you are within waking distancenot winter to many attractions  old montreal place des arts palais de congress  Montreal pool roomfantastic steamed hot dogs and poutines China town Once the sun goes down the hotel is located in the part of town that is alittle seedy  even though montreal is a safe city some people might find it uncomfortable walking around but the  hr doormen will be more than willing to call you a taxi to whisk you away to the citys neon lights  The hotel is very secure and at no time were there any issue with security  In the winter china town is walking distance as well as old montreal but most other spots of the city would be a taxi or metro ride  My only complaint if you want to call it that was the fact that the parking was limited and you pretty much had to use the valet parking which ran at   a day plus taxes after  days it added up The value of this hotel was great  location   service   clean    big rooms  and very well priced I dont think you get a much better deal on the island of montreal  
P => Convenient location for sightseeing  A comfortable conveniently located hotel with friendly staff  
P => As good as everyone says Expected the hotel to be good after reading the reviews   lived up to expectations and more Have stayed at many Expresses and this was the best by miles  Staff were friendly helpful difficult to find anything on the downside I noticed there have been comments about the area being seedy I guess those writing that have led very sheltered lives   its better than many inner city areas Ive stayed in in North America  We were out very late most evenings and never felt threatened we were just aware as anyone should be out late at night in a city  There were a very few beggars on Ste Catherine but we were never approached and all seemed young and friendly mainly displaying boards for funds to buy weed   full ks for honesty 
P => Still a good deal  I first stayed at this hotel in  when it was Hotel Suites Le Faubourg  This property is now partially owned by Holiday Inn  I have made  returns to this property including most recently in ober  all staying at Holiday Inn Express rooms  ROOMSThese rooms are clean and spacious  It comes with a small kitchen area with a refrigerator dishwasher microwave coffee maker kettle sink bottle opener and lots of empty cupboard space  Some have plates cutlery and cups otherwise theyll send you styro plates and plastic cutlery  There is a small eating area with bar stools  The entertainmentoffice area is nice with a quot TV and nice furniture sofa bed chair ergonomic office chair desk lamps end tables and entertainment stand  arate bedroom is nice and large with a closet entertainment stand with quot TV alarm clock and night tables  Bathroom is nice roomy clean and bright  Hall closet has an ironing board and iron  The internet worked well  Request a balcony they are nice and overlook Old Montreal  Dont expect to get one make sure you request itCOMPLIMETARY BREAKFASTIts ent and starts the day off right  Coffee tea hot chocolate milk cream  kinds of juices apple orange and cranberry waffles boiled eggs small muffins cinnamon rolls bananas grapefruit  kinds of cereals toast and more  If you want to spend money go to Chez Coras on St  Catharine LOCATIONGreat location as long as your mission isnt to drink the night away on Rue Crescent  Its close to Old Montreal  minute walk close to the Eaton Centre  minute walk close to  Metro stations Chinatown a couple blocks and the Latin Quarter  minutes north on St  Denis  About a  minute walk to Rue Crescent for those who hunger the Toronto crowd  OVERALLHoliday Inn Express Centre Ville provides good value however if you are staying for more than a few days or enjoy having a full kitchen with a stove head on over right next door to Les Suites Faubourg St  Laurent  Its the same building same rooms same amenities same valet parking rates and even the same furniture in many cases  Rates appear to be about the same  However Les Suites Faubourg St  Laurent rooms come with stoves for those who enjoy cooking once in a while  Thats what I enjoyed most when I first stay at this property  years ago prior to Holiday Inn and I will give it a try once again on my next trip to Montreal  For those who do enjoy cooking head west on Blvd  Rene Levesque for a   minute walk to the IGA for food and drinks Reference Links   Holiday Inn Centre Ville       Les Suites Faubourg St  Laurent        
P => Great suite hotel big rooms flies on breakfast Excellent big suite rooms digital TV services with latest movies available via  TVs bedroom or living room big bathroom with all the supplies and plenty of towels    you dont wanna leave the roomThe location is not that good we found nothing of major interest nearby  The streets near the hotel didnt seem that safe either  Plenty of dirty back alleys with a bum or two begging for money Our good standard breakfast experience seemed to invite all too many insects to the table as they kept gathering over the plates for the whole time we were there  There were none of these in the guestrooms so something could be made to correct the situation  
P => Roomy suite with saggy double sofa bed in the living room The Holiday Inn Express at Centre Ville is located on Rene Levesque near St  Laurent  We were automatically upgraded to a suite from a room with  queens though the suite had a queen in one bedroom and a pullout double sofa bed in the living room  The sofa bed sadly sagged  Our suite faced the inner courtyard and was quiet  The air conditioning unit is very quiet and is located in the living room  The suite was clean and well maintained  The room was clean and relatively large  The internet is by ethernet cable so make sure you bring your RJ  cable unless you want to work in the lobby area with wireless  The suite has two quot televisions and a kitchen area  The kitchen is a full kitchen as the suite was designed to be a one bedroom apartment  The kitchen has a full size refrigerator sink and dishwasher but no stove  There is a microwave  The staff is friendly and bilingual though they do push too hard to get you to have your GST refunded automatically for a  charge  You can apply for the refund yourself for free  The free continental breakfast is pretty good with a good choice of breads muffins and their cinnamon rolls fruit yogurt hard boiled eggs cereal and drinks  The drinks are too watery and the branded st roast coffee is too bitter  But then again its almost free   The location is near Chinatown and the Latin Quarter  But beware to the north and east are the adult areas that attract a seedier bunch though it did not feel unsafe to walk there during the day before dark  Old Montreal is to the south and about   minutes away  Parking is valet only and about day  You dont want to park elsewhere and be careful not to park in the hotel zone only between   pm on weekdays on Rene Levesque  Be careful driving in Montreal as the traffic is really bad with one way streets and no left turns during heavy traffic hours  Walk whenever you can  
P => Good value for a suite The fact that we were in a suite really made our stay worthwhile  For the price of a room consisting of a bedroom and bathroom you also get a little living room kitchenette with breakfast bar and a terrace  It was great  Though we stayed inside one night due to torrential rains our time spent indoors felt like we were in an arpartment instead of stuck in a bedroom  A Metro stop St Laurent and St Catherine Streets are close by though the immediate area while not unsafe is blah  The portable ac units were different but functional and easy to deal with  Service was efficient and very friendly  The valet parking was reasonable  Overall a great value  
P => Great Family Value for Money Very family friendly Spacious clean quietMy husband my  year old dhter and I just returned from Montreal  We travel often to Montreal for long weekends visiting festivals family amp friends and have stayed at several hotels in the downtown area  We especially like accessibility to pound the pavement walk within the downtown core near St  Catherines This past weekend we ided at the last minute to travel stay over Saturday and Sunday and couldnt find a hotel room anywhere even in any of our previous choices  So I hesitantly chose the Holiday Inn Express  Centre Ville based on other Trip Advisor reviews and  because it was available As others said    clean clean cleanFor anyone with young kids at hotels you learn a couple of things     Dont really need elegant lobby areas with ble fancy upholstery and priceless antiques   Do need space elbow room so it was really great to have a arate bedroom really a ior one bedroom apt to put them to bed and still give the parents a place to put your feet up and have a drink at night The kitchen is a godsend full size fridge microwave bar stools and a real kettle not just coffeemaker is great to have as we usually travel with some food items order in food fix some late night snacks or carry medicines  Let someone else struggle to park underground valet   fixed daily rate with your overloaded vehicle xday while you schlep upstairs with kids is another godsend Valets carted up bicycles strollers and other wheels to the front door in no time flat Great closet space two full closets amp large bathroom Dont need a big fancy  hotel breakfast for an egg amp bacon strip your family needs their own favourites   included Not just a family friendly hotel lots of diversity in the guests from the US amp beyond couples partners all visitors QUIET QUIET QUIET for sleeping at night  Long weekendVery few downsides    if anya No swimming pool but do have fitness centre amp internet b No quotviewquot to speak of but were familiar with Montreal and got our viewing in each amp every day  Will definitely make this our   Montreal choice for next few years 
P => Convinient and good value Stayed here for  nights got a suite as standard and asked for and got a room with a view of the old town  Suite was roomy and had all the necessary facilites  Staff very helpful and friendly  In terms of location its central but inbetween areas so although there isnt much but other hotels and offices immediately around its around min walk to Town Hall and old town about mins to Latin Quarter  Nearest Metro is Champs de s about mins away  I found the continental breakfast provided ok and having free broadband access in room was very convinient too  I had no trouble with noise as described by previous posts and I did stay a fri and sat night which is when I most expected to have these problems but be i was just lucky  With reference to the comments about the clubs etc in the area they are not directly near the hotel so unless you go out looking you probably won t see anything  Only bad point was there was a fire evacuation on the last night I was there but of course that could happen anywhere  Overall I would recommend this hotel  
P => Great value great location This hotel is in a fairly new building that was designed to have full apartments not hotel rooms  This is a good thing  The building is concrete and very sound proof  Each room has its own hot water tank and apartment sized erate kitchen although most of the rooms lake a stove they have a microwave sink and fridge The hotel is located only a couple blocks from Old Montreal to the SouthChinatown to the South West and downtown business district to the West  Everything is walking distance  No need to bring a car The Camp De s Metro subway station is two blocks to the East and one block to the South from the hotel if my memory serves me right anyway which is easy walking distance The hotel is on a major thrufare Blvd Rene Levesque Est which has plenty of cabs too  My room was facing on to the inner courtyard and it had thick double panel windows so I heard no traffic noise even on the th floor This hotel uses floors  through  and   are used as apartments who use a erate side enterance and elevator Service is exceptional and this is by far the best hotel Ive stayed at    and it was cheaper than a lotNo flaws for my perfect vacation in Montreal until I stayed at that awful Aeroport Montreal Holiday Inn that is  
P => Safe and Clean We arrived one day late to stay at our hotel and there was no problem since Air Canada cancelled our flight to Montreal  We stayed in a one bedroom room where my  year old son and I slept in the queen bed and husband opened up the sofa bed  There were  tvs and it was very roomy  The air conditioner is only in the bedroom which stayed very cool but the rest of the room was a bit warm but we opened up the screen doors  No balconies which is fine because too scary with kids The free breakfast every morning was great ask for a tray and bring it all to your room and coffee all day long  It is situated very close to Old Montreal and the Science Center   great for kids  Safe and clean  We used the washers and dryers also  The staff were very friendly  Id stay there again 
P => Nice hotel superb jumping off point sketchy location  I want to preface my review by saying that my husband and I have traveled all over the world for both business and pleasure staying in hostels dumpy motels  and  star hotels as well as BampBs  The Holiday Inn Express was very clean gave a generous sized room I was told that there were queen beds only throughout hotel so if you need a King you might want to call complete with kitchenette had a well supplied free breakfast offered free high speed internet in every room had nice new furniture in the room  and a helpful staff with the exception of check in when we arrived at pm and were told to wait in the lobby until pm because thats when check in started   just silly  I would stay in the hotel again although I would prefer a room in Old Montreal You might be saying to yourself   but when I search Tripadvisor for hotels in Old Montreal this hotel is listed  This hotel is not in Old Montreal by any stretch of the imagination  It is a solid  minute walk to the heart of Old Montreal a ten minute walk to the edge of Old Montreal  Of course this hotel is a block away from Chinatown and since my husband and I are die hard dim sum and bun fanatics we were in heaven  Back to location information though Holiday Inn Express is indeed convenient like the other reviews mention  It is only two blocks to the Metro station and a good jumping off point because of its central location if you are walking to various tourist destinations in the city If you are not a seasoned traveler or have small children I think you will take offense to this particular location because of the red light and clubparty district which is directly behind the hotel  Sex shops line this end of Blvd  St  Laurent as well as the nearby section of Rue Ste  Catherine  There is a sketchy skateboard park attracting some seedy characters a block behind the hotel as well as hookers along Boulevard St  Laurent once you hit Rue Ste  Catherine  We also saw the XXX billboard truck circling the neighborhood over and over again and parents with children who can read  not want to have to explain things like this or have their children eyeing the sex toys that are displayed in store windows on your walk to the Metro station  Did I feel safe Yes  Anyone who has traveled to NYC or similarly large cities is used to this sort of thing and these types of characters and it probably wont faze them  I would feel a bit uncomfortable walking back from the Metro Station after dark but certainly not to and from Old Montreal after dark  The area doesnt get dicey until after you cross Blvd  Rene Levesque Oh one last hint ask for a room in the rear of the hotel because while the view of Old Montreal is surely spectacular Blvd  Rene Levesque is a very busy and noisy road  We were on the side towards the rear on the th floor and could still hear loud cars horns and motorcycles during the night  I was thankful that I read this tip from another user and took it to heart  I thought it was worth mentioning again  
P => Location  This is a standout pick for lodging in downtown montreal for two reasons First location The hotel it is kitty corner to a Metro subway stop so you have a launching pad to go most anywhere  From this metro location you also have underground walking access that will lead you to closeby Complex Dejardin one of the downtown enlosed malls and also the Place Des Arts concert facility  Of course you can just walk outside up to the closeby main shopping street St  Catherines as well   You are also right next door to the Chinatown strip  Its really a great locationNext value If you have an entertainment card you can get a great price through the Holiday Inn website  I paid about US  a night plus taxes for a Saturday stay without the hassles of pricelinehotwire  I suspect you cannot beat that value for downtown stay As for the Hotel itself I had a room with a king King bed and the rooms were extremely large and also clean  Beds were very comfortable  my only quibble is the pillows were too thickfat   but I have the same issue in most Hotels   must be meThe Hotel lobby is also fairly attractive with oriental themes I can see why this Hotel is rated so highly on tripadvisor  
P => Wonderful Time on Honeymoon Hi  We just spent our Honeymoon here on      We were treated very nicely at all time by the staff  We had a fire arlam on Thur  nite about pm and the lack of info from the staff on duty was a bit disconcertingturned out to be burnt pizza but the Fire Dept  was promt and efficent  We had a  bedroom suite wBalconey overlooking Old Town Montreal  It was large with a full kitchen wbreakfast bar wstools and a living room area wcouch and chair Desk wchair  TVs  HUGE closets and more storage area than you can use in a week  All you need to bring is your table service  This is the most centrally located hotel you could find in town  We walked by most of the expensive boutique hotels and for the money YOU cant go wrong with this location Restaruants Grocery store Shops  We walked everywhere and saw everything on foot except our trip to Mt  Royal and driving around the city and suburbs  The area was very nice  We walked at all times of the day and night and always felt safe  I dont know about the people who wrote the negative review but we felt FAR SAFER than we do at home  The town is much smaller that it sound  The walks are easy to anywhere and we had rain everyday  The only disapointment was the rain and lack of a crowd to make those area that needed it alive  Many place in Old Town were closed all week due to the rain  This is the place to go to set up your base for a great visit  A GREAT LOCATION  WE WILL RETURN AGAIN 
P => Not bad I stayed here for the weekend and enjoyed it I pre paid  for the room on the HI website about  or  weeks beforehand and saved about    The rooms all have kitchens with a microwave dishwasher and full size fridge  No cutlery or dishes  There is a grocery store at the complexe Desjardins a couple of blocks away also you can park there to save some money over the hotels parking Included breakfast is fine Some others have mentioned the neighbourhood   the street the hotel is on is fine   it is just a stretch of St  Catherine north of the hotel and a short stretch of nearby St  Laurent that looks sketchy Regardless Montreal is a safe place  You shouldnt be concerned about this Staff was a mixed bag   the woman who checked me in was completely blas  the man who assisted me later was very friendly and helpful For the price I paid I am quite satisfied  
P => Id stay here again  Weve just returned from a holiday in Quebec  days of which were in Montreal at this hotel  Upon arrival we husband son and I were upgraded to a suite with full sized fridge microwave a kitchen sink and arate bedroom  Very clean and quiet the staff is excellent the concierge very helpful  Best of all was the free breakfast every morning which was plentiful and served in a big sunny room  We walked to the old city from our hotel also to the underground shopping mall at Place Ville ie   blocks and to the metro around  blocks to get to Centre Bell and Olympic Park  The only downer was the number of panhandlers we saw in the vicinity of the hotel they were always there but never in our face  Highly recommended 
P => Clean friendly and affordable  Date ch  y Maine USAHotel is clean staff is very friendly we paid  American included breakfast  Room was very spacious with two double beds and kitchette  We werent there for the atmosphere so really didnt care about our view  Parking is  canadian My friend and I needed a clean affordable hotel stay as we had appointments for Lasik eye surgery  We wanted to be close to the clinic but needed to save moneyas Lasik is not cheap  The Clinic being on Rene Levesque at  and the hotel being at  just seemed appropriate and with the other reviews and the price worked out perfectly  There is a Metro stop  canadianclose by which is very clean  We were told to not walk down Rue de St  Laurent at night red light district but felt okay during the day  Grocery store very close in Chinatown  Concierge recommended a good breakfast place called Le Avenue a bit away from the hotel but very worth it menu is in french but the wait staff speak english  Cab ride from Underground City to hotel is about   canadian  Give this hotel a try you will not be disappointed  
P => Great Deal Felt Like At Home We recently came back from a trip to Canada where we visited Montreal amp Quebec City  We stayed in Montreal only a few days but the hotel I booked there is definitely worth a recommendation to any of you travelers  If youre looking for a neat and super clean quiet hotel which feels like home away from home thats the place to be   Holiday Inn Express Hotel amp Suites MONTREAL CENTRE VILLE  The staff is very friendly amp helpful speaks English well  Check in amp check out were very fast  Indoor valet parking is available for CAD per day and service is very fast and efficient too  We left skis on the car rack we didnt have to worry about it  The suite is really large and very clean looks very new and unused  Kitchenette   kitchen furniture fridge microwave coffee maker electric kettle no utensils or pots pans though with bar stools  Bathroom   bathtub   very clean   new curtains soft amp easily absorbing water   cotton towels new massage Kohler showerhead hair shampoo body lotion amp hair conditioner products by Lord amp fair  Living room   cozy amp comfortable sofa and armchair tv internet tv games option paytv  Bedroom   so so cozy the most comfortable bed so far   huge closet tv in a bedroom  Light in the suite is very soft and warm lots of options to adjust it to your liking  arate in the kitchen living room bedroom entrance hallway  The furniture isnt tacky and is really made to use  So many hotels carry sofas or armchairs you dont even want to seat in because theyre uncomfortable  One more thing   its so quiet   our suite no  or    th floor I think had windows facing small street no view though  The continental breakfast was a real breakfast choice of teas coffee milk juices cereals pancakes choice of fresh bread toasts fresh fruit boiled eggs fresh muffins jams peanut butter yoghurts etc  Everything was delicious and fresh  Breakfast is served downstairs at reservation desk floor it looks like a little cafeteria with tv there is a whole section where food is offered as buffet  Theres also a lady to help if you need anything  I noticed they also have a gym room with treadmills etc  but we havent used it  There is no restaurant in the hotel   we had a problem with finding an open restaurant on Xmas Eve   most of the places were closed I think the hotel was recently reated  To me it looks like it was built recently  In one sentence   a great deal if youre looking for a moderate price hotel Forgot to mention the price I booked a  bedroom suite for the Christmas time CAD per night including continental breakfast   bedroom suite accomodates up to  people I believe  Once you stay there you get spoiled with the space  You go to another hotel where youve got only one room and bathroom you want to go back  We had a great time if planning another trip to Montreal we dont have to worry about chosing hotel  Check the map of Montreal for tourist attractions   its close to the Old Montreal and Chinatown within walking distance to many places metro is close amp convenient If you have any questions please email me at aga gallery earthlink net 
P => A pleasant surprise Having found the hotels I had stayed at in Montreal in years past to be booked up and others expensive I settled on what I figured would be a very economy class experience  To my pleasant surprise my room was very large with a full kitchen fridge sink microwave a large bathroom with very nice toiletries and a spacious bed  When it happened that it wouldnt stop raining the hotel had large umbrellas ready for any guest who needed one  I would defintely recommend this hotel  
P => Certainly a Wise Choice When Visiting Montreal Just wanted to say I agree with the general consensus  This hotel is in a very central location to St Catherine St Place Des Arts Chinatown Old Montreal the Latin Quarter undreground shopping and a couple Metro stops  The double room was very clean and fresh smelling as were the bed linens and towels  The kitchenette was clean but austere  There were no plates or utensils in the room  A call to the front desk was all it took to quickly get some paper and plastic plates and utensils to our room  The business room has two computers with internet access and a laser printer and usage of each was included in the lodging  I didnt take advantage of the breakfast fitness room or hotel parking so I cant comment on those  Best of all were the courtious and helpful staff  The front desk attendant gave me some candid answers to my questions about parking options in the area street parking is free on the weekends if you can find it we did and the concierge took extra time to help us find information about the Film Festival going on at the time  Total price paid with tax C  I would add to the comment made by another reviewer that the area of town is sketchy or potentially unsafe I disagree  Certainly there were some homeless that hung out a couple corners down but I was never once interrupted for money or bothered whatsoever  A surprising difference from many other cities Ive visited  
P => Hotel Great   Not too sure about the area  Cannot fault the hotel  Large room with good kitchen  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful  Also a very good complimentary breakfast The location of the hotel however was not that great  A little on the outskirts of the main tourist areas with some rather seedy looking areas in close proximity  My wife and I did not feel completely at ease when walking back to the hotel at night  Although Im sure our nervousness was unecessary  During our two week stay in Canada we stayed at both Montreal and Toronot and I must admit we preferred Toronto  
P => Great Value Pros   We had HUGE one bedroom suite  Nice large kitchen  Free breakfast in the morning  Wonderful location for going to the Gay Village or shopping on Saint Catherine St Cons   It was very hot weather and our room only had an air conditioner in the bedroom so the living room got a little warm Overall Id say for the price and quality of the room theres no where else Id rather stay when in Montreal  
P => More than pleased My sister and I stayed at this hotel just this past weekend  I chose it based on the reviews I read on trip advisor and was more than pleased  The room we stayed in was a one bedroom suite with kitchenette and living room  It was perfect There was a TV in the living room area and in the bedroom which is good if you cant agree on what to watch when you crash after a long day Old Montreal is a less than  minute walk away  I would highly recommend a little restaurand called Jardins Nelson  They have an open garden area where you can sit and live jazz is always playing in the evenings  It was perfect For Shopping St  Catherine St  is about a  minute walk with lots of unique shops  We walked most of the street and were too tired to walk back so we took the subway system which was very easy to figure out and pretty clean If youre thinking of doing some cooking in the kitchenette which only has a microwave make sure to bring some plates and cutlery  There is nothing of the kind in the room not even glasses  Odly though there was a dishwasher in our kitchenette The morning breakfast bar was really nice  Tons of stuff youll be more than full The only complaint I have is the airconditioning  It worked fine but because the airconditioner was in the living room I found the bedroom to be significantly warmer in temp  It didnt bother my sister at all but just a heads up for those sensitive to the heat Overall I would definately go back  The best part was how clean the room was  Thats always the most important and in this case there were no worries I have no problems recommending this hotel  
P => Location Friendly Staff and Family Friendly My family of  had spent  nights at the Holiday Inn Express Montreal Centre Ville on    with  beds and a kitchenette  As we arrived the hotel staff was friendly and very helpful from the time we entered the door  Location was a key factor on reserving at this hotel as it was walking distance to Old Montreal very beautiful Chinatown and Ste Catherine Street for shopping  Hotel Room was clean and AC was a portable one which was sufficient  We had asked for a crib for our dhter at the time of booking which was set up once we checked in  We also enjoyed the kichenette which made thing easier in preparing meals for a toddler  Another plus was the Continental Breakfast which was complimentary every morning  Everything was fresh and abundent  Overall a good hotel that id probably reserve again  
P => Excellent rooms at a ent price My family and I stayed in this hotel in y   We had an excellent  bedroom suite with a large TV in each of the  rooms  All rooms had air conditioning and very large wardrobes  The suite was tastefully furnished and the beds were excellent  The ensuite bathroom was also of a very high standard  The North American Continental Buffet breakfast was wide and varied in comparison to all other such breakfasts encountered on our trip although the breakfast area was very busy  The staff were very helpful and readily spoke English unlike some places in Montreal and other parts of Quebec Province  Everything about this hotel was excellent with the one exception that it lacked a swimming pool  The Hotel is in an excellent location just minutes from Vieux Montreal in one direction and the modern city centre in the other  All in all a great city centre hotel at a very reasonable price  Book early to get the best price  
P => Excellent value in a pricey hotel city  Two friends and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Montreal on y st  for one night  Our friend booked the hotel after reading the good reviews on this site  Were glad she didLocation Good location in between the major streets of St  Denis and St  Laurent  Close to beautiful Old Montreal  Very easy to get to from the highway you dont need to navigate your way through annoying one way streets to get there I would suggest when you get there you park and leave the car at the hotel  Walking in Montreal is great lots of people watching and things to see  The metro is the best way to get around  Service Our room was not ready when we first arrived around noon but they allowed us to park our car and keep our luggage at the hotel as they got it ready  We walked to a nearby place for a great lunch came back and they gave us our room key  Unfortunately when we walked in we found it was not cleaned but no problem   we called the front desk and they sent someone up to us right away with keys to a different room down the hall that was spotless and ready to go  Room Very spacious clean and nice  Everything is new  Suite was the same price as a room so we booked that   had a kitchen and living room area with a pull out couch and a erate bedroom with a queen size bed  Air conditioners in each room  Very comfortable and again CLEAN which is the most important thing Not super fancy but good for the price Breakfast Buffet Unfortunately we didnt get to see this as we didnt realize it stopped at am on weekdays  Breakfast is one of the best meals to eat out in Montreal anyhow so we made the most of it Parking Valet  a night  The Valets are great and very helpful  I think this cost is standard at all Montreal hotels I lived in Montreal for  years and saw a lot of different hotels when guests were visiting  All in all if you are not looking for a fancy place but a clean reliable hotel that is close to the attractions this is a great deal Enjoy 
P => Good Hotel for the Price Good location midway between Old Montreal and Saint Catherines Street  The concierge service was friendly and helpful from the moment we got there and the room was very large and even included a kitchenette and free internet  The only real problem was the AC unit  It was one of those indoor stand alone units and it was not nearly powerful enough to cool the spacious room during the relatively hot and muggy days we stayed there  To make matter worse it was leaking water from the condenser and the floor was soaked all around it  Still the hotel had pretty much everything else you could ask for including continental breakfast and a gym  Just dont expect any frills or a really cool room  
P => Excellent Value My husband amp I stayed at the Centre Ville e  e   at a rate of  CAD a nite booked onlne  Location blocks from Old Montreal  taxi ride from the train station  Trolley tour of the city will pick up at this hotel  Easy to get a taxi at hotel  Breakfast lots of variety fresh fruitStaff very helpfulRoom portable AC unit was barely adequate even when left running all day so it was cool enough at night for sleeping  Another unit was in living room area  When I made the reservation online I requested a king size bed however when we arrived we were told the hotel had no king beds only queen  Having the suite was very nice since we had friends meet us there and they were able to stay with us  Kitchen microwave frig dishwasher amp sink HOWEVER no dishes We requested paper plates amp plastic forks amp spoons which the staff delivered quickly  Convenience store amp grocery store Mini t is  block away on same side of street inside a dorm  IGA grocery store about  blocks away  Seemed safe after dark  Overall an excellent hotel for us and would stay there again  
P => Excellent Value This hotel had the lowest rate during the famous jazz festival in montrealwhen i checked in the room was said to be ready but on inspection was not the bins had not been emptied and there were wet towels in the bathroom from previous occupantsThe hotel cleaned it up quickly and i had no further problems again the room was cleaned well on the rest of my  night stay the hotel is next to a small park which is frequented by social outcasts but they posed no problem the occasional pan handling thats all The location is good for all the festivals right in downtown  minute walk to the jazz festival and the place de arts subway closeby alsoExcellent buffett breakfast so few hotels now offer this included with room rate it sets you off great for the start of the dayOverall i would reccomend this hotel for comfortlocationvalue and would have no hesitation to stay here again  
P => Loved the Holiday Inn Express Montreal Like all HI Express hotels the room rate includes free local phone calls and a continental breakfast  What makes the HI Express Montreal unique is each hotel is an apartment with a full kitchen coffee maker large refrigerator microwave and tea kettle breakfast bar living room with TV and arate bedroom also with a TV The hotel location is close to old Montreal and only a few blocks from the Palais des Congres convention center  
P => Great Hotel The only reason that I didnt rate this hotel as quotExcellentquot is because the walk from the St  Laurent Metro to the hotel is less than desirable if you are a woman walking alone  You dont want to walk from the St  Laurent Metro at night      I just returned from a  day stay at this hotel  I stayed in a non smoking  bedroom suite  The entire floor was non smoking and I never smelled smoke in the hallways which can be a problem in other hotels since many people smoke in Montreal  The clean room was spacious with two televisions full refrigerator microwave king size bed living room and work desk  The hotel has a business center on the first floor with free internet service and printing  The complimentary continental breakfast was good and the staff was helpful  The IGA grocery store and Complexe Desjardins shopping mall was a five minute walk from the hotel  The well stocked IGA grocery store included delicious take out meals that you just heat in the microwave  Unfortunately the weather during my week in Montreal was bad thunderstorms and rain everyday so I was not able to explore as many outdoor tourist attractions  During the summer y Montreal must be beautiful  A highlight during my trip was taking the Grayline tour to Quebec City  Quebec City was charming and wonderful On my next trip I want to stay in Quebec City instead of Montreal since you really feel like you are staying in a FrenchForeign city in Quebec City  Montreal was very quotAmericanizedquot and reminded me of an East Coast American city  The Underground City was nice since the outside weather is usually bad in Montreal but after a couple of days the Underground City feels like walking around a huge American mall that never ends     I was slightly disappointed with the city of Montreal since I didnt expect to see the many grafitti walls trash on the sidewalksin the streets rundown buildings XXX theatresbusinesses in areas that were not designated as the quotred lightquot district many of the X rated businesses are near major tourist attraction areas shopping malls etc  I plan to return to Montreal in the future but now I will have a more realistic view of the city and know that it doesnt look like the photos in the tourist brochures     
P => Dont know that the fuss is all about I see lots of rave reviews about this hotel but in my experience it was just okay  Nothing special  My family  adults  small kids stayed in a one bed suite but unlike the previous review our suite was very small and a bit scruffy and also did not have integral air conditioning  The bedroom only had space for a full double bed  Perhaps its because I paid a lower rate of  CAD ichotels internet special Even though we were on the th floor the room was noisy partly because of the location right downtown and partly because there was an area around the window where the tubing for the huge air conditioning unit which took up more valuable space was not completely sealed     and the air con unit wasnt even on so it could have been noisier The hotel is in a slightly scruffy area but it seemed safe to walk at night although we were told to avoid areas just north of the hotel on St  Catherines  The hotel is however in a good location for walking to Chinatown Old Montreal and St  Catherines the nicer part   Overall I would say it still presented reasonable value for money considering the rate I got but I would not want to pay anymore and will try somewhere else next time  
P => Excellent Hotel Im writing this while sitting in one of the suites First off the suites are BIG  Yes they are bigger than some  bedroom apartments  Clean and modern  They lack central air conditioning but have   portable units per suite one in the bedroom and one in the livingroom  Make sure you get a suite with  our first suite had only  and it was hot  degrees celcius outside  The rooms were a little smokie other rooms on the floor are smoking rooms but after a little airing out they were fine  One bedroom with queensized bed and double hide away bed outside  Big shower tub   very clean The kitchen was big microwave fridge cofeemaker and dishwasher no stove but had no cutlery  I almost think this building was built as a apartment building then converted or is going to be converted   TVs with french and english cable chanels PPV of course  Free ethernet internet weak wireless signal is present   phones  The desk service for the most part was good  One grumpy receptionist but the concerge and the valet were very polite and even tried to get us tickets to a sold out show There is NO parking around the hotel  The valet service is the only option and its secured underground according to the valet   a day  If you plan on being downtown you could probably get away without a car as the metro is walking distance  Otherwise just factor that into the price For the price of  CDN per night I cannot complain at all  The immediate neighbourhood is somewhat sketchy  Like being downtown in any large city  A few street people  But two blocks over is chinatown which is very nice one block east is St  Denis where the locals go to drinkeatparty and one black north is St  Catherines where the tourists go to showdrinkeatparty  The conference center is less than a  minute walk away  probably  minutes but you have to wait for the lights  All in all a very nice hotel for the price  I would comeback anytime  
P => Very relaxing  This is a very nice hotel  It is very clean throughout everywhere  The rooms are quite spacious and cozy very comfortable  Having a complete kitchen full sized fridge microwave sink dishwasher coffeetea maker kettle etc was terrific  I had a suite ie  main room and bedroom with queen sized bed  I was here last week for  days but would have liked to stay longer  The breakfast buffet was quite nice and filling lots to choose from  The breakfast room had a nice cozy feel to it very relaxing  You can even sit in the breakfast room after breakfast hours and read a complimentary paper in English or Francais and have a coffee or tea  They have the coffee and tea brewing here on hand all day long No one bothers you it is enjoyable Staff was niceokay they were very efficient in their jobs  I would like to make a comment on the area of the hotel it is okay not bad bad as some reviewers have said  Just use your street sts like anywhere else  TIP If you are using the Metro subway at night and you want to avoid the seedy areas when you leave the subway for the hotel then take the subway station called CHAMP DE S on the orange line  It is a couple of blocks south of the hotel you will avoid the socalled seedy area completely  Overall it is a terrific hotel I have no complaints as such  I paid  per day for my roomsuite  Breakfast is included of course I would definitely stay here again  It is like a home away from home  There is a big IGA grocery store  blocks away at a mall called COMPLEXE DESJARDINS    easy walking distance  So you can bring stuff back to your room for a snack or nightcap drink etc Double thumbs up on this hotel  
P => Excellent sevice excellent rooms excellent price best place in town I went to Montreal to attend and international conference from il  to the th   There were  professors going from my institution and I was the only one at the Holiday Inn Express  Everyone agreed that I had gotten the best deal in town The staf at the hotel is excellent Tina Pasqual and ViVi especially the service terrific the rooms are clean with a nice mattress and a soft comforter  They have a small kitchen and in my case I had a one bedroom suite with two TVs  There is free wireless internet available in the rooms and the continental breakfast even offered hard boiled eggs together with baglels cinammon rolls juices hot coffee chocolate and different types of tea There is parking available for a reasonable fee the subway is within walking distance and there is a large superket two blocks away as well as a very nice mall Les Jardines Chinatown and Old Montreal are within a  minute walk too  As everyone said I had the best deal in town since I could do my work in the room prepare a small dinner in my kitchen enjoy a great breakfast for free and even use the bussiness center Please do not be deterred by the reviewers that mention the subway stop as being near a seedy area You can almost by pass it by taking a longer route  The city is safe and the people are very nice  KUDOS to this hotle the staff and Holiday Inn  I will go back and stay there it is the best deal in town 
P => Great value for  downtown  location Pros Central Location within easy walking or driving distance of most attractions though not actually directly in any of the quottrendyquot areas of Montreal  Extremely good value considering the location price and size of the suite I was given  Efficient staff  Large recently reated rooms  suites  Free continental breakfastCons Parking is problematic  day to park in the hotel underground lot and it is valet only parking which I find annoying and inconvenient  Street parking is hard to find and parking rules are very complex  Room oration is somewhat bland and spartan though furnishings were all very new  No universal gym or weights in fitness center 
P => Excellent hotel Now called the Holiday Inn Express Hotel amp Suites Downtown Montreal this is an excellent hotel in downtown Montreal   Its location is good close to subway stations and within walking distance of the Latin Quarter fab  cafes and restaurants Old Town and the Village gay village and loads more great cafes and bars  The main shopping areas of St  Catherine Street and the train station are a couple of subway stops or short taxi ride   The staff are very friendly welcoming and helpful  The rooms are clean spacious and well appointed  I stayed twice within a week either side of a couple of days in Quebec City  Both rooms were suites the first with amazing views across to city hall both huge super comfortable beds and sofas kitchen areas with fridge freezer and microwave   The complimentary buffet breakfast was amazing   loads of choice fresh bagels fruit cereals pastries and delicious cinamon rolls yummy  In sumy excellent   
P => absolutely fabulous i was incredibly impressed with this hotel  spotlessly clean rooms free continental breakfast excellent service and fairly convenient location  for the price i couldnt believe i was getting such a nice suite i highly recommend this hotel 
P => about the neighborhood of the hotel    another reviewer notedltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltThe reviewers who complain about the neighborhood are overreacting and obviously havent done much walking around in a major city  Getting to one of the four nearby Metro stops St  Laurent requires walking past a few derelict buildings and peep show shops and be a few grubby looking folks but my wife and our toddler did the five minute walk nine or ten times once late at night after an Expos game and at no time did I feel remotely unsafe ltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltltI not only agree completely and note that identical complaints could be made about several fancy Montreal hotels e g  the Hyatt which is within a couple of blocks of one of the densest concentrations of quotcontactquot strip bars and hooker hotels in the city much closer than the Hotel Suites Le Faubourg is to any specific allegedly quotseedyquot area  Bring your family and dont worry about being safe and comfortable in the neighborhood of Hotel Suites Le Faubourg  
P => Excellent   but its changing hands We also got a great deal on Priceline  a night  The room was big w a full kitchen  They had a lot of nice extras bath salts mouthwash etc  and the service was fantastic especially for parking  For breakfast they had breads yogurt hard boiled eggs cereal juices coffee  It was a lovely spoiling experience for very little money But it is soon going to change to a Holiday Inn Express     I doubt it will stay so nice  
P => So Enjoyable My partner and I found this wonderful hotel on Priceline  We were fortunate enough to receive a stellar rate night and were so pleased with the results Hotel Suites Le Faubourg is a terrific hotel option when traveling to Montreal  It is conveniently located has a delicious and nutritious breakfast and great room accommodations  Additionally the front desk service was kind and helpful and the amenities were superb We had a terrific experience visiting Montreal and Hotel Suites Le Faubourg made it all the more pleasant 
P => I wish this was my apartment My husband took me Montreal for my birthday and we had the pleasure of staying here We took Amtrak up there great scenery  This hotel is exactly mins walk from the station and about  blocks from the old city  This hotel room is the cleanest I have seen  This place is huge  We had a one bedroom suite  My goodness it s like having an apartment  the rooms are bigger then most one bedroom apartments in NY   Very spacious arate kitchen  You can cook a gourmet meal in there  large bathroom enough space to take a bath  and even a living room  where you can relax and watch what you want while you significant other is in the bedroom watching what they want  with internet and cable access  We had a view of the old city from our room beautifulThis was a wonderful experience cannot wait to return  Highly Recommend 
P => A Pleasant Surprise After reading the many reviews posted here I expected to have a nice stay at Hotel Suites Le Faubourg but once I arrived and saw my room I was utterly surprised at just how clean and well kept the hotel appeared  It exceeded my expectations I highly recommend staying here  
P => Hotel Suites Le Faubourg A great place all around I read all the glowing reviews of this place and was initially sceptical but at US per night through Expedia I thought quotwhat the hell quot Well it turns out that the place met my every expectation and was actually quite a deal compared to some of the more expensive hotels I looked at while in Montreal Some hotels have a worn look around the edges  fraying armchairs spotted carpet scratched walls  but this place is not one of them  The rooms are very clean and nicely furnished from the handy kitchen area to the big bathrooms  There were some nice complimentary soaps and big white towels  The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal with groceries from the nearby IGA which stocks beer wine and some nice gourmet foods If you have a kid or two the arate bedroom is a great thing to have  Both the bedroom and the living room have full cable television including a number of kids channels The staff was very helpful and friendly throughout our stay and at   a day the valet parking is a deal considering it costs about that much to park in other lots around the area  You might find a spot on a distant street if you dont mind hauling your bags but there seemed to be lots of parking restrictions in the neighborhood The reviewers who complain about the neighborhood are overreacting and obviously havent done much walking around in a major city  Getting to one of the four nearby Metro stops St  Laurent requires walking past a few derelict buildings and peep show shops and be a few grubby looking folks but my wife and our toddler did the five minute walk nine or ten times once late at night after an Expos game and at no time did I feel remotely unsafe  Theres always plenty of people out and about and very few of them appear to be homeless  If youre pushing a baby stroller in this city pedestrians and other drivers will bend over backward to accommodate you  
P => Excellent suites great value I spent three nights here recently and I think the rooms are exceptional value for the price paid  The suites have a erate bedroom from the kitchenfamily rooms  The kitchen is spacious and functional   you could stay here on business for weeks and it would serve you well The rooms are very comfortable theres two tvs my room had a sunny balcony and theres a desk to work at  Free continental breakfast is a nice touch although it does get very busy down there and the selection is generally yogurt  muffins with a toast machine so get in quick Front desk was friendly  Would definitely stay again for the price around US  
P => Great suite We stayed here for a few nights in il   The  bedroom suite was bigger than many apartments with full sized kitchen stove microwave dishwasher utensils and pots with deposit etc   The staff was friendly and the room was very clean  We backed onto the courtyard so the view was rather boring  The hotel was difficult to find and we drove right passed it on the first run  Valet parking was really the only option since many streets have signs forbidding overnight parking and apparently the neighbourhood isnt the best  Would stay again if the rates were similar  CAD off season although i might try to find a place where the parking wasnt so costly night   
P => Weekend Getaway in Montreal I booked this hotel on expedia com for  USD and we stayed from Fri Sunday  I was a little nervous to see the condition of the hotel for that price but I was happy with the hotel  The rooms are spacious and clean  There is a full kitchen living room and bedroom  There are  TVs and a k even though the view wasnt very nice  The bathroom was large and the water pressure in the shower was great  The breakfast wasnt anything more than bagels cereal and waffles but it was a nice quick bite to eat that started off the day  The front desk were helpful with directions and spoke English very well  The location wasnt in the best area but you could walk to many attractions  However if you want to be closer to the bars on Crescent St  this hotel is about a half hour walk  I would recommend this hotel but if I went to Montreal again I would probably stay a little closer to Crescent and the better part of St  Catherine St  
P => Night in Montreal We visited Montreal for one night in ruary and stayed at the Suites La Faubourg  The hotel is a nice clean place with large suites much like an apartment  It was great to have a arate livingroom and kitchen as we went with our child and her aunt  There was plenty of space for  people  The staff were helpful and friendly My only negative is that it is not located in the best part of Montreal but it is definately close to everything  Its right outside China Town and really close to Old Montreal both beautiful places to see if it isnt ruary and freezing outside We would stay there again and probably will this summer  
P => Want to go right back Just returned from a stay at Le Faubourg in Montreal and want to go right back Booked this on the internet and wasnt sure what to expect but what a find Excellent suite wonderful and friendly bilingual staff and a generous quotcontinentalquot breakfast for free every morning  Location convenient for walking everywhere  Highly recommend 
P => A true find We stayed at the Le Faubourg last week and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends  As for the location the proximity of a alternate life style neighborhood really has no impact on the guests of the hotel  You have to walk a few minutes to get into what might be considered an unsavory area but walk south east west and there is no problem  A few blocks away is Chinatown where we had GREAT dim sum  A few blocks west on Rene Levesque enter the IPA grocery store for a fine treat those who love gourmet food  Continue through the back of the store to the underground mall and access to St  Catherine St  and downtown  The rooms were large with arate bedroom and sitting area  Very nice kitchen with broiler coffee maker and microwave  Spotless and the staff could not be more informative and polite  We will stay there again you can be sure 
P => Very good hotel charmless location  The good The Hotel Suites Le Faubourg is a very modern clean well run hotel and we found the bilingual staff helpful professional and courteous  On Expedia I got a rate of about  US which seemed quite good  Airline pilots and crew stay here as do lots of tourists and business types  Rooms ours was actually a ior suite are good sized with a kitchen a narrow sitting room and ent sized bedroom the bed was comfortable and there are nice TVs in both rooms yes Virginia some of the channels are even in English  Four people could share the suite but only if you dont spend too much time in the room  Our suite looked out on the courtyard so it was quiet the view is on the dull side  The windows actually open  The usual amenities are provided hair dryer coffee maker dataport etc  No mini bar and there isnt a bar in the hotel so bring your own drinks and snacks from the IGA a few streets over  Valet parking in the hotel garage is day you mightnt want to park on the street overnight  The quotContinentalquot breakfast served in the attractive lobby is quite generous all manner of baked goods breads amp bagels waffles cereal fruit yogurt   The bad theres nothing even remotely  bad  about either the Faubourg or its staff  Would I stay here again Probably depending on my finances  But if you need a romantic getaway or want charm when you walk out the front door spend the extra money in some cases  lots  of money and stay in Vieux Montr al the old city  This is because of   The ugly the Blvd  Ren  Levesque along this stretch runs through what realtors like to call a quotchangingquot neighborhood  Another guest reked in a review that the neighborhood immediately to the North around Rue St  Catherine seemed quotscaryquot  Well that depends on what scares you the three block walk up to the St  Laurent Metro stop didnt feel  scary  so much as dreary and then sleazy street people types sex video places scruffy looking clubs  Its a little better  but longer  to walk thru Chinatown to Place dArmes station or east to Berri UQAM Universit  de Qu bec a Montr al  In short its not as bad an area as some of the hotel districts in NYC or San Francisco or even Paris  Just dont expect Disneyland BTW the M tro is excellent and safe and goes basically everywhere youd want to visit except the top of Mount Royal its also  very  warm even in the dead of a killer Montr al winter shed your coat as you descend or prepare to sweat  This goes for the quotunderground cityquot concourses as well  The locals seem to like it this way  I made the mistake of wearing a sweater instead of just carrying it during one underground foray THAT was a bad idea  Quite a few of the stations are worth seeing for their architecture and public art Ive visited twice and havent even seen most of them A final word for those who having read a few of the other reviews might wonder whether Montr al is worth visiting it certainly is especially if you enjoy vibrant historic cosmopolitan cities  Theres tons of stuff to do see eat buy and enjoy no matter what your age or interests  As in any great city there are lots of beautiful areas as well as lots of ugly areas sometimes right next to one another  But its absolutely worth your time to explore even if you dont speak a word of French  
P => Great Hotel Iffy Location We spent  nights here in ust  The rooms are great    as big as many a  bedroom apartment with a full sized fridge  TVs full size desk  The room and the hotel was very clean and bright  Our view was of a vacant and not pretty lot  Continental breakfast with toaster was perfectly ent with many choices The big quotbutquot    which no other reviewer has mentioned    is the location  While it is reasonably close to downtown and Chinatown if you go north  block you are in the middle of a really unsavory ugly red light district  The sex stores the drug addicts and the extreme bikers were unreal  Were from New York and this beats anything weve got now and be even Times Square at its old time worst  Its as if every low life sin in Montreal was crammed into about  blocks  We got out of there fast with our two young sons and never turned that way again If you dont want that a block away from your hotel find some place else to stay  If you dont mind    this is a great find  To be fair we saw no trace of this blight at or in front of the hotel itself and we would stay there again  
P => Excellent Location We recommend this hotel for its convenient location and for the friendliness of staff  It is within walking distance of the Old Quarter Chinatown and many of the eateries and shops on St  Denis and Sainte Catherine  Other touristic spots readily accessible from metro stations  It is straightforward and modern and a good choice for families  The only problem we encountered was a lack of air conditioning in the main room which housed the sofabed so that our son was a little too warm and had trouble sleeping  Our bedroom had the powerful ac unit and we had to crank it up to try and help move cooler air into the other room  This would be an issue on very hot days which they had been experiencing  We did not inquire about additional help but they might have a solution if approached  Otherwise an excellent choice  
P => Great Hotel We just returned from this hotel spending  nites   Great place  Its clean the service is very good and the rooms are large  We stayed in ior suite which had one bedroom living area with a foldout and kitchenette  all new appliance and bath was good size  Hotel is a great location   min  walk to Old Montreal   minute to downtown and few blocks from the Metro  Great deal  
P => Wonderful Hotel I chose this hotel online and had no idea what to expect  The hotel was wonderful  It was clean modern and well kept  The one bedroom suite rooms were small by US standards in my opinion but quite adequate for a family  It was great having a large refrigerator  We stocked it with drinks and snacks from the IGA nearby  The breakfast was great and saved us an additional expense  I would advise getting a map from the front desk when you arrive  They will circle various areas for you so you dont wander into less desirable areas near the hotel this is especially important if you have children with you  Old Montreal Place Jacque Cartier is down the hill a block and a half from the hotel  We had a great time enjoyed the hotel and will definitely stay here again when we go back next year  
P => Very comfortable stay The Le Faubourg Hotel was a perfect place to stay during our recent visit to Montreal  The staff was friendly and helpful the room was spacious and squeaky clean and the location was pretty good The hotel is less than a  minute walk to Old Montreal after a quick walk through the colourful and vibrant Chinatown  Additionally it is very close to a Metro station that would pretty much take you anywhere The streets behind the hotel are rather quoturbanquot with the occasional coffee cup and miscellaneous trash blowing by your feet but cest la vie  If you dont like urban grit stay in Connecticut Overall the hotel is a good value  The add ons add up pretty quick  per night parking    pay per view movie    but you can easily make up for it by chowing down their Continental breakfast before you hit the town for an  crepe  Wed gladly stay here again  
P => Best value in Montreal This new hotel is definitely the best value in Montreal  It  not be located near the other high priced hotels but its location  be better  I was with a group of friends that had  rooms here  We did a lot of walking within a couple minutes of Chinatown St  Catherine St and Old Montreal  When we did take cabs it was pretty cheap  to Crescent St andor St  Laurent St for bars amp clubs  It is also situated within  blocks of  Metro stations which we used to go to Olympic Stadium for an Expos game  The suites are large and contain all new furniture  With a queen bed in the bedroom and a fold out sofa in the living area the suite easily slept the  people in our group  The suite also contained a kitchen with coffee machine toaster oven microwave stove and large refrigerator  The bathroom was similar to most hotel bathrooms  Our friends room had a balcony overlooking the street the hotel is located on   Ren  L vesque Est  There is also a large IGA superket a couple blocks down where we bought lots of stuff to stock our fridge  The continental breakfast is adequate with croissants cereals hard boiled eggs waffles and coffeejuices  The staff from the front desk to the concierge to the night manager was EXTREMELY helpful  Though all rooms are supposed to have an iron to go along with the ironing board ours did not  When we requested one the night manager came to our room explained that there werent anymore available but brought his own personal iron for us to use  Now thats service  If youre traveling to Montreal I highly suggest this hotel   especially if youre traveling with kids andor a large group andor are budget minded  Ill be there when I return to Montreal

P => Great hotel I stayed at the Holiday Inn Airport last month while visiting my parents in Montreal for their anniversary  We arrived Friday night my dhters immediately loved the pool and games area with its tropical atmosphere  The restaurant even had a terrace overlooking the pool area  We liked it so much that Saturday we ided to have dinner at the hotel instead of a restaurant for my parents anniversary The food was very good and at a ent price  The rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very friendly  I will definetely stay there again on my next visit to Montreal  
P => Repeat Stay I started staying at this hotel years ago while on business But now I only travel with my son on vacations this is the only hotel I use in Montreal  The pool amp games area keeps him busy amp the food is    
P => perfect for the airport the next day We booked this as we needed to drop our car off at the airport and catch a flight the next day  Location was fine  staff very nice  We had a nice room comfy bed  The outside pool area was also nice  
P => Try another hotel ProsClose to airport Cons  An old style motel converted into a hotel by adding a new front section putting a roof over the car park and adding a swimming pool and some plastic plants    sad  Sullen grumpy and unhelpful staff   Food barely passable poor choice on the buffet cold coffee  Ended up going to Le Bifteque across the highway for something ent the second night   Close to railway shalling yard   nothing beats being woken up during the night as trains are being put together for the following day   Fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were hanging off   No elevator although it seems they are putting one in   At night the bar has no life ended up going to the hotel next door for a few drinks welcoming staff and warm atmoshpere  
P => Good Deal  Indifferent Staff  Miserable shuttle driver  The hotel itself is comfortable and the indoor atrium with the pool is really nice we stayed here ember th  The staff however are a different story  The front desk person was indifferent and bordering on rude  I asked the attendant in the exercise room what time they closed and he told me  pm it was before  pm when I asked  When I returned  minutes later still before  pm it was closed and locked  In the morning when we were getting on the shuttle the driver scolded us for having too much luggage we had  suitcases each due to traveling with our scuba equipment  Our response was not pleasant and it shut him up however I can think of better ways to start the day On the upside their park and fly deal is excellent and the shuttle was on time and efficient  
P => Not as abad as I thought Booked this through Priceline for US all included so around CAN  I was really scared when I saw the ratings and was expecting the worse The location itslef is pretty crummy on Cote de Liesse not close to any metro station but by car its about  minutes to downtown and be  minutes to Namur Station plenty of street parking  The area is industrial well this is an airport hotel    The facility is definitely old school motel  storeys with  courtyards one which has been covered for the gle atrium seen in the hotels photos  A bit tacky but probably fun for the kids  This looks like it was last reated in the s  Front service was friendly and attentive  A good portion of the hotel is being reated  We ended in a reated room with a confortable king bed was supposed to get  double beds but we checked inn late so we managed to get a room with a king  The room was smallish as any Holiday Inn and the bathroom also but it was clean and in good shape with good shower pressure  Plastic glasses  Parking is free  A restaurant on premise offer a breakfast buffet for CAN  Priority club members receive a free drink voucher for the bar  Overall this was a ent room in a typical airport environment  For people in transit or people with car  Would come back again for a similar deal  
P => Underwhelmed if thats a word Stayed here on business needing a place near the airport  Wouldnt do it again  Hotel is dated looks like a converted motel bathroom fixtures and or were very old and no elevator to go to the second floor  Once I got to the second floor it was a long distance walk to my room at the back of the property For the money I would not stay here ever again  
P => Never Again After travelling for  weeks around Canada this was our final night before departing  Up until this time wed had no problems with our accommodation  That was until we had people come into our room at am and then again at am looking for friends  These rooms are only accessible with a door key The hotel staff offered little in the way of sympathy or compensation for our ideal and my mum and I left the city disgusted  
P => A mixed bag We booked this hotel for a one night stay while we visited Montreal The good The public areas are quite nice  The staff went out of their way for us The bad Its in an industrial area  There are hardly any restaurants and the area is comprised of a couple of airport hotels and numerous industrial buildings   Its a ent drive  minutes or more from downtown and traffic can be a problem  The bathrooms are terrible  They are small and old  The rooms are in serious need of a makeover  The indoor pool shares space with banquets and their restaurant  The kiddie pool was filthy I dont think that we would stay here again  It was just too far from downtown and the rooms did not make up for the distance  Nonetheless the staff should really be congratulated  We had a couple of issues that they went out of their way to help us with  Left and item in the room asked for directions etc  
P => Denied me buffet breakfast My husband and I checked in last y   This is a company paid training and therefore I had to take a vacation for a month to be with him and relax  The front desk gave us the breakfast stub for  month and all of my stubs has a checked k on the buffet part  Also all of the stubs has a cross out on the room   and the new room   is reflected there  In my rd breakfast day while I was eating and taking my rd bite waiter approached me and said who gave you this list I said my husband gave it to me and the receptionist did  He said I should not be taking buffet breakfast and only continental  He also asked me if I changed rooms bec there is a cross there  I said I did not change rooms  He asked me also my name my husbands name  The way he asked me questions has bothered me a lot bec it seems that I was the one who erased the room    Why will I do thatto get buffet mealsAlso it is very rude to say that I should get continental when he sees I am already eating those eggs bacon  Also why will he ask me who gave me the stubCant he check with receptionI felt so embarrassed that I left the restaurant without finishing my breakfast  I called front desk to complain and they said it should just be continental  Front desk also told me that I should have approached the restaurant mgr there and then to fix my problem  Hello I never got an apology from the mgr in duty  I went down to show him all my stubs and front desk admitted they made a mistake  Restaurant mgr and another boss called me to apologize but to my dis I will not eat in their restaurant again  I am left with all these stubs with me  And yes while I am writing this experience I am still in this hotel  I hope I can change hotel since I will be stuck here for a month 
P => Terrible Hotel This hotel is very bad  The service at the front desk and in the restaurant is horrible  The room needed some reation  They ided to close the pool at pm when it was supposed to close at pm  The parking is full of ice its very dangerous  There was a private party in the atrium till midnight couldnt get to sleep  
P => Worst Hotel I have Stayed In Candidly I expect that I wont get a good room when I book on Priceline  but this hotel was horrible  Priceline had it at  stars  it was barely   This place is allegedly being reated  and the room we stayed in needed it There were mosquitos in the room   or   AND NO OPENING WINDOWS  The bathroom had black stains that had been caulked over multiple times  There was an access hatch in the ceiling and the plaster around it was rotting and falling  The Air conditioner sounded like a train  which was good because it masked the road noise with a consistant loud noise  The only pros  the sheets were very clean  and there was free wireless internet  They gave me a free drink  although I really needed  to make this place acceptable  
P => This is more of a   Star Hotel Im upset about trip advisor not publishing my previous posting because it said I wrote to much about the surrounding city in additional to the hotel That being said Ill keep this one short and leave out the photos The hotel is undergoing major reations to the majority of its rooms Stayed for a week  Its located about km from the airport and km from downtown  I had no problems with parking and no one broke in to my vehicle Booked via priceline it was a good value but Id give the current rating as   out of   You need to rent a car if youre going to be staying at this hotel  There is a free shuttle that goes to the airport every  minutes  There is also free wireless internet access The mall which has a movie theater and numerous dining choices is located about  minutes from the hotel just north of  dont get on  its just north  
P => Awful We arrived from Barrie ON to attend the opening game of FIFA U at noon on e th  There was no one in front of me at the check in and still it took about  minutes for the clerk to start talking to me    It took  min  total to get the key  Room small bathroom smaller Sink in the hallway  Old and musty  Bathtub not draining dirty  Room on the ground floor exit into the hall on one side and onto the pool area and restaurant patio on the other  Requested more towels got them hours later  During the evening there is a party and dancing in the restaurant patio  no one mentioned it when I checked in Nice dance music but not when you got up at   am the previous morning Very loud After  calls to the front desk and numerous requests to be moved to a different room long after am we finally fell asleep in the same room  Nice setting for the indoor pool but kids reported the water to be dirty and smelly  Oh and one last thing    bed bugs STAY AWAY 
P => the slowest check in process ever It took  minutes to check in at  on a Wednesday night  There were  people in front of me and just one person at the desk  During the next  minutes a queue rapidly formed behind me The check in clerk was having problems with the computer system  Frustratingly there were at least  people visible through the translucent glass in the office behind the desk  Nobody came to help I found I had been allocated a smoking room despite requesting no smoking  When at pm I went back to the desk to get my room changed it took another  minutes to get a non smoking room Apart from that the accommodation was OK the car park had plenty of space and it was really nice that the restaurant was open until  
P => My rd stay here in as many years  As I said Ive stayed here  times over  years now and I have no major complaints  The indoor atrium is very attractive and relaxing offering swimming sauna and outdoor dining  Restaurants good bars ok for a nitecap if desired and most importantly the rooms are comfortable clean and quiet  I dont know about you but even when in Montreal for business Im hardly ever in the room or at the hotel anyway because theres so many neat things to see and do and great places to eat  So for the money I think it works OK Just a few quick things the internet connection in the business center is really slooooooow they really need an updated computer and it takes a little attention to how to get in and out of the place but other than that nothing at all You could do much worse let me say it that way      
P => Reasonable for the money but there are better options Too the previous reviewers I would have to say remember that this is a drive up two story hotel in an airport location not a downtown tower hotel and not a resort hotel  It makes no pretense at being either  It simply is what it is   fairly reasonable for Montreal accomodation close to the airport  Free parking is included  Stayed in Room  a comfortable King room with a really good bed  There were three of us and no Priority Club upgrade available because the only room choices are between two doubles or one king room  All the doubles were booked so we had a cot brought to our room at no charge Priority Club service provided me with a free drink and breakfast buffet for two The room is tired and there is noise from airplanes but other than that it was quiet and comfortable  Room service was typically expensive  for  chicken wings and I hate all the tax in Quebec but overall an okay experience  There is an indoor and an outdoor pool games area and very nice exercise room  Everything was okay After staying here I would have to say I will return to staying at the Best Western hotel at the entrance to Dorval airport    better location better price better service  The service here was okay but the staff did not make me feel valued as a guest  They did what was necessary and no more  
P => It has an atrium So that give sit a couple of points  Many rooms surround an oddly lit poolgame area that tries to make you feel like you are in the tropics  Its alright  Makes a bland hotel something  It should be relatively cheap and the kids will get a kick out of it  By the airport if youre renting a car should work out just fine for a family on a budget  
P => Si attendre h pour la navette vous pla t         
P => Attention au park sleep and fly  
P => bon rapport qualit  prix  
P => 
P => Do not stay here We stayed there on a free Priority Club night and it was terrible I booked it rather than the downtown location because I was able to book a club floor which also has access to a lounge  We checked in only a little bit early and since our room wasnt ready they ided to gave us a different room   on the th floor Wish I had said Id wait for ours and found out what the original room would have been like  There is no way it was recently reated  It had very tired looking furniture and peeling wallpaper  This room was like a cheap university residence room   and the bed had a very hard old thin cheap mattress  Nothing was mentioned about the so called quotbenefitsquot of a club floor when I checked in except that she confirmed it would be quiet because it was a club floor  It was the worst night Ive ever spent in a hotel  If this floor is quiet what are the rest like The windows dont muffle the traffic noise sirens  You can hear every toilet around you flushing and every door slamming when people come in for the night   I didnt sleep until  am In the morning I called to ask where the lounge was and was told that there would be coffee pastry and fruit   we went up at about  am and there was nothing there besides a coffee machine We bought breakfast in the restaurant on the main floor which was the only good thing about this hotel  Believe the other reviewers when they say its noisy   even if you are a sound sleeper youll regret booking it Save yourself from a bad night   book something else Did I get a bad room because it was a free night Ive got to wonder     
P => OK hotel nice Concierge My husband and I and two friends spent  nights here a couple of days ago  The location is in a busy spot right near McGill University and walking distance from the Musee de Beaux Arts  The parking is rather expensive at   per night but we had to park the car somewhere so we went for it  Our room rate was a reasonable  plus taxes for Friday and it went up to  on Saturday for some reason  We got a free upgrade to a controlled access th floor room and that was a good thing  It was very quiet up there  Our friends were down on the th with mobs of high school kids on sports teams bands and fashion shows and got no sleep whatsoever  This place seems to be the hotel of choice for low budget groups  Anyway our friends were woken up all night long by a big party across the hall  Finally the police came at  a m  and broke it up   The evening Concierge Alex was really helpful in pointing us towards the many bookstores in walking distance  He called ahead for closing times and saved us a lot of shoe leather   Our room was large and had a good city view  The floors and walls were not scrupulously clean and the amenities were somewhat meager  For example no tea and not enough coffee nor cups  The bedding was very comfortable  duvet and padded mattress topper and lots of pillows  There was only one desk chair and a table with no chairs at all  We had free high speed wifi which was a real plus  The room lighting was too dim and not in the right places so while I appreciated the free newspaper it was too dark and uncomfortable to read it at night on the sofa  We received a voucher for free continental breakfast in the first floor restaurant The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful and the food was fine but not too plentiful  It might have been better to seek breakfast at the nearby Tim Hortons  This hotel was OK for the money but next time we are here well probably look elsewhere  
P => good location   but difficult sleep I actually have one night to go and writing a review before I leave  For those who know me you know that the most important thing for me in a hotel other than location is the sleepability of the hotel  Meaning I dont care if the carpet is stained as long as I can sleep here and be comfortable  That being said I have to start off with the worst thing about this hotel the noise  As I lay in bed I can hear the occupants on either side of me  I also hear the toilets flushing and as brash as it sounds I can also hear people urinating into said toilets  It seems that the walls are made of a very thin material  In addition one night I went to bed a bit earlier and heard vacumming at around pm which emulated a bizarre buzzing sound into my room  I also wonder what others could hear coming from my room  One morning I even tip toed around as I was up very early and didnt want to disturb my neighbours   how bizarre is that  Therefore I cannot recommend this hotel and would not stay here again  Sleep is very important to me and on numerous occasions I would awake to a flushing toilet or someone coughing  One more thing and this  also sound bizarre of me to say but I think that room service is a little too punctual  Since I was here on leisure I would sleep in until am and leisurely start my morning and had room service knocking on my door at am the first morning  Because of that I used the do not disturb sign every day until I was ready to leave the room  Ive never really had to do that before until this hotel Gee this complaining stuff doesnt really sound like me so below are some pros for the optimist in meSome proslocation is good   close to downtown metro train station  lobby   has a coffee shop and a barrestaurant if that is important to you wi fi   works well here and easy to set up 
P => Nice Hotel My stay at the hotel was much better than I expected  The room was very nice and clean  The lobby contained a restaurant and a cafe which was nice for early mornings  The only problem is that the rooms arent as sound proof as I wouldve liked but other wise great cheap stay  
P => Poor value for money This hotel seems to save as much as possible  The free coffee maker in the room only offers two coffee bags and no tea at all  I called the reception and they said tea is only available upon request  The quotfree newspaperquot Priority Club is not delivered but has to be picked up from the reception desk  A coupon for a free drink means that you have to buy one and the second is then free    Bathroom on the th floor Executive was in poor condition tiles etc bathroom ameneties were minimal less than in some Holiday Inn Express places  It looks like the hotel aims at serving large groups with bulk sales and has given up the idea of attracting individual travellers  I travel a lot and use Holiday Inns at a level authorizing their platinum card but there seem to have been too many bad experiences with Holiday Inns of late  Is the chain repositioning itself for a lower end ket 
P => Much better than expected My friends and I have chosen this hotel mostly for the price and were not expecting anything special  Actually we were amazed by the good service that we received especially at the front desk  The lady who registered us was nice enough to give us a nice room on the upper floor corporate floor as they name it without charging us for the upgrade  It started well  The room itself is cozy and we had a nice view of the Mont Royal  We liked the express check out didnt have to pass by the front desk Nice week end overall and we cant wait to book another trip to Mtl and stay at the Holiday Inn 
P => Very happy The Holiday inn midtown is one of the best holiday inns i have stayed in  The lobby is very nice and the valet parking and concierge are very friendly and helpful  There are a couple of rude receptionists but the majority of them are helpful and friendly  One receptionist in particular was very rude  The entrance to the hotel is very nice and makes you feel like you are in a more expensive hotel than you actually are  We booked through hotwire and got an extremely good rate for the  nights  Especially when we had just spent double the price on an awful hotel in toronto We were touring around eastern canada and montreal was our favourite part  The hotel is in a great location and a  minute walk took you to old montreal with the ports and some classic dining  The hotel is about a  minute walk from st laurence boulevard which has many beautiful restaurants and bars i would recommend going there one night for a nice meal  We only used the metro once in our whole stay and that was just to find the best part of the underground city mcgill The rooms were bright and clean with a full length window giving great views of the city  Unfortunately the pool was closed for  days when we were there but the gym is well equipped  We didnt arrive in montreal until pm so having the restaurant and bar right in the lobby was perfect for us  They serve good food and the bar is very nice Overall i would recommend this hotel to anybody especially if you get a good rate on it You can however hear every flushing toilet on your corridor 
P => Dont pay full price We received a   discount through an online booking system and received a ent price during Labor Day weekend  The location is good   near McGill University and St  Laurent restaurantsbars but about a   minute walk to Old Montreal  They gave us a top room on the th floor with a king size bed and a spectacular view  On the surface the hotel looks quite good   the lobby is nice as well as the or  But the hotel is a bit old and has some structural issues  You can hear every sound in the hallways and upstairs particularly slamming doors  Also the shower tiles had some mildew and the curtain smelled moldy  The shower water temperature also vascillated between super hot to super cold and back again   all within a few seconds  Overall Id say this hotel is worth a stay if you receive a discounted price and are on a budget  But if you are looking for a more luxurious hotel Id spend a bit extra and try one of the other modern brands  
P => Bed bugs  We had a room on the th floor  Around am my husband wakes me up telling me he was itching all over his body  We open the lights remove the sheets and noticed little blood stains on the mattress  My husband and I then switched beds  I put the big cover on the bed and slept on top  Suddenly I feel something crawling on my face  I open the lights and there they were    BED BUGS  Called downstairs  They sent someone and she asked me to help her remove the mattress Im   to look at the headboard  funny she knew exactly were to look then I was asked if I had a sample of the bug      AS IF  We were switched rooms the next day  What a discusting hotel and what bad service  
P => Noisy doors Heard every door slam on the th floor   my bathroom was the smallest in North America and the door stuck heard other similar complaints no fan in bathroom    beds fine nice pillows    restaurant food good and reasonable prices  
P => I was pleased with my stay at the Holiday Inn I had a pleasant experience at the Holiday Inn  I didnt spend a lot of time in my hotel room so it definitely served its purpose  it was a place I could return to after a long day of sightseeing for some good nights sleep in a cozy clean bed  I also had dinner with my mom at the restaurant in the lobby  great soups and good service  
P => Average business hotel   reliable wifi This hotel is OK if you are traveling on business  The rooms are large the desk is good to work from there    but the free wifi is very unreliable  In this case I much rather have a paid but good internet connection instead but this is not available  
P => Beware of the awful restaurant   Do not eat breakfast there The hotel itself is ok However the restaurant A amp G in the lobby which serves breakfast is a disgrace to the hotel and to Montreal scene  Ive stayed in many hotels in downtown Mtl and never had I experienced such terrible terrible food  Bad awful tasteless foul coffee   horrible baked goods   Breakfast is a big disappointment basically one should expect only a muffin a yogurt and did I mention bad coffee  This is unacceptable in a city known for its gastronomy  First its not a buffet but an quot  la cartequot breakfast with about  items bagel muffin yogurt danish fruits of which you chose    At  am we were told that they had already ran out of  items  I cant believe that the waiter made a point in mentioning that our coupons covered only the breakfast not the service meaning quottipsquot  I dont know if he noticed that we hardly touched our breakfast  I suggest that you pay for breakfast at the other small independently run coffee place in the lobby   Also Holiday Inn Select in Chinatown which is only a few blocks away had a very good breakfast buffet and their rooms are about the same prices  For anybody specially families I recommend Le Gouverneur not very far either  Awesome buffet breakfast with fine bakeries lots of fruits and even more including wonderful coffee  
P => Great Value Great Location Stayed here one Sunday night as we couldnt extend our stay at another downtown hotel  Paid CAD for the night plus about  for parking  Great price   parking was steep though  Lobby very trendy and not what youd expect for a Holiday Inn Room was very comfortable   only complaint was cigarette burn k on bed spread and the light switches were all extremely low  I enjoyed staying here more than the two previous nights at riott Chateau Champlain  
P => Excellent hotel for stay courtious staff clean and restaurant is very good this hotel is at very convenient location in downtown Montreal  hotel is in excellent condition  Rooms were clean and nice  went for vacation stayed for  days and  nights   worth the money 
P => Good deal if bought on discount Definitely good deal if you pay below  per night  We got this hotel through hotwire com  I will never use hotwire anymore because the website gives misleading information  Hotwire makes you think that you are paying for a higher star hotel in a better location but you end up somewhere else  I am disappointed more with hotwire promises than the hotel  Holiday inn Midtown is a ent hotel  Luckily for us the staff at Holiday inn was extremely nice   they gave us a king bed and a nice view  We also were able to check in way before the regular time  Very kind of them  The room although a little bit outdated was clean  Our bed was very comfortable  Nice clean sheets  We asked for tea bags and got them within  minutes  The hotel is located in a ent neighborhood next to Hilton and other  star hotels  There is a swimming pool and gym and free internet in the hotel  There is a restaurant downstairs that serves American breakfast purchased additionally  The portions were really huge although the juice as someone already mentioned was watery  
P => Good location comfy room but     We paid a sale price for our room and were able to get a free upgrade to a king size bedroom from two doubles  That was nice to be given this   the new room was on an upper floor with continental breakfast included and a mini fridge in the room  The floor was quiet and the ice machine close and bed very comfy  Glad that the wifi was free  The hotel location is really good  But take note I would not pay full price for one of these upgraded rooms that include the breakfast   as the breakfast quality was really bad   even when given for free we didnt end up using the option after our first two experiences   the coffee was foul made better in the in room coffee maker the quotorange juicequot was mostly water and the baked goods were of poor quality  The room cleanliness was not great  The doors near handles dont look like they have been cleaned in months I doubt the quality of vacuuming  The other thing is that for a hotel that seems to get a vast majority of its business from tour buses they should set their elevators so that more than one works at a time  I guess it is possible that they give the more rundown rooms to the sale price customers   but still it isnt a great way to show quality  If you get a good sale price then yes this is an okay location   dont pay full price  
P => It was great We stayed here with  High school student and we were treated very well  Rooms clean  Restruant food very good and good prices  Staff very helpful  Will be visiting again with my family  Great location 
P => Good place to stay We got this hotel for  US on Hotwire  I liked this hotel a lot  It is in a good location in the downtown area  The bed linens and bath towels were excellent quality  Our room was very quiet the king bed was comfortable and we slept well  The room was large and we had lots of space  We parked on a side street overnight just across from the hotel  
P => A little datedbut quite Comfortable I was on business travelling alone and stayed  nights at the Holiday Inn  The service was quite good the room was clean if a little old and was cleaned nicely each morning  The restaurant was well priced the service was good the meals large The bar was great  There were several coaches full of kids from other parts of the world putting pressure on the staff which they handled well and the hockey tournament brought lots of young people with a party mood  I would be happy to stay here again  The electronic key was replaced  times  the only problem I was on level  which has an internet room TV lounge with fresh coffee and croissants available  The Gym was adequate although could do with a good clean  
P => happy that we stayed at the Holiday inn midtown just to let you know that your front desk staff was so nice and very polite The room was very nice and clean The location of this hotel is perfectwant to go to Old Montreal and the metro is so closeand the concierge of this hotel is so helpfull Thank you we had a beautifull stay     well be back 
P => great choice Recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Montreal Midtown with my family and was extremely impressed with the facilities and services provided  We stayed on a corporate floor and must admit the accomodations were first class  The restaurant is modestly priced and the value is above average The location is exceptional with in walking distance to everywhere you want to beI would surely recommend and will be back 
P => Great Location Now our place to stay We used to stay across the street at the Four points for our annual montreal trip  Now that we have stayed here we have a new place to stay  The staff was always helpful the bar was ent and the food at the restaurant was good  Shopping and nightlife are all within walking distance and Old montreal is an easy cab ride away  The rooms were very clean My husband recieved a massage at the quotspaquot really just a few massage tables and he loved it  Earlier in a stay we went to a high end spa for massages and according to my husband this one far outweighed the pricier version  This is a good place to stay and inexpensive    you can spend your money shopping and having fun 
P => Great Hotel in Downtown Montreal We stayed in this hotel while studying the architecture and design in Montreal  The location was great we were right in the center of the city and very close to shopping dining and the metro  The staff was very friendly and they were willing to help us with whatever they could  The rooms were nicely designed with the sink arate from the bathroom which was nice when you had  girls getting ready  The rooms were also spacious but the door did not block any sounds from the hallway  We were right near the elevator and oh boy could you hear every person getting off of it  Another thing that was kind of annoying at this hotel was that if you were on any floor  or above you had to swipe your room key in order to take the elevator up there  The keys would never swipe correctly and it could get very annoying  I wouldnt reccommend eating breakfast at the hotels restaurant because it is kind of a rip off but there are plenty of small cafes near by Overall the hotel was great and so was the city of Montreal  
P => Wonderful stay This hotel looks quite lovely and everyone there is so wonderful and accomodating  The staff is very friendly and the concierge were so sweet amp helpful  Also when our groups bus was being delayed getting into Montreal they let us stay a few extra hours in the room even after having checked out and without extra charge  Even though this is the bus companys fault not theirs they let us keep our rooms while they lost out on profit of booking the rooms out to other paying customers  In addition the location is excellent right in the middle of everything and close to everything  I would recommend this hotel to friends  
P => A ent hotel with really bad service I stayed in Montreal during y  The hotel had one room left smoking and I was desparate so I took the room for   The shower was broken and I told the front desk that I needed to shower right away for a business meeting  The front desk advised me to use the pool shower  I said give me a discount because I paid good money for a personal shower and they said no way The hotel room was clean and descent but the bed I saw was really old and crappy looking I would never stay here again because of the service but for a budget traveller then okay but if you can afford  stay elsewhere in Montreal  
P => Reasonably ent We stayed there for three nights     e   and its still being reated  The lobby is mostly finished with a rather nice dark paneled wood and ent lounge area  The concierge was borderline rude but not to the point of ruining the stay and the rooms were very ent  They were clean rather basic with two large beds with a red bedspread a small table and lamp the dresser with a TV on top very standard for a Holiday Inn and similar chains  The bathroom could have used a reno with the tub being stained and water pressure being moderate but it was not awful by any stretch  The vanity area needs better lighting as fluorescent lamps remind one of prisons and hospitals and make everyone look corpselike  There was an iron provided and a weak hairdryer  The restaurant was quite ent the food was well prepared simple and very reasonably priced  The location cant be beat so if you dont rely on your hotel for much more than sleep then its not a bad place to tour Montreal from  You can walk to old Montreal AND Schwartz and the shopping on rue St  Catherine so for us it was a pretty ent stay  
P => Good location but room leaves a lot be desired Having had a disasterous stay in Holiday Inn on King Toronto this hotel was definitely a lot friendlier and had a good buzz about it  The restaurant was very good having tried it for breakfast lunch and dinner  The location is also very good  However the rooms leave a lot to be desired  You couldnt swing a cat in the bathroom and the bathroom in our room had a big hole in the ceiling  There were reations taking place at the time so the ceilings were down on our floor cant remember whether it was the th or th floor and looked unsightly  
P => good location great price We spent  nights at the Holiday Inn Midtown over Memorial Day weekend  The hotel was very conveniently located and we got a terrific price a night plus taxes and fees plus   a night for parking on Priceline  We are Priority club members so our room was on the Concierge floor and a continental breakfast was included  Its hard to beat that value  The hotel is being reated so the lobby and entrance are a mess  The room was a ent size with a small bathroom  The people at the front desk were very nice at check in  The concierges were fairly incompetent   they could not give ent directions to anywhere  However we managed to find our way around and had a terrific mini vacation at a terrific price  
P => Comfortable good pricequality ratio We arrived at the holiday inn after our bampb had cancelled our reservation for our night in Montreal We arrived around pm and were pleasantly greeted by the valet people and the front desk staff  They were reating the lobby area so it was a bit hard to find the entrance but the staff helped us out wonderfully After checking in with the more than professional and friendly check in staff we went up to our room on the th floor and enjoyed the view and the comfort of this clean well equiped and comfortable room We received vouchers for complimentary wine buy one get one for free or beer in the hotel bar so before heading out for dinner we ided to take our ap ritif in the hotel lobby  The service was friendly and professional We found our experience at this Holiday Inn very enjoyable and comfortable  Well stay here again on our next trip to Montreal  one day in Montreal is not enough 
P => Not Worth It   We arrived around lunchtime and were given a VERY RUDE introduction  The concierge of this hotel were so unfriendly and unhelpful in addition to the incompetence that they displayed  The rooms however were very comfortable aside from the small bathroom    All the rooms ajoined  If you can park your car elsewhere because the Valet was overpriced even with inout privileges and they were also incompetant  It took FAR TOO LONG to get the vehicles in and out Nice restaurant for breakfast or lunch  Rue St  Catherines is close for restaurants and shopping and the hotel is very well located to Old montreal Chinatown and the piers  Close hotels  iott Four Points by Sheraton Quality Hotel 
P => Great Location   and hotel is being reated More than I ever expected    Booked Holiday Inn Midtown for corporate business trip and hotel is walking distance from local office so thats why it was chosen  Corporate floor with private access and  business centers pleasantly surprised on the new look on floors and rooms since i did book here last year For a downtown hotel rates are very favourable and staff is very friendly from front desk to concierge   I would definitely book again next visit to Montreal  
P => great value and location Although I am a local occasionally friends and I experience a downtown week end  This hotels location is exceptional and extremely reasonably priced  The city night life and restaurants are all with in walking distance  Im glad to see they have finally reated  Room was actually modern and spacious Staff is friendly and accomodating Really enjoyed our week end get away  Would surely recommend  
P => smoky noisy bleh  On a weekend trip to visit my brother in Montreal we unfortunately stayed at Holiday Inn Midtown  The hotel itself is in dire need of a reno  The hallways and the actual suites stink of smoke  Its near the university so the party never stops  This isnt a good thing though  At three in the morning on a random weekend not reading week or anything there were drunken kids running up and down the hallways banging on doors squealing and screeching  We told the front desk and they sent someone up to clear the halls and not more than  minutes later the kids were baaack  Dont go unless you are one of those kids  
P => Holiday Inn Midtown   a bit noisy I was here in Montreal on a business trip for two weeks and stayed at this hotel on Sherbrooke  Location wise it was great  Close to St  Catherine McGill St  Denis and St  Laurent  Walking distance to great restaurants and shopping The hotel room I had was very comfortable and roomy  For a two week stay I appreciated the small laundry facility and the very small gym  I had issues with noise though  I could hear someone across the hall coughing and sneezing all night  I could here my next door neighbor talking on the phone  One afternoon during reations the contractor was drying paint on the ceiling with a hair dryer  I can here the water pipes The hotel is mediocre but I wouldnt book there unless it is significantly cheaper than all the surrounding hotels of similar star ratings  
P => Unpleasant stay at holiday inn Okay we don t expect the best experience at holiday inns and they can be somehow depressing but functional  At this holiday inn which had a fairly good location the staff was unhelpful and rude and the rooms on one side were so loud that it was like being inside an airplane engine  Since this was a business room I had access to the lounge with complementary continental breakfast  muffins which were gone by  AM and coffee from a machine in a tiny room with one sofa and one internet access  Any attempt to get any help for a room change was meet with complete unhelpfulness  In fact the reception staff seemed poorly trained  The concierge desk was however helpful and better prepared  The overall attitude of the place seemed to be that if you could only afford to stay at this hotel then what did you expect So make your choice p m  from Munich 
P => Nice hotel with good customer service This is a nice quaint little hotel that has bags of character ranging from the rooms dining area amp staff  Whilst this is a fairly basic rated hotel the staff are what really make this hotel amp our stay very enjoyable  They were very accommoding when our party of  checked in and ensured that we were all roomed on the same floor within a couple of doors from each other The guestrooms were a good size with a reasonably sized bathroom providing bath amp shower  Toiletries were provided daily and the rooms linen were always freshly cleaned amp aired The dining area was very appealing amp they have an ample choice of food choicesmenus around the clock The service was always prompt amp there was always ample staff members around should you require any assistance I would have no hesitation in coming back to this hotel when I am next in Montreal 
P => Rather plain We stayed here     for US all inc  via Hotwire Hotel is under reation and needed it  The rooms are on the small side with claustriphobic motel style bathroom where the sink is outside of the bathroom  Beds are comfy with good pillows choice of four style upon request The gym and pool are ent but they should really get rid of the ghetto grafitti design The resaurant is a plus with good prices and ent selection  Breakfast was CAN and was copious Would go back only through pricelinehotwire  
P => Good value We stayed here for a short stopover on our way from London to family and found the staff extremely welcoming both in the hotel and the bar and restaurant  My husband I were travelling with our two  year old children and everyone could not have been friendlier  The rooms had recently been refrubished we were the first guests in our room and were pleasant enough although the bathrooms were very dated  As some reviewer commented the or is very s but it is st clean very comfortable and friendly It is also reasonably central a pleasant walk to the old town or the main shopping area  One of our main considerations was the cost   this was greatly cheaper than the other hotels in the same area While I would have loved to stay in some of the swankier places the prices were far too high  On balance this was a good choice of hotel for us definately value for money  
P => no quality what so ever Ive stayed in this hotel for  weeks  it is a terrible experience  they couldnt care less about their guests  They are careless dirty and the cleaning is just a bad joke  also you should definitely try out their continental breakfast  Its a bad joke  i wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy  they would not provide adapters for electricity they make you buy one from their store even though as soon as you leave Canada you wont need it anymore  On one day they made me wait half an hour saying I hadnt pay the bill when in fact they just cancelled my card room and never checked the bill  They did not even apologise  
P => Good Location great breakfast but needs updating  We arrived to find we were given a room on the th floor with a lovely view of the building site and crane next door  We asked to move and were then moved to th floor at the front of the hotel with views towards mount royal  It stated on the booking forms that there would be a safe and a minibar neither of these were in our room we asked at reception only to be told some rooms on the th floor do have them and some dont The room was desperate for refurbishment which was taking place in the hotel  The bed was very confortable however the bathroom was horrid it had mould and mildew on the bath tiles  The pool was cold and very dated the gym seemed well equipped  The laundary faclities were good The best thing about this hotel was the restaurant the breakfast were fantastic and really cheap and had a great choice  Would stay here again if only for the breakfast Overall there was very little to do in Montreal but im pleased ive been  
P => Good cheap tourist hotel I booked this hotel for a weekend break so was looking for something cheap well for Montreal Centre Ville anyway and close to the action  Its about   minutes walk from downtown a little bit creepy if youre walking back to the hotel on your own at night but its located close to an underground station and it is possible to navigate from the hotel to the centre almost entirely undergroundThe hotel itself is quite basic a little bit grotty but was satisfactory for my needs I wasnt really in the hotel for much of the time  
P => A surprisingly pleasant Holiday Inn experience We stayed at the HI Midtown for Grand Prix last weekend for three nights and had a very pleasant experience  While its true they were undergoing reation this did not affect us at all and there was no actual work going on while we were there  Most importantly the hotel was extremely well located just a block from the metro and walking distance to everything from Old Montreal to the Crescent Street Grand Prix fair Chinatown the major Shopping centers and more  We left our car in the garage and didnt need to see it again until we checked out  As for the hotel itself the lobby is very pleasant and modern  The room we stayed in was a corporate king which was newly reated  Rooms are smaller than US standard hotel rooms but perfectly spacious for  people with a king size bed a lounge chair ottoman and desk  Bathrooms are a bit on the small side and not updated but clean and functional  We went into our friends room which was supposedly not yet fully reated but the only difference was the furniture had not been updated yet  The concierge was very helpful in finding excellent places for dinner and in directing us to anywhere we wanted to go  The staff was very pleasant and helpful as well we couldnt figure the safe out and someone from security came up in a matter of minutes to help  This hotel is right next door to the Sheraton Four Points the riott Courtyard and the Delta  I would say its the best of the   Dont be fooled by the name HI did a great job keeping a very picky traveler happy  And the crepe shop around the corner on Breury is a perfect place for breakfast or a snack  
P => More than ready for makeover Stayed on the th floor and the room and floor has seen better ades  This is the corporate floor  The carpet in the hallway is old and threadbare  Bathtub allowed for foot bath while showering Annoying not being able to call down for car  If not reated dont stay  
P => Valet parking   vehicle robbed We stayed with our family at the Midtown  years ago and used the valet parking  Our vehicle had items stolen from it between the time the valet moved the vehicle to the garage to when we picked up again the next morning  The issue was never resolved poor customer service follow up  
P => Did the Trick I stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown with some buddies for a bachelor party  It was in a good location and the price was right  The rooms were a bit old but they did the trick  The staff were friendly but we didnt require much catering to  I would recommend this Hotel if you are more interested in the experience of Montreal than the Hotel itself and are looking for a reasonably priced solution in good location  
P => Holiday Inn   dont stay here Very basic  Lower floors extremely grungy  Hotel staff not friendly  Valet parking is terrible   you cant call down for your car and have to wait in line in the garage   what do you expect for a  star  Lots of other places to stay in Montreal   this should be one of your last choices  Food in the restaurant is horrible  
P => For the employee from another Holiday Inn How can you put down the Holiday Inn so much being an employee    you say it should not be called a holiday   why Is it because you being an employee you expect to get the pent house or royal service When youre receiving an employee rate  Which is almost like youre paying nothing  Just to inform you of what the hotel is really like a muticultural staff who all speak at least  languages and more a warm and positive atmosphere an exciting place to be in one of the most beautiful cities of the world So stop spending your vacations indoors and enjoy all the beauty Montreal has to offer 
P => Desperate need of reation Just got back from the Montreal Jazz festival and needed a convenient place to stay  If you looking for an ideal location    this place is good  Otherwise go next door to the riot Courtyard  or Delta hotel  This hotel must have been built in the s and I am willing to bet that it has not been reated since  The lobby is new     but rooms are very old air conditioner is loud rooms are dark and dingy Good luckTT 
P => A ent place to stay I went to Montreal for a conference and stayed at this hotel for a week and a half  I got a fairly negative impression from some of the other reviews on here but the hotel didnt end up being that bad  Yes there are tons of kids there  I suspect that many of them are   to  year old Americans who can drink in Canada but not in the US  To get around this you can request one of the private floors towards the top of the hotel  I stayed on one of these floors and had no noise problem the whole time I was there  The rooms are not the most modern but everything in the room worked The hotel had two very strong points free wired internet in all the rooms and a good restaurant with reasonable prices  You can rent ethernet cables from the front desk for a  refundable deposit  I found the restaurants around the hotel to be on the expensive side but the restaurant at the hotel was pretty good for pretty cheap  
P => not what I expected I went and stayed at this hotel for one weekend in ch  It was not what I expected at all  When I first got there I tried to check in but I had problems with the front desk  They did not speak very good english and I do not know any french which caused a very long time for me to check in  I waited for almost an hour  On the other hand the hotels restaurant is very good and has a nice bar  It is also very close to all the nightlife and shopping Warning when I stayed there  their was so many high school and college students all over the hotel  At night they are all loud and drunk  At one point I was sleeping and I was awakened by a knock on the door by a drunk man trying to come in who I had to call security to get away  At another point the door that erates two rooms was opened by the room next door and two drunk strangers walked into my room at  am  Overall the hotel is good for young people looking to have a good time but now for a family or a buisniss trip  
P => Thumbs up I was a little apprehensive about what to expect after booking my trip then finding these reviews after the fact  I have to say I STRONGLY DISAGREE with most of the reviews  I had a great experience and it is hard to impress a new yorker The service was impecable Extra pillows concierge money exhange room service operator I can go on and on   all were great  The complimentary breakfast is not WOW but it is free and it does the trick   OJ coffee toast and croissants what else do you want The pool is nice hottub a little small but it is nice  I got a wonderful massage by their massage therapist at a reasonable rate  The bar and restaurant were definitely amongst the cheapest and best that we found have the ribs   very good    We also got put on the executive floor and didnt have to pay for it  very nice room  ac worked fine   the walls are somewhat thin when it comes to plumbing but hey so are mine at home  The location also cannot be beat   it is about  blocks from St Catherines street   lots of restaurants shopping museums and more shopping a couple of blocks from both the underground and the metro  Old Montreal is a nice walk but on a beautiful day   very nice  Taxi to the casino  CAD airport  CAD  I would recommend this hotel to anyone   I wouldnt be wasting my time writing all of this if I didnt 
P => Stop Your Complaining People I stayed at the Holiday Inn for the long weekend in   All I have to say to all of you that are complaining about your stay  If you wanted a luxury hotel then you should have done more research  If all you plan on doing is staying in your hotel through your entire stay then stay home  I had nothing but amazing service when I was there and I have constantly returned to this hotel  I came into not having my room ready and being put on the executive floor for the same rate as my other room I booked  If you needed something fixed they came and did it as soon as possible  If you want extra pillows Then bring your own  If your going to whine people stay home   Your Drama is WAY to much about the poor and not to your par standards  Next time go stay at the Hilton where they can feed you grapes as you lie there and fan you  For those reading this There is NOTHING wrong with the Holiday Inn  Its reasonably priced the rooms are always cleaned they do not smell musty  The Air conditioning DOES work well and I can go on   
P => Loved it Great hotel very clean and quite room fast checkinout and have a meal in the Ace   they cant be making any money for the meal they give you for the price they chargeThe staff was also very helpful in locating Montreal Canadien Tickets for me too 
P => No tres bien This hotel has a great location but it is old dirty musty smelly and noisy  It needs to be reated   in every aspect  The valet service is nice but not too quick  The hotel is very large and thus there are tons of people staying there  It seemed to be prom night when we stayed and a lot of kids were renting rooms for the night which made it pretty noisy  The pull out bed we used was in horrible condition   beyond lumpy  The views are nice  The check in lines can be very long  I wouldnt reccommend this hotel  
P => go elsewhere We stayed at another better hotel but had to add a day and ended up here  Wish wed read these reviews first   I am in agreement with the comments regarding cleanliness dinginess and noise factor  There was a group of teenagers or college students on our floor that were noisy and inconsiderate and ignored requests to quiet down  It sounded like people were slamming doors all night  The blankets were thin and scratchy and the room seemed run down and not quite clean enough  I would not stay here and would not recommend it  I was so glad I only had to spend the one night here  
P => Not worth the price Room is old small dark  Air conditioner is not strong on hot days  Bathroom small dim lighting stink odour  Hotel as a whole is old dirty and not pleasant  For the price there are other hotels with better quality level of comfort and facilities  
P => Not quite up to standards I stayed here for two nights at the end of y   Depending on your luck the reception is either friendly and efficient or when they get hit as they do several times a day by groups of people checking in at the same time frazzled and hostile  My check in was fine and quick but it took me  minutes to check out because I was waiting in line with a bunch of people checking in  If you need to get a key for the mini bar in your room or if you need to borrow an ethernet cable from the front desk make sure you go it when you check in because you dont know how long the line could get if you go there later I waited  minutes to get my mini bar key and I gave up waiting  The lifts are slow and take a lot of time to use especially when there are multiple floor stops  I got a room on the th floor one of the executive floors which was supposed to be recently reated but frankly I couldnt tell as the carpets already have stains and some of the lamps electrical plugs were loose  I think the reation was partial at best and the management ided to retain some of the existing equipment  I also had a problem with the broadband connection and an engineer came and fixed it in about  minutes  Theres an quotexecutive roomquot on the th floor with free coffee and a computer for the use of people staying on one of the executive floors but the computer is old and slow it runs Windows  at a snails pace and the printer is   I couldnt believe it   dot matrix  I guess they forgot to reate that  A continental breakfast was included but the croissant was soggy and it was delivered  minutes late  The hotel is clearly geared towards group bookings and as long as those keep coming in I guess management has no incentive to make the hotel any nicer than it is or to make it more user friendly for individual travelers  
P => Not the worst hotel but       Overall I would have to say it was not an unpleasant stay  The lobby area is nice there never seemed to be a problem getting help from the desk agents or the concierge  The restaurant food was good reasonably priced with good service  The bar however had very weak drinks and extremely poor service Most days we would wait up to  minutes before a server would ask if we wanted anything and then never return for followup The fitness center with pool and hot tub was quite nice clean and never overcrowded  Had the hotel not been extremely full I would have asked for a room on a different floor There is quite a difference in the quality of this hotel from floor to floor  Some floors are quite nice with well appointed rooms If you are given a dingy room on a floor with ugly green carpet which is extremely stained from one end to the other and which smells of mildew ask to be moved right away Until those floors are remodeled I would not say that this property is up the usual standards of Holiday Inn  
P => I suppose it wasnt bad  Well I arrived around pm local time on a Sunday and was fair impressed with the external appearance of the hotel and as I wandered into reception thought quotAh nice placequot  If only it stayed that way  There were a number of problems I had with the hotel  Number one that became apparent was that the internet in the room didnt work at first and though they sent up an engineer I had to diagnose the problem myself with his equipment and even when I did he didnt understand what I was telling him  I managed to get a replacement cable from reception though so all was well  Until the service in the room started wanting to charge me several  hour charges a day charges arent mentioned at all in the brochure for the hotel and its the first hotel Ive known to charge for internet access in rooms  Next problem the window in my room was missing some sealant and so every time the wind blew which was a lot on the th floor I was given a rendition of some aboriginal style music  Next problem bloody schoolkids  be theres nothing the hotel can do about it but if you book in six coachloads of obnoxious American schoolkids who love nothing more than to ride up and down the lifts incessantly thus denying the lifts to other guests it doesnt say much about customer service  On several occassions I was left waiting up to  mins on a lift  What the hell is their problem Anyway it got so bad one time that I instead chose to as many other guests did walk up  floors over  flights of stairs in the fire exit  Next problem I dont speak French  The voicemail system on the rooms telephone systems is entirely in French with not a word of English  Next problem when the cleaner would clear out the rubbish from my room one night I had ordered some pizza in for myself and some friends so there were a few pizza boxes and coke bottles etc they would leave it lying right outside my room in the corridor for several hours before someone else would come along and clean it  Oh and the cleaners dont speak English either  I had to use primitive gestures to communicate with them as to what should be kept and what was to be thrown out  
P => What the bloody hell it smells like rotten cheese Well me and my gurls were staying at this hotel the christmas break   let me tell U Where to start Room service was horrible tell me why they would knock at my door at am The toilets contained insects and fungus  The carpet had stains and the room stunk The room was as small an an airplane bathroom The doors wouldnt clothes and my neighbour was running around the floor naked I complained but they refused to help  If u like naked old ladies I recomend u go

P => good value  we stayed in  rooms for  nights on a weekend in ember  the restaurant was very good   excellent buffet for breakfast with everything you can imagine inlcuding a hot omeltte bar  kids eat free if an adult eats as well  the service was ent but nothing out of the ordinary the halls and elevators are a little tired but the rooms are great nicely orated spacious huge bathroom  the lobby is unuusal very pretty with coi fish swimming around the pool area was nice nothing fancy but useful on sunday morning it was closed for a while when it re opened we went swimming     my son cut his foot quite badly on BROKEN GLASS  when i reported this to the front desk they expressed surprise said they would send someone to look into it but didnt offer to compensate us in any way the spa is a bit outdated but i had a great massage and it was very affordable    for  minutes the halls were pretty noisy at night  if you are a light sleeper this might be trouble  
P => You get what you pay for    Great location and friendly staff  Very loud at night fire station across the street  if you are a light sleeper it might not be the hotel for you  Also Holiday Inn should update the interior of the guest rooms and hallways  Breakfast was mediocre typical hotel buffet  If you are looking for somewhere to leave your bags and sleep this is the place 
P => Scarlet frankly they dont give a damn This was my third stay at this hotel  I noticed how tired the or was looking particularly in the halls rooms are a little better but not much We stayed in this hotel the weekend of    and had our car broken into in the garage and several items stolen nothing of consequential value unless added together cell phones CD collection etc Hotel managements response quotReally well thats weird cause we havent had any other reportsquot  I know for a fact that the items missing from the car were purchased from a shopping mall PRIOR to our arrival at the hotel  We arrived around pm parked the car LOCKED the car we checked before walking away the car honked AND the blue light was still flashing at us the next morning     it wasnt until wed driven away that I began to notice items missing  It wasnt until wed arrived back home that we noticed the items missing out of our trunk   DESPITE PROMISES THAT THE HEAD OF SECURITY WOULD BE CALLING TODAY WEVE HEARD NOTHING NADA ZERO ZILCH ZIP FROM THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT I realize they have no liability for the items stolen but they damned sure have a liability for their guests safety  Certainly not looking to have my items replaced     not at all BUT      NEVER EVER AGAIN and not cause we got robbed what the punks got is of little consequence in the grander scheme of things  Nope well never go back simply because the hotel doesnt have the BRAINS to call and say quotSORRY ABOUT THATquot and gee be we should review our security policy  There is a street level entrance that is unattended and left UNLOCKED all night long we went in that way after returning from dinner on Saturday night around  am  So yes the street people have complete access to the ENTIRE hotel all night long  
P => This hotel is very good  Would go back I stayed in this hotel from     It is ideally located in the heart of Chinatown and just   blocks from Old Montreal  In front of the hotel you will find a big subway station Place D Armes and sort of a shopping complex I arrived from Toronto at am and my room was ready  That was a big plus Blvd Ren  Levesque is just  blocks away and Ste  Catherine Street is just  blocks just the center of all the shopping and nightlife in Montreal My room was very well appointed contrary to previous reviews of the rooms being run down  It was very clean comfortable AC worked perfectly and lots of hot water in the shower  I was very pleased with the free wi fi which was fast enough  However breakfast is a solid  plus tax something outregaous for a first day meal  I enjoyed walking around and going to Tim Hortons for breakfast in the mall adjacent to the subway station If you stay in this hotel you will be pleased with everything the city has to offer just in the footstep of the hotel s door  Cab to the airport is CAD If you need any more info feel free to contact me  
P => Good Location We enjoyed our stay at this hotel  We arrived early morning by train from Quebec City and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready and we did not have to worry about storing out luggage This hotel is in a prime location for a number of major attractions   China town   Notre Dame Basilica   Old Montreal   I dont know what it is called but a fountain a short distance away turns into an amazing scene starting at  to the hour from  PM to  PM  At  to the hour steam starts coming out of the fountain and surrounding moat and the area becomes covered in a cloud of moisture  Exactly at the top of the hour flames come out of the water surrounding the fountain and the spray from the fountain seems to increase  The flames are not small and the whole experiance is quite amazing  The show goes on for     minutes at which time everything abruptly stops and returns to a normal fountain It is definitely worth seeing and something we would not have known about if we had not taken a city tour We were very happy with our stay at this hotel   however I would have to say that we were disappointed with the tour assistance by the tour desk  The people working there were definitely not very helpful but we managed on our own  
P => This hotel exceeded our expectations  Three of us stayed in two rooms for one week  There is not one thing to complain about  The hotel was updated and very nice  We were on the floor with the exercise room and pool  It was a calm quiet week  The lobby and bar area were relaxing  The rooms were clean and tended  Our bill was settled easily and accurately  The location is excellent  The hotel is across the street from the convention center the metro and Chinatown  The hotel restaurant is an up scale one but nearby restaurants abound as well  It is within walking distance to the downtown and harbor and so close to the metro that we could conveniently go to a wide range of Montreal attractions with an inexpensive metro pass  There are usually taxis at the front door as well We would stay there again anytime at the great price we got via Trip Advisor  Wireless internet was included in our room charge  That is sweet   
P => Basic hotel    AWESOME location  Arrived at this location early and they were able to get me into a room right away  I booked through priceline and was put into a basic queen room  The hotel is a bit dated however it was clean  The staff were friendly and willing to help  The one thing this hotel really has going for it is the location  It is located within minutes of old montreal  If you are looking for a basic hotel close to the touristy area then this is it  However I would recommend that the managment consider upgrading the or Free wifi in rooms but dont count on it working  
P => Will not do it again It s in the middle of the city in China Town less than  minutes walking from most of the city attractions  But the hotel is very very old  It needs a lot of reations and orations  You feel that the floor colour had changed from the numbers of people whom have already walked through  Even most of the equipment inside is really old  Plus its designed upon Chinese style so you have to be a Chinese fan to like staying there ProsLocation ConsRooms are old and give you the feeling of being not clean Hotelequipment is old Some of the stuff is not to the Holiday Inn level  
P => Location Great Hotel Old Honestly the location was idea but the hotel itself has seen better days  Easy to get around and walk all over from where it is situated  The room was old dark amp a bit musty  The free wireless internet barely worked  The gym looks like something out of an s workout video but the pool was clean and usable  We didnt eat in the restaurant and the lobby with pagoda amp water features was sort of funny  
P => A little tired but acceptable  ided to book a last minute getaway with my spouse for a Friday night in Montreal  I used Priceline and paid   all included for a room at this hotel  I probably wouldnt have booked here given the choice but I knew wed only use the room for a place to sleep  The hotel is pretty old and is looking a little tattered around the edges  Despite that the room was clean and comfortable although ours smelled a little funky  Housekeeping had forgotten to remove a bottle of fabric deodorizer and a voporizer machine from the room before we arrived  I ided to unplug the machine not wanting to breathe whatever chemicals it was spewing into the air only to have the room smell musty by the end of the evening  As it turned out someone had left a window open during a rainstorm and the carpet beneath the window was soaking wet  The hotel should have vacuumed up the carpet and installed a proper dehumidifier and industrial fans to dry out the room rather than try to mask the odor  Aside from that this place is in a great location right in the heart of Chinatown and a couple of blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral and the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal  For the sports minded traveller the bike path that runs for miles along the Lachine canal is a short  meter jog from the hotel  Free wi fi in the rooms  
P => Good hotel in the heart of Montreal near Vieux Montreal  minutes walking distance from Vieux Montreal this hotel lies directly in Chinatown district  The hotel is comfortable the rooms offer plenty of space only double beds in family rooms and are very clean  Nevertheless the hotel needs some interior reation  Please make sure to reserve guaranteed space in the underground parking lot which unfortunately is with costs  Noise level from near road is acceptable  
P => Adequate Conference hotel but in need of a refurbishment This hotel was perfectly fine  I stayed here for  nights while I attended a conference across the street at the Palais  The convention rate was nearly  dollars a night including tax  I paid less than  dollars a night as I purchased on a pre buy deal from a website called hotels  While well worth it in the  dollar range it was incredibly over priced at  dollars The rooms were fine but I think this hotel is in need of a major refurbishment  The TVs are outdated and they had very few channels  While I requested a fridge it never turned up and by the time I called again they had run out  For some reason there were only  hangers in the closet and the towel delivery was hit and miss  Some of my conference colleagues complained of similar problems  It was a little shabby The lobby area was very pretty  I didn t try the restaurant due to previous reviews  The gym was okay but cramped  The guest washer and dryers worked fine and only cost   for a load  Good shower clean with comfortable beds It is a lovely location especially if you love Chinese food like I do  It was an adequate hotel for my needs but not very sexy  
P => Great location The Holiday Inn Select is just around the corner from Chinatown next to the Palais des Congres and near the Old Town  There was lots to see and do within walking distance The room was fine the beds were comfortable the lobby has a kind of cool fish pond and the breakfast buffet was okay for a breakfast buffet  The parking garage is pretty seriously creepy  We were very happy with our hotel choice  
P => Think twice This hotel is very close to the downtown BUT it is very old it smells badly and most certanly is not worth the price   you would be better off booking a bit cheeper or bit more expensive hotel  The parking and elevators are also in terible condition  Think twice before booking this hotel  
P => So So Property Good Value GREAT Location This is a hotel that is looking a bit run down at the heels but is acceptably clean  The location however is superb a very short walk from Old Montreal Notre Dame Basilica Cirque de Soleil restaurants etc  We began our stay at Le Phillips Square overpriced and poor location then moved to this hotel its half the money and twice the location  
P => Nice Hotel for the money    GREAT LOCATION When we checked in we were given a room that had problems with the air conditioning   and the beds in that room did not look near as nice as the room where we were transferred to   which had much better air conditioning   needed in late e THE LOCATION OF THIS HOTEL WAS IDEAL   Blocks away from the Old City   right across the street from the Metro station   and the a BIXI stand    you can rent bikes for  a day and drop them off ALL OVER MONTREAL    and then pick up another bike at the same or different stand    ALL DAY LONG       The Holiday Inn was in Chinatown    and it was only about  blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral    the LOCATION WAS GREATPeople who worked there were friendly     the People in Montreal were friendly   did not have a bad meal or food the entire time  I recommend the jardin botanique and just walking around Vieux Montreal    Cirque Du Soleil and the Port was not far away either     
P => The hotel was in the perfect location for us  It is on the edge of Chinatown and  blocks away from Old Montreal  We had a great time walking and walking in Old Montreal  We went to Chinatown and I had my name written on a stamp by a calligraphy artist so that I can stamp my artwork like Chinese artists do  At the flea ket in Chinatown we picked up an umbrella and a sun hat for a few dollars  I did not care that much for the food and prices in the hotels restaurant  However sometimes we called room service and shared meals  The quality of the room service food was good  In fact it looked nicer and more generous than what we saw in the restaurant  I would stay there again  The staff was helpful when my wallet was stolen  
P => overrated for the value Lobby is on nd floor pictures on website is overrated The minute you walk in and all throughout the hallway and room the stench is of a cheap and dirty restaurant  You know right away you overpayed per night booking  Do not stay here even it is night  
P => Really nothing special I was supposed to stay for  nights but I ided to go to the Holiday Inn Midtown instead for the rest of my stay The reason I changed hotel was mainly because I am concerned about the environment and it looked like this hotel isnt doing much effort for that They have huge ventilation noisy as hell in every corridor  Is it really necessary in The temperature outside was never above     The AC inside the room was very noisy too and unneeded but impossible to stop The breakfast was ok  Or pretty good I should say There is a parking underground  Around  I went away because for some reason I didnt like the atmosphere  be I got fooled by the SELECT term  To me i sounded like it would be better than a typical HI  But it actually means that there is something special about it  And here it was a Chinese Theme HI The hotel is at the entrance of Chinatown The location is good  In between the old town and the busy street of St Catherine  There is a metro station nearby  
P => Recommended We stayed here for  nights and although as others have said quota bit datedquot we found it to be good value  All staff were helpful and polite  A problem with breakfast vouchers was resolved with out any fuss at all  The concierge was very helpful and extremely polite a rareity in some more expensive hotels This is the second time we have stayed here and would again  
P => great time This is a great hotel for location and many other reasons   It is close to the Palais de Cobgres and Old Montreal  Also not far from the downtown area  Great staff great rooms Try to get the top floor  Great buffet breakfast   Pierre the congiere is amazing  All the staff are so freindly and will do anything for you    Get a good price and you will love it   We have been there  times   
P => Clean witha Great location Stayed at the holiday Inn between x mas and new years Location was great Walk to old montreal and st catherine shopping walk to subway and under ground pathways Rooms where big and clean The pool and the hot tube were the only down side and just because we were stuck inside one day due to freezing rain Would stay again  
P => Dated but presentable The hotel is orated in Chinese style although the or itself is dated  This is clearly an older property  Well you can say its a unique style for a Holiday Inn anyway  Dusty reproduction Chinese vases from the s lurk in dimly lit alcoves everywhere  My only complaint is that the light by the bed was switched from beside the front door and shared a circuit with the front door ceiling light  You needed the switch on and the ceiling light on to control the bedside light Switching off the ceiling light caused the bedside lamp to be inoperable too  And the bathroom light switch was behind the bathroom door  Strange  Indoor parking was nice in the winter and easy to use  simply stop by the front desk on your way out to get the card from the machine validated  Access to and from Highway  was easy I ate in the restaurant once  It was not great you could do better elsewhere  Food was a little salty and oily  be  stars  There was some noise transmission through the wall from the next room and faint mechanical noises emanated from somewhere overhead  But I had quiet neighbours so all in all it was a quiet stay  Im not wild about this property but overall it was inoffensive with no really glaring issues so I suppose that Id stay here again  Certainly wouldnt go out of my way for it though  
P => Very Bad Value   Stuck in  From staying in Montreal at quot starquot and quot starquot hotels on  erate occasions I have come to the conclusion that a ent hotel room in this city is just too much to ask for  My most recent experience was at the Centreville Holiday Inn and I will never be staying at a Holiday Inn again  I called ahead and requested a non smoking room on a high floor which I was granted  We arrived at pm having driven  hours from Toronto and were told our room was not ready  Ok thats fine hotel policy states that check in is at pm but be they could have made an effort to re assign our room to an empty one  The hotel was definately not full this weekend  The room itself was musty smelling and the or tv and furniture is stuck in   The comforter was old and tacky looking why not just get a washable duvet type blanket that most modern hotels seem to have these days The pillows were way too thick and as a result I did not sleep at all either nights  As a result I had a migrane and sore neck the whole weekend  Both mornings at am I was startled by an extremely loud noise coming from the floor above hammer drills  Said hammer drills did not stop until late evening and you could barely hold a conversation with someone in the room let alone watch tv  Apparently the hotel is reating the th floor  For the price you can probably find something much much better than this Try the delta riott sheraton or even best western  The one good thing about this hotel is the location as it is close to old montreal and the downtown core  
P => Perfect Location We stayed only one night at this hotel t   The location is great just a couple of blocks from the Old Port and right next to Chinatown  Take the opportunity to explore Chinatown and check out some amazing food for great prices  The room itself was clean esp  the bathroom  Free internet was great in helping us find our way around  Parking was convenient and for the  you arent going to find much else for less  As for the other reviews on this place being quotunsafequot you are in a city be wise about your actions 
P => The good and the bad HiI am an American who stayed at the Holiday Inn in Chinatown on the Labor Day weekend as part of a wedding party all the out of town guests stayed at this hotel and got a special rate I thought the rate as compared with American hotels in major cities was fantastic  however the food in the hotels restaurant was over priced  When I complained about anything not working in my room or asked for anything it was taken care of immediately I was disappointed however that there were no free computers available as Ive had in other hotel lobbies I didnt go to the indoor pool but other wedding members who did go told me the water was cold  Ive never heard of an indoor pool before that wasnt heated There was a coffee maker inside the bathroom as many hotels have and also sadly as many hotels have the part where one must put the coffee was filthy  
P => Great stay The location of hotel was fantastic and very close to shopping and Old Montreal  The interior was clean the bed was comfortable the furnishings were nice the service was great the breakfast buffet was good with hot and cold options and lots of fresh fruit and the room was large  I had a fantastic stay in this hotel and would use this hotel again  
P => Kitsch but cute We really enjoyed our short stay at this well located hotel in central Montreal  The s Chinese style lobby is kitsch but cute and the kids loved watching the goldfish swim around the walkway between the reception and the dining room  The room was comfortable and spacious  The indoor pool was an added bonus  We were pleased with the friendly service and great breakfast buffet  If youre still feeling hungry dont miss the opportunity to have excellent dim sum at the nearby Maison Kam Fung restaurant 
P => not safe  hotel is a little old and worn looking  No refrigerator in the room   Safety is an issue you can access any of the floors of the hotel from the public parking lot underneath it  My car was broken into and my kids lost an ipod a lap top and a DS  I believe that we were being watched as the stuff was in the car less then  minutes  There is a mission across the street and people sleeping on the streets very close to the hotel  Not safe  The staff were not very sympathetic and pretended to be so surprised that we were robbed  Yet reading these reviews I can see that we are not the first  If we go to Montreal again we wont be staying here  
P => Nice Hotel Driving in to Motreal on good luckpicked this one because its very close to the harbor and the old city  Nice and clean room plus very nice bathroom Absolutly recommendable 
P => Good location   very poor security Probably the best thing going for this hotel is its location    min walk from most of down town Montreal  Probably does need a general renevation in some areas including all the common hallways  The free internet was down for  of the  days I was there  Everything else worked but as previous reviewers have noted it is dated However the one thing travellers should be aware of with regard this hotel is that reception is on the second floor and you can access all the other floors directly from the lift  elevator without going through reception  I didnt realise this this until I retuned late one night  am  This is a serious security lapse for any hotel   Im sure they will give some excuse about CCTV coverage but that will do you very little good if you are followed in off the street and mugged in your own corridor  very badly lit so CCTV would be useless anyway or even your room by a stranger  Therefore if you are female travelling alone do not stay in this hotel the risk is too great  Otherwise be very careful when you answer your door to room service or cleaning staff  Also I wouldnt leave anything valuable in your room at all  Plus Montreal police are not known for their effeciency in dealing with tourists who dont speak th century french which is effectively what they speak in Quebec  Ive worked there with an ex Parisian police officer and even he had a hard job figuring out what people were saying and you will find many people  even those    cannot speak English at all In my experience even the French speak more English  
P => Back to the s This property is located in chinatown Montreal so the location is convenient  I was given a room on the Priority traveler level   I am embarrassed for them that they would offer this room to priority business travelers  Carpeting is old and smelly other than at the entranceway there are no light switches so you must walk to the lamps to turn on the lights the mould in the bathroom was awful and the sink and shower drains were not draining so I asked for another room for the next night  Carpeting and bathroom was not much better but at least the sink drained properly  Surface was not wiped down from previous guest and the furniture is very old  The front desk seemed more bothered to have to look for a second room for me instead of apologizing for the problems in the first room   in fact the two people I spoke with didnt even want to know why I wanted to leave the first room  The equipment in the fitness centre has  bikes from the s one treadmill that needs servicing and one stairmaster that needs to have the chain oiled so loud when in use  Its unfortunate this Holiday Inn property is not well maintained given the location and brand name  
P => Strange but Serviceable  Take it at the right price  This is one of the strangest hotels I ve ever visited especially considering it s part of the usually very standard uniform Holiday Inn chain  It s not bad  In fact it has some good qualities  But it s STRANGE First of all the architecture it s a combination of modern socialist block and Chinese palace overall one of the ugliest hotels Ive ever seen  The outside yellowish brick is worn from the Canadian winter yet the Chinese facades on top are colorful  The lobby is pure kitsch   a pagoda and pond with goldfish surround the pretty good bar and often closed Chinese restaurant  Carpet at the entrance and into the lobby is gritty and worn  The lobby is on the  second  floor so don t be put off by the convenient yet somewhat odd collection of merchants on the entrance level a convenient mini grocerysouvenir shop and a host of shops devoted to the Chinese community the main avenue of which seems to be on the street directly behind the hotel  Just head for the elevators by the  really  kitschy Chinese quotwaterfallquot  The rooms standard Holiday Inn if a bit worn especially carpets   but I noticed in my walk through that the lower floors seemed to have newer carpet     you might ask  Large and serviceable   ours had a nice mini fridge and nice view looking right at downtown Montreal  Bathroom was large and clean with nice toiletries and a very good shower  Heat worked well despite the bitter cold  Housekeeping was particularly good   a request for an extra blanket rendered a very nice new duvet  and  an extra blanket  Good bed and pillows Staff was really good     knowledgeable and instantly responsive  I requested a room on a high floor with a view and got it without hesitation  Concierge knew the city very well Location is really good     very close to the old city and directly across the street from a metro stop which is part of the famed Montreal  underground   There is a  type store and a Tim Horton s which has great cheap food especially breakfast about  minutes away     just go in the door next to the Metro  We got a really good price so it s hard to complain about anything  But just keep in mind this place is quite odd 
P => Great Location The hotel lobby is on the second floor along with a restaurant a bar  It was always seemed quiet and deserted  There was a gift store on the street level however it was never open early or late  Our family of four had a room with two queen sized beds large bathroom a erate sitting area with a small table and two chairs which left lots of room for our luggage  The room was attractive looking clean and mostly quiet  The heater in our room was noisy not white noise but uneven noise as if it were struggling  We left it off at night and then turned it back up in the morning  The hotel is beside Chinatown and a short walk to the Old Montreal area  The metro station is across the steet at the cost of   for  yrs and up  If you are going a short distance such as to downtown shopping area the cab fare was    Cabs were always available outside the hotel  I would stay here again because the price was  a night and the convenient location  
P => Enjoyed Our Stay We stayed at Holiday Inn Select t      taxi driver from airport knew exactly where the hotel was located and took about  minutes to arrive  Check in was smooth and easy  Front desk informed us the Metro station was located just catacorner to the hotel inside the Convention Center  The street level of the hotel has a very small store stocking assorted sundries souveniers drinks and snacks  Our room was large and serviceable about what youd expect in a Holiday Inn  Bathroom was quite large  Functioning minifridge desk and upholstered chair  ACHeat was pretty loud but functioned well  TV included both USA and Canadian channels  Our view was of the inaccessible rooftop pagoda which is supposedly a replica of a former Emperor of China  We dropped off our bags and ventured out to Vieux Montreal about three blocks away  Tip Cross the street towards the Metro station as the streets are one way and can be tricky to avoid traffic Mornings were quiet  A few newspapers were provided by the elevator bays  Only six or seven though so snag one early if you want oneProximity to attractions is nice  Hotel is located just on the edge of Chinatown which provided a nice walk through  We used the Metro often and loved how easy it was to get everywhere  Another tip Tim Hortons restaurant is located in the Metro station  Very inexpensive under  each and filling  We made a habit of stopping by the hotel bar every night on the way in from our excursions  The bartender was cordial if not overly friendly but provided light snacks metro maps and helpful city navigation Late check out was asked for and granted  Although many people must have asked for late check out as when we came downstairs at  the front desk was manned by one person and swarmed  However many apologies were forthcoming and they offerd to hold our bags for us for a few hours while we took a final walk around Vieux Montreal  We accepted and our trip ended on a lovely note Very basic hotel  No frills  If you are looking for charm go elsewhere  But if you just need a place to sleep this place more than fits the bill  
P => Holiday Inn Select Montreal Centre Ville This hotel was good for what we wanted  It was close enough to everything that you could walk to almost everything  There is also a metro stop across the street  The hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful  My only complaint is that the hotel is on a moderately busy street and the traffic noise can get annoying  
P => Great Hotel Beautiful or   very clean   wonderful location and the best staff weve ever encountered at a hotel  They were friendly and extremely knowledgable   this was our first trip to Montreal for my boyfriend and I and we cant wait to return back to this amazing city and hotel  We paid  for a huge room with King size bed and we were in walking distance of everything in Old Montreal   LOVED IT 
P => Ideally located Great stay Just spent a few nights with my friend for a Mommy Shopping Getaway in Montreal and it was greatEverything went well from the time we walked in to the hotel to the time we left  Our room was clean and spacious  We had breakfast in the restaurant and the service was good the waiters were friendly and also helpfull with stuff to do around the city The hotel is well located to shop and visit the city  The staff was extremely helpfull in showing us how to get around town and was a must see or a skip  Lastly the Spa is simply AMAZING and well worth a visit We will definitely return next year if not sooner for another getaway  
P => Great location    Nice hotel clean room great pillows and unique lobby with the indoor goldfish pond  Great location   walking distance to Old Montreal and shopping on St  Catherine St  The only thing   my car was broken into in the underground parking garage at the hotel  Make sure you dont leave anything in your car 
P => Holiday Inn Select Montreal Went to Montreal to see Rush play at the Bell Center on t    Stayed from the th to th  My two nights were average no complaint no compliments really just what an average stay should be  It is located close enough to all the downtown places and I must say that Montreal seemed busy at all hours  My room was on a non smoking section and also had a note about no loud noise overnight which was cool  Parking was the only issue  I found a spot but the underground garage is quite tight and doesnt seem to have too many spots so I left the car there and walked when needed  It did say that the hotel validated parking but still charged you so that was confusing  Validating to me meant that if you stayed at the place it was free  Parking was  a day I believe wow  So all in all the place was fine clean and acceptable and close enough to walk to stores and restaurants even the Bell Center which is about a mile away  
P => needs reating We wanted a hotel in Montreal for one night with a swimming pool near the airport where we could stay with  small children and this was what the travel agent found for us  It was not near the airport but just outside the old town at the entrance of China town  The lobby area is nice chinese theme the staff was nice the rooms are ok but not extraordinary The swimming pool is terrible without the kids I wouldnt have gone into the water which really did not look very clean and it really needs some reation as the rooms as well Breakfast was ok I would not return there  
P => Very nice  Situated in Chinatown steps away from Old Montreal   this hotel is very nice  like all other Holiday Inns Ive stayed before  The reception staff are courteous the room is very spacious amp clean even the bathroom  They have free wireless internet connection too  
P => Nice hotel in the center of everything We have stayed here twice and will definitely stay here again because it is a nice enough hotel in a great location  We like to go all over the city so the  minute walk to the metro is ideal  I like the Asian theme throughout the receptionlobby area and the close proximity to Chinatown for excellent Chinese food go around the corner to the Beijing Restaurant  We are Priority Gold members at Holiday Inn so the service was excellent  they even called us twice to ask if we needed anything during our stay  We stayed on the eighth floor with a view of the city which was very nice  based on other reviews I would try to get a room on an upper floor with a city view because apparently some rooms just have a courtyard view  Underground parking is convenient and the fitness center is small and old but is useful  There is wireless internet in the room The negatives include the small pool and spa that seemed to always be filled with people and the room or is slightly dated  We also awoke two mornings in a row to a loud vibrating sound that was coming from the pipestoilet in our bathroom and the housekeeper also tried to come in twice at  a m  and  p m   We mentioned these interuptions to the front desk at check out and they immediately offered to refund our entire parking charge about   We also kept the privacy tag on the door on the second day and were never bothered by housekeeping again If you are looking for elegance or luxury this is not the best choice but for convenience and comfort this is a good choice  
P => Excellent Hotel Stayed here for  nights and were very happy with this hotel  Check in was fast and we were asked if wed like a king size bed instead of the queen we had requested  The room was spacious clean and very comfortable and the power shower in the bathroom was great  Hotel is in a good location right next to Chinatown and a short walk to Vieux Montreal for Notre Dame Basillica etc  We had the cold breakfast buffet you can pay extra to have the hot selection but we were quite happy with the continental selection which offered cereals fruits toast cheese ham danish pastries yoghurts juice coffeetea etc The lobby is very nicely orated in an oriental theme and has a lovely water feature with fish next to the dining area  The hotel offers free wireless internet access  Underground parking is available beneath the hotel with inout access included for  per night and the Metro station is right across the road Overall we had a very pleasant stay and would definitely stay here again if and when we return  
P => great location Metro right across the road four minute walk to Notre Dame and Old Montreal and is located in Chinatown We arrived early and the front desk staff were able to find us a room that was ready  Room typical for a Holiday Inn  Pool area was small but nice and it is well used by guests therefore making it more crowded than I am used to for a hotel pool Underground parking lot is interesting to say the least and was difficult to manoeuvre our van   wouldnt want to go in and out each day  
P => Great value Its a great value for the price  The buffet breakfast in the morning is amazing  The hotel itself needs a bit of modernizing but I was comfortable nonetheless  I will stay here again  
P => Easily located to the Old City and Metro This hotel is located at the corner of Montreals Chinatown and a block from plenty of Chinese restaurants across from the Metro   Place de Arms a bus stop and a couple of blocks from the Notre Dame Cathedral and Old Montreal which allowed us to walk to many of the restaurants and sites of Old Montreal and along the river  The room king size room was roomy with a sofa bed and plenty of storage space  The bathroom was equaklly roomy  The room and hotel were well maintained and clean  
P => perfect spot in downtown montreal My wife and I along with are  mouth old boy went to this hotel and it was very good the people were very helpful with finding things to do also everyone spoke perfect english so if you cant speak french its ok the only time we ate at the hotel was one morning we had the all you can eat buffet breakfast its was exelent lots of fruit and eggs beacon they even had these apple with cream cheese crepes they were awsome  again the waiter was so friendly had gave us ideas of where to go and see while in montreal   The hotel is located right beside downtown with subway metro access right accross the street so if you want to travel around the city with out useing your car this is a perfect location also one street west is chinatown id admit at first i wasnt so crazy about staying beside chinatown but it ended up being an exelent turn of events as we had one of our best meals there and at a very resonale price   you are also located beside old montreal which we found to be very beautiful part of the city if your looking to buy beer or wine there are places close by we also ate at st hubert there specialty is rotisory chicken abd it was awsome also I sugest eating there if your on a budget because the prices are very good  The only bad part of our trip was that it was very cold and we ended up travel on foot in the undergound city that montreal is famouse for and im going back in the summer to walk and see some more of this beautiful city  overall this was a last minute disision to go to montreal and it ended up to be more than i expected  Hotel has some intersting history abut it also there is pool with jacuzzi or hot tub and wieght room if you want ot do a workout   The room was large and the view of the city was spectacular try to get a room on the eight floor as we did its non smoking  The or is chinese with lots of plants and steams with goldfish in it surounding the resturant and lobby  I will be coming back to this hotel agian forsure in the summer just for the location alone   
P => Average Montreal hotel in good location  Stayed at the Holiday Inn Select Montreal Centre ville after getting a great same day deal on Priceline  Checked in quite late around  pm after visiting a friend  I wasnt expecting much but it didnt really matter as it was a place to sleep since Id be out of there the next morning  RECEPTION The clerk who checked me in mentionned that the room was pre paid but nothing more  He did not ask about bedding preference but I asked If it was non smoking and he said it indeed was  Thats what mattered most to me  ROOM My room was on the th floor overlooking a sort of tiny courtyard  It was very quiet  I agree with previous reviewers the hallways are dark and certainly not very quotFeng Shuiquot but the room had a certain Asian feel to it  Carpets looked pretty new and clean  The furniture was in good repair but once again I will echo previous comments and say that they could use a change  It was pretty scratched and definately more s ish  It appears to me as If they changed the carpet and the tapestry but didnt bother changing the furniture when they last reated  The bed was not up to par to most  star Norh American hotel these days that have fluffy duvets and pillowtop mattresses  Quite a few other hotels in Montreal charge similar rates the Quebec government gives them a  star rating yet most other chain hotels in the city have superior bedding next to it location wise and it the same star category on Priceline the Hyatt comes to mind but they are like day and night  Therefore the bed and pillows were ok but not great  The bathroom is also of the older generation hotel bathrooms vinyl countertop pink tiles etc but perfectly adequate with excellent water pressure and top notch cleanliness  Towels were threadbare though  The AC unit was quiet and didnt disturb my sleep  Housekeeping respects the do not disturb sign  Other than the room and check in I spent so little time in the hotel that I cant comment on food or the pool facilities  All staff I came in contact with provided prompt service  The lobby has nice water gardens with ponds and such but same thing as the room the furniture is very early s and could do up with a change  Its clean though My thoughts A good rate direct with the hotel is below  If you do not qualify for any discounts  Priceline If you get it at  or below its a good or great deal  Clean quiet and well located  If you like Asian food youre in the right location Plenty of excellent restaurants within  minutes or less from the entrance and theyre all cheap Convention centre is right in front too  The shopping is within walking distance and so is Old Montreal and the Gay village  Might want to take the orange line subway which is a  minute walk away inside the convention centre to Mont Royal and the Plateau unless you like long walks uphill  
P => Terrible and irritant A wrong begin by chek in  our nonsmokig room was reserved from one day to early so at our arriving we didnt get a room After  hour discussion we got a smoking room at de th floor terrible stinky A double room with a smal bed to big for one to smal foor  persons with bad towels for one person Next day by protest we achived a nonsmoking room at the th floor with a window with bidirectional wieuw at de bar and longue perhaps is an unique dream of an exhibitionist Warning for persons with claustrofobie without daylight  Just a prisoncel   People whoe are looking for a minimal  star hotel Holiday Inn in Montreal is NOT an alternative I shal it do never again    
P => Average Montreal hotel Just an average  star hotel  A bit pricy for what you get  I stayed there during Christmas Holidays  Some American guests were extremely noisy one quotladyquot was even running in corridor naked  Eventually I called the front desk and security arrived promptly  They were quite nice and encouraged me to call again if there were any problems The room itself was acceptable but I was expecting more for that price The Chinese restaurant quotChez Chinequot is absolutely great But this is the only pearl    the rest is pretty ordinary and I dont think I will stay there again  
P => Quite Disappointing Stayed at the Holiday Inn for  nights in ember   Good location if attending a tradeshow or if you want to visit Chinatown Hotel itself is quite disappointing  Although it has a nice lobbyrestaurant area the rooms are very old and dingy looking  The indoor pool was small and is certainly not cleaned on a regular basis  Overall service was average nothing spectacular  I wouldnt grade this hotel with more than a   star  
P => Cant beat the value for the location My experience here turned out to be better than those of the rather mixed reviews here    not that I had any choice as my employer assigned me here for our conference from  to   The front desk was friendly and efficient as I checked in five minutes after my pm arrival  I had hoped for a king bed but the double queen accomodations I was given at least allowed me a convenient place to throw my things after a long day I often stay at Holiday Inn when I travel for pleasure so I knew what to expect and I was otherwise okay with the room  It did seem recently reated and the bed I slept in had comfortable which for me means moderately firm mattress and pillows  While the bathroom had a lot of counter space it also had a shower drain that would not close  As I was looking forward to a soaking bath after a long first day I contacted the front desk who promised to send up maintenance  They never showed but as I felt better during the rest of my stay I did not make an issue of it  Housekeeping was good especially in how they arranged the mess of my toiletries I had in the bathroom  LOL I mentioned this when I left my daily  tip in appreciation and I returned to see a more premium soap in my dish Probably the best thing about this hotel is the location  I had a nice view of the Palais des Congres where I conducted my business diagonally across the street from the hotel  Chinatown is just one block north  The Basilica de Notre Dame and Old Montreal are a  minute walk south albeit partially through an incline  The nightlife on Rue St  Catherine as well as the business district are a  minute taxi cab away  By the way I appreciated how there almost always seemed to be taxi cabs available at the hotel entrance I ided to treat myself to a Swedish massage at Spa Sinomonde which is located in the hotels basement  I enjoyed a wonderful one hour massage from a lovely lady named Oksana The  charge before taxes is a great deal even in the States Customers also have access to the rest of the facilities during their visit  While I liked the billiards setup and appreciated the upgraded fitness facilities I opted to relax in one of the two whirlpools next to the sauna  I had my only hotel meal on my final morning at the Chez Chine restaurant  The  quotComplete Breakfastquot was a ent value for a hotel buffet  As you can guess by now the hotel was influenced by its location at the edge of Chinatown  I read some literature that it was built on feng shui principles a fact that  encourage some people  While the immediate area is quiet at night I never felt unsafe  A few tips if youre looking to exchange money check out Lys Jewelry Store one block north on Rue St  Urbain to the pedestrian walkway in Chinatown  The rates and  charge are better than the banks and and airport money exchangers for sure  For reasonable snacks or prepared meals head a few blocks further north to the IGA superket  So basically if youre looking for a solid three star hotel convenient to the Palais des Congres Chinatown and Old Montreal you could do worse than the Holiday Inn Select Centre Ville  I  be returning for pleasure in a couple months and if the rate is reasonable under  I just  stay here again One last thing get used to the fact that no matter what button you push the elevator will always stop on the nd floor reception level    always  Cheers 
P => Great room good location We booked  rooms for  travelers for t       Check in was quick and easy  The staff was helpful and the rooms were huge  Each room had  queen beds with room for  peoples luggage  The rooms were clean and quiet  The hotel is just  blocks from Old Montreal with the Notre Dame Cathedral  This is a nice part of town full of small shops and restaurants  The architecture of this area is beautiful On the other side of the hotel is Montreals Chinatown  When youve fully explored these areas a subwaymetro stop is right across the street from the hotel so you can get around town pretty easily  The metro only runs till am so if youre heading out to check out Montreals night life you  have to take a cab back to the hotel though cabs are not too expensive in Montreal  We would happily stay at this hotel again  It was clean quiet and convenient for getting around  We spent much of our time in the old part of town so it was great for that  The only problem we had was rather minor  There are not a lot of restaurants open late in this part of town on weeknights  Our flight into Montreal was delayed by several hours and we did not get settled into our rooms until around pm  We went down to the front desk to ask for recommendations for dinner that night and were told there is not much in the area open late this was a Tuesday night   it was better later on our trip during the weekend  We ended up around the corner at a small chinese restaurant  The desk staff said that would be all we would find at this time of night  Other than that oddity at least odd to us we had a great time in Montreal and the Holiday Inn Select  We would definitely stay here again 
P => Good or in the Lobby  The lobby of this hotel is very nicely orated in Chinese motifs complete with a reflecting pool and an Asian garden  The guest level corridor carpets could use some updating but the rooms themselves are large and comforable  The candid photos seem to show only a small portion of the room  As for the the location its very hard to beat  Its located in Chinatown which I took as a positive  Theres always a restaurant or two open any time of the day  Granted the quality of the food varies but thats part of the fun and its not really the hotels responsibility  Besides the hotel is literally two blocks from Vieux Montreal so if youre into fancy French cuisine you have your pick as well  
P => Great location friendly staff great room  Stayed here  y     y Easy to find coming from the highway and located near the old city this is a perfect place to stay  Its situated in Chinatown the reception is on the nd floor and is surrounded by a bar restaurant and chinese inside garden  There is also a parking for only CAhrs On arriving we immediately got a larger room without asking on the th floor  This was a nice upgrade larger beds a desk very large room and extra seats and table  The only thing was it was quite a long walk to the elevator  There was free WiFi available throughout the hotel This hotel comes at a fairly cheap price offers a lot friendly staff and a great location near the old city and subway  What else would you want  I would certainly stay here again  
P => avoid this hotel if you can The only good for this hotel is the location  The service is bad  Staff is not friendly  The carpet is old  Overcharge on my credit card and get no response from hotel about this issue the hotel staffs never return the call although they claim they will  Have to escalate to Head office to resolve this issue and get my overcharge money back  Avoid this hotel if you can 
P => Age showing At one time I would have given the hotel a  rating but as time moves on it has moved down to a   rating  We visit Montreal at least annually yrs now and make it a point to stay here because of its convenient location and staff  Counter to another review we find the hotel to be very child friendly with its uncrowded pool and serene fish pond which fascinates the young ones  Our first few visits ensured our return stays as the hotel was new and the staff extremely friendly and helpful same staff over these years  but over the years the rooms have started to show their age and the service has lined slighty as people have moved on and given these changes we  move onto another hotel as well    
P => Comfort Good Service Great Location We are a family of four with two young children and had a very good experience here during a winter weekend in Montreal  The pool is small but perfect for young children  The lobby is delightful as you can walk on bridges over a shallow pond that is the home of a group of koi fish  The location of the hotel is excellent    right next to Chinatown and walking distance from Old Montreal  The subway is right across the street  The staff responded quickly to special requests for extra pillows and a sewing kit  Parking is a bit expensive at  per night but you have inout privileges  We got a good price thru Priceline and found the Holiday Inn to be a comfortable place to stay while exploring the city  Special recommendation Try quotEggspectationquot for a great breakfast  Go to the one on St  Jacque only a few blocks from the hotel  
P => Nice Hotel Nice Hotel right in China Town area  Quiet and great reception area with fish pool and waterfall  Parking was  dollars per day though  There was a cheaper garage one block up  per day  Lots of Chinese Restarants within short distance  Aviod the large buffet though forgot name not quite the quality that most American Chinese Buffets are  I got a great price on hotwire so overall I was very happy with my stay    
P => Good location My family of four stayed in this hotel on ober   for one night  We got a good rate through the Entertainment book The Holiday Inn Select is in Chinatown and is close to some tourist attractions  The room itself was nice with a view of the Old Town part of Montreal  Im not sure about the other room views  There was some graffiti noticed on nearby buildings on the other side of the hotel  There was a pool hot tub and sauna that we used both at night and in the morning  The water was a little cool and the pool seemed small considering how many people stay in the hotel  No one else used the pool while we were there so be it is big enough  The exercise room is in the same area on the third floor and it seemed pretty good We did not take advantage of the spa nor did I eat at the restaurant so I cannot comment on those things  Holiday Inns dont usually have a continental breakfast  We did get an overpriced pizza from room service  The ad said something like quotpizza from quot but we paid a total of  for a medium pepperoni  The parking fee is  and though the guy at the front desk said that it was validated the amount was charged to our bill  It wasnt a surprise thanks to comments I read here before I arrived  There are signs everywhere telling patrons to take your parking ticket to the front desk before attempting to depart the parking garage  Anyway Ill reiterate that you need to add that in when calculating the cost of your stay  Also note that a concierge controls the carts that bring your luggage to your room The lobby area is very nice with the fish swimming in the ponds and the whole Chinese bit One of the people that worked behind the desk rides his bike to work and lent us his air pump to blow up some inner tube ring bathing suit attachments so our pre schoolers could swim unaided  That was pretty helpful Id consider staying there again in the future but would check alternatives

P => Nice and Simple I came to Montreal to visit with a few friends  Found this hotel near the Gray hound terminal  Its a nice hotel  The people were nice and gave us a lot of good advice on what to visit in the city  The room wasnt bad at all for the price your paying  It was a ble fire place not working high ceiling  The hotel was and old European style home reated into a hotel  I liked the charm  Would go back  
P => nice hotel  good service The Hotel is at a very convenient location in Downtown Montreal  Our room was clean  The bed comfortable with nice clean sheets  There was a little problem with the air conditioner it was taken care of  Very friendly staff and good service  
P => Terrible experience   beware of bed bugs This hotel seemed innocent enough   an old gentleman behind the desk who was friendly ladies in the morning so we were willing to forget some of the things until the morning we were leaving we stayed there for  nights when I developed red spots all over my body  They started itching and hurting and eventually had puss all over them  We returned home to the US from Montreal and my husband matched the shape and pattern   bites at a time in numerous places to bed bugs It was awful   much worse than mosquito bites   they swell up fill in with puss and stay on for weeks after  The worst thing would have been if we brought these home   I washed EVERYTHING and prayed that no bugs came with us home   and seems like not  I am sure the owners knew about bed bugs   they should be forbidden from running a business Other problems with this hotel that I should bring up  Our room smelled like an ashtray   the smell of cigarettes was so strong that I felt like a had a pack myself  We opened our one window and that helped but the window itself     almost fell out on the street so we were worried someone is going to get hit below us if the wind blows over   My husband found a syringe right on top of one of the dressers   I do not want to think what went on in this room before   BED BUGS   terrible never had such an experience before and I stayed at hostels etcStay away unless you want to suffer and possibly bring disease home  
P => Good for  night stay I stayed at the Hotel  Sasions for one night only so this is only based on my  hrs stay The hotel or rather I should say motel is a little small victoria house  There are other hotels around the same block so I really had to paid attention to the signs The entrance is on the first floor  It was only a Thursday night but was fully booked  A sign that says No Vancancy was taped onto the door  The door was locked when I tried to open it  Then a man emerged from the inside and opened it for me  I told him a reservation has already been made early the week  So he let me in  The man turns out to be my check in guy  He told me theres internet access here on the st floor which essentially was right beside the check in counter and therell be continental breakfast at am  The breakfast was literally on the right side of the check in area  Very small but cute  He handed me the key and I went up to my room There wasnt much review about this hotel so I searched elsewhere on the website  Most of the other reviews rated this place    Everyone seems to disliked the smoke smell in their rooms  but they liked the or though The room was slightly smaller than what I had expected  But it got a bed and a washroom so it meets my requirement  My room did smell like reeze  cigarette smell  just like what the other posters had said  It has a TV and a mini fridge as well  My TV remote control was running out of battery so often times I couldnt switch channels no bigging     There were lots of pot lights and a cute chandiller hanging above my bed as well As I was about to turn the lights off there was one set of pot lights I couldnt switch off  It turns out the light switch was missing the acutally switch  One thing to note is that these switches are the dimmer sitch so I used my key and was able to glide the actually control to the off position   The bed was old but had no cig  butts  Becuase there are other hotels in the area so I could hear people talking loudly on the patio  Luckily I was really tired so I slept through it Checked out was a breeze the next mornng  Mimi was very nice  I grabbed my breakfast and left the hotel  
P => Tr s bon souvenir  
P => 
P => Good price and location I chose this place as an alternative to the Sheraton two blocks away which was being used as a meeting location  At less than a third of the Sheratons price the only real difference I noticed was that the rooms were a lot smaller  Everything was new and clean the only slight complaint was that the AC unit was rather loud when running but at least it cycled on and off smoothly rather than switching on with a distinct ka chunk like some do so it wasnt too hard to sleep through  This place is really good value for money some of the folks staying at the Sheraton couldnt believe that I was paying less for my entire stay than they paid for one night  
P => Just what we were looking for My husband and I went on a last minute getaway to the beer festival in Montreal and stayed here  All the other hotels in walking distance were over  a night and this one was   It was advertized as having soft beds and great water pressure for showers  For the time we spent in the hotel it was all we wanted We only needed a clean safe place to sleep and shower and we got it The room was small but we didnt need a lot of space  Great value and great location if you are planning to visit the city  
P => Nice Hotel Let me tell you a little bit about this hotel  Hotel AK is a wonderful choice for anyone who is traveling alone or as a couple I do not recommend for families as the room I was staying in was a bit small I was traveling in early y of  with my husband to see the jazz festival  We enjoyed everything about this hotel  The staff was kind the rooms were well orated and the price was cheap  Only  dollars for the jazz festival dates All of the other hotels that I inquired to quoted me at least  dollars for a double room  If you want a nice hotel to stay at and are traveling alone or as a couple I would definitely recommend you to pay this place a visit if you come to Montr al  
P => Great hotel super rates and location We stayed here for a couple of nights in   First the good       We enjoyed the location which is very close to the main shopping areas  It is also very handy for the Metro  The rooms were very clean and well orated  The bed was one of the softest I have ever slept on   very nice  The staff were also very friendly Now for the bad       Although the room was well orated it was a little bit small for a family of four but the generous administration added a cot to our room so that we would be more comfortable  I would recommend this place to people without young children as they need to run around if you want a sweet deal friendly service and a nice place to stay at night this is the best Hotel for youBottom line   The rates were very economical the staff was friendly and the rooms were clean so I would say that I would stay here again as the good points outweighed the bad ones Oh and I forgot to tell you they have an amazing all you can eat Indian restaurant and if you ask they can give you a discount  MUST try if you stay at this hotel 
P => 
P => enjoyed our  day stay at the auberge universel we stayed at the auberge universel for  days as our son was taking part in the swimming olympic trials at the nearby olympic stadium  We had a room on the th floor which was spacious and clean  There are no complaints about this hotel  There were no problems with the elevator and lots of stairs so getting up and down was not an issue  Because of the swimming trials the hotel was fully booked and yet our rooms were always cleaned by the time we returned from morning prelims around am  Food is quite pricey but was good  There are quite a few cheaper places to eat within a five minute walk of the hotel  The shuttle was great although we walked most of the time as its so near to the stadium  We paid half the amount of other clubs in the downtown hotels per night  Reception staff were very helpful and friendly  We had athletes on various floors and nobody had any complaints about this hotel  I hear the reated rooms are very nice but we were perfectly ok with the standard rooms  
P => WARNING NEVER waste your money there I had never visited Montreal before and because of my horrible experience at the Auberge Universal Hotel I will NEVER visit CANADA AGAIN From the outside it looks like a whore housemotel     Rooms POOR QUAILITY  THE WEBSITE IS MISLEADING  My room resembled the projects in New York City  Very dark and creepy peopled looked into our room through the windows even with the curtains  Smelt like smoke even though non smoking  My asthma was at its worst here  Thin walls allowed me to hear the quotmoansquot of my neighbor and the screams in the hall way Location IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE Nothing interesting in the area not even the dome so much so the government is considering closing it  Few restaurants are NASTY DISGUSTING and EXPENSIVEAmenities POOL disgusting water paint chipping off the bottom and rubs off on skin  EXTREMELY shallow best to swim in a bathtub   JACUZZI water never hot needs cleaning only  persons can be quotjetted at a time  SAUNA cramped room for a very intimate  not hot at all  GYM no problems pretty basic StaffReceptionists Very nice but MAKE SURE YOU DOCUMENT AND READ EVERY TRANSACTION MADE THERE English is ok but be very specific I asked for the TOTAL of my stay at the hotel and was told quotthe total stay for both nights would be  quot At the end of my  night stay I was charged close to   They meant the total PER night was  but did not even apologize for the misunderstanding Administration  Not reliable  Very hard to reach and EXTREMLEY aggressive and RUDE over the telephone  As an excuse for their incompetence they LOVE to stress that their staff speaks quotBOTH English and Frenchquot very well  Dont let them use this excuse with you  
P => a disgusting dump from the s I normally only stay at franchise hotels but I was booked in here as part of a group  The lobby and restaurant are very nice but that is where it stops We were put in a room on the th floor and the minute I walked in it was like a slap in the face  The room is totally unreated with stucco on the walls a worn out FILTHY carpet black mould on the bathtub grouting A LOT OF IT old worn out bedspreads that were pilled all over and in general very disgusting  Old is one thing but if it were clean it  not have been too bad  In this case the dirt collected behind the furniture and around the carpet baseboards had been there a long time  i pulled out the night stand OH MY GOD then I pulled up the chair cushion and trust me you would not want to know the filth there  I have seen cleaner motels  The next step is to either check out and find another hotel or see if there is a better room  After voicing my disgust with the front desk I was moved to a room on the th floor and I must admit that this room is up to most of the industry standards  So if you are planning to stay here its BUYER BEWARE The duty manager did mention that the th floor has been reated so ask for that floor  The rest of the place is a DUMP 
P => No problem but avoid the smoking rooms This is a large hotel with conference rooms but located a bit away from downtown Montreal  The lobby is good the hotel restaurant is VERY good  The location is ok its near the Botanical Gardens and the Biodome and Insectarium but its a long walk  The hotel offers a shuttle to these places and also one to the subway The rooms are ok   nothing special  We had to take a smoking room and it smelled as expected We left another hotel for this one and this was smaller smellier because of the smoking room and less conveniently located but the lobby and the slightly more modern furniture suited my family better   though I preferred the original hotel  So we compromised   which means they had their way totally    
P => was good to be back Used this hotel in late s when travelling for buisness and catching the odd Montreal Expos baseball game  short walk to Olympic park  I Drove in from Quebec City for a hockey tournament with my  year old and my wife   Coulnt believe the change as I had not been in Montreal lateley because of less travelling for work  The Service was very good as in the past and the rates stayed rather competitive for the location  Also pleased to notice many familliar faces still at their post from my previous stays  Many improvenents such as new furniture in rooms  beautiful lobby pool parking for free is also another   and good restaurant too  Good work   
P => Best kept Secret In Montreal Booked directly through the hotel after being impressed with the website  Jennifer who took our resevation was sweet  The room we booked was as extraordinary as discribed by the pictures on the web and moreso in person New upholstered rooms with soft underpadding high end simmons pillowtop mattresses we peeked duvet cover white on white with pin stripes with matching pillows to boot  New TV new lamps free WIFI which was great his amp her kimonos on the bed when we arrived   simply fantastic for a  star property no name brand at a fraction of the price of the major brands The Front Desk Staff should be commended as well as the restaurant staff with their buffet breakfast starting at AM which my husband thought was great   and I loved the price at less than  We truly recommend while in Montreal Doris 
P => Old tired weak I stayed here one night on a business trip and booked this only due to my clients recommendation as the closest hotel to the early morning meeting I had And thats the only really positive thing I have to say it was close to my meeting  The building exterior is a s soviet block style concrete bunker Once youre inside the lobby area is relatively nice The hallways are drab with low ceilings and institutional feel as are rooms  All the basic amenities were there TV minifridge etc  but the or and ambience were depressing the bathroom and vanity area was very small the ironing board was the flimsiest thing I have seen in the hundreds of hotel stays Ive had in the last ade and so forth Service was OK but indifferent  No automatic checkout that business travelers expect had to stop at front desk to check out I did not eat here so cant comment on the restaurant Everything in the room was basically clean and serviceable but I feel the  star  AAA  diamond rating is off by at least one point The other other hotels Ive stayed in Montreal have been fantastic in comparision Le Saint Sulpice Auberge Bonaparte  
P => Rude Staff I booked two rooms for eight people at this hotel to visit the nearby LaRonde amusement park  After visiting the downtown area for a few hours we returned to our rooms around am to grab a bite from the restaurant which is open until am  Within a minute from arriving a woman down the hall left her room to complain to security about the quotnoisequot coming from my room though we had just arrived  A minute later security banged on my door to tell me that if we did not quiet down they would quotevictquot us  Than they proceeded to the other room registered in my name and threatened to evict my friends who were sleeping in their beds and were making no noise  The next day security called to see how many people were in one of the rooms  At the time two people from another room were visiting so there were six people  Security asked how many people were in the room and assuming he meant how many people slept there my friend said  people  Security told them they were WATCHING THEM THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW and knew there were  people  Later as a friend left one room to visit another a security guard again threatened to evict us for having more than  people in the room  My friend asked if it was okay to visit the other room and the security guard just glared at her and stormed off  In addition to having a complete INVASION of privacy the staff was rude and hostile especially because we are American  Ill gladly take my  elsewhere next time  I have never been more infuriarated with a hotel in my life 
P => The lobby is nice thats the only part We stayed here for  nights  It was a softball tournament  The lobby looks nice for the money spent still a little expensive for what they have  The rooms are small amp need to be updated years ago  The beds are uncomfortable hard as the floor  The ac didnt work well either  In the morning everything had a wet feel to it which when we left the hotel your clothes would have a odor to them  Our bathroom sinks water did not turn off completely so you had to be careful using the blow dryer the outlet was right next to the sink  We had a few issues with our room the fridge amp tv didnt work  we notified the front desk  times over a  hr span nobody came to fix them  So they just switched our room  The indoor pool is small compared to the pictures they have advertised  The so called hot tub is not that hot only reached about  degrees one time durring our stay  Another inconvience is that they only have  main elevator for the  floors  So you always had to wait for the elevator  The hotel gift shop will convert money for you but I suggest that you go down the street to the bank  The gift shop would give you   can for   us the front desk would give you   can for   us   On the way home   the border they will change   can for   us   be careful check the exhange rate  I would not stay here again unless it was free  
P => NOT a Four Star Hotel The web site for this hotel is very misleading as it only gives pictures of the new reated suites but only the suites the lobby and the restaurant have been touched since the hotels opening  The halls and regular rooms are dark and the halls clearly havent been painted  Even with all the lights on during the day the room is still dark  We requested to be moved in to a suite and it was better but smelled horrible  We returened home to find our clothes smelling like the hotel  While the executive suite seemed nice and luxurious many things are broken and the stained glass doors barely open  The bathtub no longer had many of the installed features but at least the suite wasnt as dark as regular rooms  However it is one of the few hotels in the east end and the others are for the most part motels  The Auberge Universel isnt the advertised four star hotel but it serves a purpose  
P => Good hotel in useful east side location I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Auberge Universel  Everything was in good working order and my room had a fine view of the Olympic Tower also the Pom Bakery next door    The hotel bills itself as being across the street from Olympic Stadium which technically is true it is across the street from Parc Olympique and one only needs to cross the street once to get there  However the stadium is a ways south in this large park from the hotel and if youre seeing the Expos and need to go in the one place where tickets are sold its really the equivalent of at least a five block walk  Still the location is very useful this probably is the closest place you can stay to the stadium and likewise it is very handy to all the attractions in that area like Biodome the botanical gardens and insectarium  Its also across the street from the large Olympic Village apartments  Its not terribly far from the metro either if you want to go downtown  Free parking they give you a ticket to come and go at the front desk and a reasonable rate give it a leg up on the pricier downtown hotels where parking can be very costly  There are several large restaurants within a few blocks going up Sherbrooke away from the park  Externally its grey cementy looking construction  which fits in kind of well with the Olympic era things built a ade or so before the hotel  Not a beautiful hotel from the outside by any means but the area is clean and safe  Id gladly stay there again  I just wish the Expos would still be there next year

P => dont go there    Bed bugs found    dirty bed sheets    flat pillows i mean as flat as a sweater    bugs crawling around in the washroom    AC was off    dirty sofa    dirt on carpet seems like it has not been vaccumed    left over garbage from the previous customers    dirty comforter    even though it is the cheapest within  around the downtown area my boyfriend and I will never go back there    words extremely bad 
P => Average hotel good location I agree with previous reviews that this hotel is not great value for what you get  The pillows were as thn as a folder sweatshirt the television did not come with a remote and the orange juice that came with my breakfast could have been served in shot glass  Still overall my room was clean the location is excellent and there is more ambiance than in staying at a large chain  I stayed for one Saturday night in y only so the price was not great but Im sure in the off season or for extended stays a discount could be negotiated Recommended  
P => HORRIBLE AND OVERPRICED HOTEL This is the most horrible hotel in the world  It will be good for  per night but  per night is just TOO MUCH We stayed there for New years  The room was ugly  A chair was brokeThe sink had a HORRIBLE SMELLThe Bathtub was soo dirty IT HAD LOTS OF HAIRS YUCKBehind the toilet was soo sooo so dirty  It seemed like nobody cleaned it since long long time ago  The breakfast was ONE CROISSANT half a cup of yucky coffee and half a cup of orange juice  THAT WAS IT  The TV was interesting  I think my parents had that TV when I was born  The transmission stopped all the time and we had to wait a little bit until the transmission was normal again The carpet had big stains on the floor  I had to put on my shoes after waking up  I just couldn t put my feet in that carpet  And after all this they charged  DOLLARS That hotel is worth  MAXAfter our ugly stay I wrote an email to the hotel about my complaints and he never answered  I am sure he knows that his hotel has a rank of  It is just not fair that people take advantage of others  I mean they put beautiful photos on the website but they are way far from the reality If anybody need more information write here and I will answer your questions  
P => Good Location but kinda of pricey for what if offers at least when I went We learned of Casa Bella Inc  from a travel guidebook  We call them directly and the guy on the phone sounded really nice so we went for it  My boyfriend and I stayed there the week before Labor day when we were traveling trough Canada and realized that it is probably the single busiest week for Montreal with all the movie jazz and rock festivals they have that week  It cost us  Canadian including taxes and parking for  nights for one queen bedroom and  night in a two queen bedroom they had to change us rooms because they already sold out the  queen room for the weekend to another couple We had to take it because there were no more places available Pluses Even though the front desk girl didnt speak lots of English she was very pleasant and attentive  The hotel is located near Boulevard St  Laurent and Rue Saint Dennis both streets that have the best night and restaurant scene  The location allows you to walk to most places of interest  The rooms were surprisingly very spacious Minuses It says that the room has AC but ours never worked so I had to open the window and couldn t sleep at all the first night because of the busy and noisy street  The room is cozy and clean but it looks very much like a two star hostel  The breakfast is not good cheap concentrated orange juice store bough cheap croissants  I read that someone liked the breakfast judge for yourself order it one day and see if you like it I still recommend you to add in your budget breakfast outside just in case  
P => cute French hotel with sweet room  You cannot go wrong with staying at this cute and elegant French flavored hotel in French speaking Montreal the world nd largest French speaking city  My room was large with a terrific shower  The room was kept cool without the annoying AC noises central AC  The family that runs the hotel attends to your every need  The hotel is stly located within walking distance to downtown China town and the shopping district  Its also a block away from the metro subway I miss it and will stay there again and I will try to ask for the wing that has a lot more traditional European or if I am lucky to get it  
P => Clean but troublesome You get what you pay for  Great location just a short walk from the Metro and an Underground City food court as well as lots of quotregularquot restaurants and downtown attractions  Unfortunately I arrived after hours on a Friday and stayed the weekend  The off hours desk person did not speak English other than  or  words  I can ask quotWhere is a nearby restaurantquot among other things thank you in clear French and she just didnt get it trying to direct me to the grocery store across the street  It was impossible to communicate with her even by pointing at posted bilingual notices  InfoTouriste assured me that ALL tourist related locations in Montreal have fluent bilingual speakers available  InfoTouriste is wrong  Rooms didnt have alarm clocks no wakeup call available individual room temperature controls non existent not even a box of Kleenex No tub either  Id been looking forward to relaxing from the rest of my trip in a bubble bath  But the rooms were clean mattress was thin but comfortable enough after a hard day of walking and breakfast could be ordered in the mornings  Their website says quotfresh warm croissants baked on the premisesquot but the croissants were obviously those soggy store bought things warmed up somewhere  They were edible though as was the toast tiny glass of orange juice and tea  Towels were small thin and miserly in number stairs were abundant and steep and I feel sorry for people who brought their cars with them as all the cars had to be shifted around by valet every time someone needed theirs  PS An English speaker appeared at the desk early Monday morning    too late for my needs  
P => Great This is a nice little place and the staff are very helpful and friendly  It is also in a great location  The metro is close by and the walk to McGill is only about ten minutes  We stayed here for a few days to visit the university and visit the city  This place would also be a great spot if you are visiting for the jazz festival  Place des Arts is just a few blocks away  Parking in the back was a plus  We left the car and forgot about it for during our stay then walked or took the metro  Have fun 
P => Very Nice Hotel After reading all the rating reviews I ided to stay at Hotel Casa Bella for my first night in Montreal  Its a great place the room is very clean and the staff are very kind this is a great hotel for two stars  I love this hotel and ill surely come back for my next trip on Montreal 
P => Casa Bella is A OK I read several reviews of this hotel before traveling to Montreal including a very angry negative one  Nevertheless I booked into Casa Bella and am glad that I did  It has a terrific central location  The hotel was inexpensive and very clean  The room was pleasant and the beds comfortable  The staff was friendly  There are spaces to park behind the hotel    if cars need to be moved at present only the hotel owners family has access to the keys  Parking is at a premium in downtown Montreal so the free parking was a plus I recommend this hotel for all travelers who understand what a European style quottourist classquot hotel is  Dont expect an elevator or help with your luggage for instance  For a two star tourist hotel Casa Bella is good value for money  
P => Hotel Casa Bella in Montreal  My wife Carmelina and I  Charles Bray  with my son and his wife we all had great time in Montreal specially at the  Casa Bella  and it does carry its name because the hotel was really clean and beautiful with a great service such as breakfast in the morning  The address of the Hotel is  Sherbrooke Street West the location of the hotel I found it close to everything that you like to visit in any attraction places  I took lots of pictures in which I walked from the Hotel Casa Bella in which you could see on my website  httpwww greatestcities comuserscbray 
P => everything is cool This is kind of an answer to the London traveller   I find your review a little bit harsh I stay quite often in that Hotel and eveything is said at the reception  There is a panel with the inscription quotANYTIME you can reach the reception either by phone or by the bellquot  At the check in the concierge explain that the reception close at  am and open at  am that is sufficient for anybody except for you    You talked about the Hotel you were in the second night I know that hotel because I used to stay there before but you skipped to mentionned that if the parking is  you have to pay that amount EACH TIME you take your car At the Casa Bella the parking is free and we have access ANYTIME Concerning the phone charges of       per call in fact it would have cost you   to use a public phone anywhere in the city including the one in the hall Continental breakfast means Croissant and coffee its in the Hotel rules inside the room  Nobody ever mentionned eggs bacon saussage or anything else  Anyway as you noticed it there is a superket and restaurants just accross the street if youre still hungry  You also forgot to mentionned that the breakfast is a COMPLIMENTARY so you dont pay for it  As for the quotsmallquot cup of coffee its the regular size as in any restaurant  oz  They arent gonna put a coffee pot on you tray   Obviously you dont have so much thing to do in yours vacations because it take some time taking notes about every lines of the Hotel rules and you only stay one night  be it was your first travel outside London   Your review was nothing except mean and unjust Like I said when I stay at the Casa Bella everything is perfect the coffee is good and there is no problem if you want refill  croissant is fresh every morning there is also toasts muffin orange juice  oz and jam  For something free thats sufficient The staff is helpfull and nice  When I do and not just myself other guests are treated the same way an early check out around  am there is somebody at the reception my car is ready to go    everything is fine except for somebody looking to get Buckingham Palace for  with a big breakfast  
P => Free parking though flawed is a plus worth C  I stayed one night at Casa Bella on  y  based on the good reviews posted here  The Casa Bella occupies two laterally converted townhouses on Sherbrooke west about half way between McGill University and the Latin Quarter each of which is about  minutes walk  Location wise it is central in that geographic sense but practically speaking it is neither here nor there as the couple of blocks surrounding the hotel are quite barren straddling the line between downtown offices and the edge of the Mont Royal residential area  Having said that it is quite safe and quiet to walk around at night  There is a gas station across the street and behind it a Provigo superket  Construction is currently going on the site surrounding the hotel but since I was there on a weekend I cannot tell you whether it would be noisy or not when they work  The previous reviewers were accurate to describe Casa Bella as a European style hotel   narrow bit rundown in my view some will say its quotcharmingquot but Im sure one can pick out much more than just charm from the  year old carpeting and no frills  I stayed in one of the cheapest rooms No  a single with a shared bath on the ground floor facing the back for Ctax  Ive seen that the doubles from Ctax in the hotel are much larger but my single was so narrow that it would be impossible to fit to two single beds side by side  There was a stool under my side table but there wasnt enough space between the table and the bed to pull it out  The room had a wash basin which was useful since the bath was shared  The TV in the room was small and had a arate cable box but it sufficed and worked fine  My window looked straight out at the construction site and I guess when the project is done half of the hotels rooms in the back will be looking at other peoples homes instead of the previous alleyway view  Now the hotel gives you two keys one for your room and one for the front door  Why Because even though the owner and some of the staff live on site the reception is closed between pm and am which means two things  you will not receive any telephone calls in your room during those hours and  nobody will move the other cars in the parking lot for you if you need to take your car out  I dont want to sound too petty after all I did book the smallest room but I think the C charge for every telephone call including local and toll free is a bit steep and the breakfast is a bit mean  As the hotel does not have a breakfast room I got mine delivered on a tray to the room never mind the TV was on the side table so I had to eat on top of the drawer chest  The breakfast ration was a small cup of orange juice a small cup of coffee a croissant and   I wonder why   a quarter of a muffin  I guess they believe people cannot stomach an entire or even half a muffin  Anyway I checked out the following morning and moved to a hotel right on festive St Denis in the Latin Quarter and got a larger single with ensuite bathroom for Ctax and another C for parking  I have to say Im surprised why all the reviews here are so unreservedly positive  
P => A Vacation in Montreal For Americans used to corporate chain motels the Hotel Casa Bella was a delightful place to stay while visiting Montreal  Our room was clean and attractively furnished the staff were pleasant and helpful and the breakfast croissants and coffee were a wonderful way to start a day in Montreal Located in the heart of downtown Montreal close to the Metro restaurants coffee shops shopping McGill University and a delightful grocery store on Avenue du Parc I recommend this European style hotel to anyone wanting to visit Montreal  
P => Great spot Impeccably clean charming cheap great downtown location and wonderful owner who lives in the building and staff  I didnt plan to be in my room a whole lot in the  days I was there so I got the smallest room which is indeed small but I stayed in downtown Montreal for  per night tax in and including continental breakfast The parking is a bit strange two or three spots behind the building one in front of the other but certainly bearable  You leave your keys with the front desk in case they have to move it Its ok though with all the other pluses  Il stay here again no question  
P => Great location one of the bests in Montreal This little hotel is very charming  Located downtown its steps away from everything in Montreal subway bus and train stations shopping area clubs museums theaters    The staff was very accomodating and the lady running the place was very nice  The complimentary breakfast coffee and croissant is great and the coffee is so good  
P => plut t passable  
P => 
P => never going there again never again  Dirt    Smaell    No parking     Unfriendy        Forsing people pay tips 
P => Fabulous location lovely staff We had a two day stay with three other people in mid y and found this hotel to be a very good value for the money  The location could not have been better the staff delightful and helpful and the showers superb The rooms are small but fine with all the necessary amenities  The breakfast was tasty and the staff encouraged us to relax and drink as much coffee as we wanted  I would recommend this in a heartbeatJacquie 
P => Staff   extremely polite and helpful location   ideal rooms   grim but adequate  I stayed here with a friend having read the reviews we couldnt believe Lonely Planet had described it as having a quotlovely timeless stylequot when we saw the room   furniture out of a k shop more like  So I knew that  I  have to drag my large suitcase up  floors I did but that was OK  the rooms would be small and noisy they were but I wasnt there to linger in my hotel room and kept my bag packed ready for a quick getaway wishful thinking and had earplugs my friend didnt though and she didnt get much sleep and  the breakfast would be great but since I dont eat a cooked breakfast and breakfast wasnt included in our deal I considered  a bit steep for a croissant and coffee and took my custom elsewhere  What I wasnt prepared for was  the dried chewing gum on the carpet by my bed when I arrived yuk Was that to make up for no breakfast included  the two enormous ants frolicking over my sheets in the morning fortunately after this grim first nights experience in the dark and dingey room  the manager moved us to the lighter brighter and chewing gum free room  with a view as he said they needed to do reation work in the bathroom and the ants didnt follow us or  the propensity of the toilet to get blocked this wasnt a problem though the manager kindly offered us the use of another room but as it happened on our last night we didnt take him up on the offer  However the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful despite our rudimentary schoolgirl French at least we tried the location was fantastic for the metro and walking around the old town and it was VERY cheap we rang them and were offered a  nights for the price of  deal  So given the price and the extreme courtesy of the staff I put up with the tattyness of the place but I wouldnt return and would only recommend it to those staying for one night who arent overly fussy about cleanliness carpet needed vacuuming but sheets and bathroom appeared clean enough and arent planning on spending any time in their room  
P => Dont go This is a Hostel with private bathrooms Went  th room just fits the double bed plus a foot on each side  Check in before pm or else you must make a phone call and then wait around  No elevator  Dark and creepy throughout  Found an Exstacy tablet on the floor of our room  Bathroom is sub par and needed a good cleaning  Check is at am and they ring the room to remind you The breakfast was pretty good  The service personnel were courteous Nice place if you are or have been homeless  
P => Great location great value great staff I travelled to Montreal for businessmini holiday and booked this hotel prior to reading the reviews  The only mistake I made was to read the bad reviews Staying here was fantastic for the amount of money you pay The location is superb and the staff were very friendly   for those travellers who said the staff were rudeunhelpful perhaps it is your attitude that stinks For one reviewer who said that they take a copy of your ID or passport   well of course they do What if you trash the room or dont pay your debt etc  How do they find you You obviously dont travel much because if you did youd know this happens everywhere and is not a scam to steal your identity There are definitely NO bedbugs here It was extremely clean and the toilet and shower were cleaned daily  The cleaning lady even arranged all my cosmetic bottles in height order every day to make things neat  Yes the rooms are tiny and the woodwork chipped but what do you expect If you want  star quality youll have to pay for it So all in all a great hotel plenty of character VERY clean with friendly and helpful staff great breakfasts and a sensational price  You will not regret your stay here Champ de s a great hotel Montreal a great city Loved it 
P => the hot and the cold I will make this short as i hate to write very much Ok the service was great the owner was professional and so was the people working for him The free breakfast was good I am a Chef as well  Though a note on the free breakfast This is not a buffet it is operated like a small restaurant  If you book a night you get one free meal for this night though you must pay the tip for the lovely spanish cook lady  as a note perfect service in french english or spanish in this hotel great stuffThe hotel was very clean and smelled great with a nice xmas oration The only thing that bothered me was that the rooms were cold so was the hallways  This is an old Hotel and i guess more cold can enter than it can give away heat Though the situation inproved a bit better as the outside temperature did shift to higer degrees  So if you travel from a tropical location do not rent a room here in winter plz  Ok this hotel did not spoil the great time i had in montreal but i would sadly not go back  
P => Beautiful romantic getaway I found myself with a vacation week and no plans but then I noticed this little hotel online and was so thrilled with the price I thought it was worth it to spoil my hubby and I  WE ARE SO GLAD WE DID ITYes the rooms are small but the high ceilings large windows facing the city very well insulated almost sound proof walls and the cleanest hotel room I have seen in quite a while make up for the lack of wasted floor space You get a free breakfast in the wonderful restaurant each morning and a key to the hotel front door if you are staying out late   as she said quotthis is not your mommas housequot when we asked about the curfewBeautiful old building in the old section of Montreal so well located that we walked everywhere except when we visited the underground city for some shopping  I will never book with a major hotel chain in this city because the wonderful hotel made me feel part of Old Montreal To another review   quotYes Dallas the city is French so that shouldnt have surprised you quot 
P => The value of reviews       or not I read the reviews of others carefully before finally choosing this place for a  day trip to Montreal purely pleasure  It looked ok from the photos and seemed a good location but some of the reviews were disturbing  Had I not read them I would have just booked it  In the end I went with my intuition and did  It was wonderful  Helpful pleasant caring staff great food clean quiet and quaint  Walking distance from Vieux Montreal the Places des Arts the Latin Quarter Chinatown the Village the Metroall the sites along the river and many restaurants  Ok the room was small but who goes to Montreal on holiday for the room 
P => Good location thats all My husband and I spent two nights at this place  Since we read all the reviews we knew what to expect  The room are extremely small and had the smallest TV I had ever seen  They are however nice and clean for the price you pay This place is good if you are hoping to spend most of your time outside  The bed and the floors are creaky  I think the building is slanted and looks very old  Sometimes you can hear the noises outside and in the passageways  This hotel is in Old Montreal and all the attractions are within walking distance  You can also take the bus right in front of the hotel  We had a room on the third floor  Surprise theres no elevator  We had to drag our heavy bags up several short staircases  So dont take heavy luggage if you can help it  The breakfast was surprisingly good and so were the items on the dinner menu  As for friendliness of staff I couldnt care less Just make sure that you are positive about your booking and that you dont need to keep deposits and dont have to deal much with staff  If you travel from the US you will find most French Canadians quite rude in comparison  Dont expect them to smile or share friendly greetings  Most of them just dont If you ask a question though most people are willing to help  Most of them do speak English  Parking is not cheap in this area  The hotel does not have parking  There is a parking garage on another street close to the hotel that charges  per day  However parking is free on the street at certain hours on weekdays and after six on Saturday before pm on Sunday  You just need to understand the signs in French  The parking meters will take around  per hour for parking  Remember that most signs not all in Montreal are in French  So knowing your north south east west in French as well as the days of the week will be a great help  Most highway signs are in French too 
P => Perfect in Every Way I read the reviews too and I think some people need to get a handle on what they need in a lodging place and book accordingly  The Hotel Champ De s was in a PERFECT location    near everything but super quiet  You should indeed know that check in is before  p m  when the doors are locked but if you make arrangements for late check in they are happy to accomodate  THIS IS NOT A LUXURY HOTEL duh    isnt this obvious from the price What it IS is a clean well kept safe and charming place to sleep while you visit Montreal  I went with a good friend and we knew in advance that the room would be small and only have one bed a queen  That bed was comfortable and clean pillows fluffy and even though we had brought our own pillowcases the sheetspillows seemed clean and soft  We had a third fourth floor room but being from Chicago we live in walk ups anyway and this wasnt a big deal to us  The room had a fabulous window lots of light and nice view  It had a wall mounted TV no phone no clock or radio we had brought our own  Radiant heat was in room with full controls which was nice as it got a little chilly at night and in early morning  Not sure if there was AC it was never hot in the room so we didnt look  The bathroom was clean well appointed enough towels TP shower cap soap shampoo cups and the shower was a reasonable size    and the water was SO HOT unexpected and wonderful  Didnt hear noise from any other rooms dont know how full the hotel was because we tended to get up and out early and come back late sometimes dropping in the afternoon for a restrefreshchange of clothes  Housekeeping brought fresh cups and towels and restocked daily and cutely neatened up our stuff for us  Note for anyone who doesnt know housekeeping staff changes daily at all hotels and it is always a good idea to leave a dollar or two each day rather than one lump sum at the end  Its polite and it  get you better service  We didnt notice any security issues but we didnt bring anything of value really no laptops jewelry etc     i left my ipod passport and some cash in my suitcase after the first day carrying it all and it didnt disappear  I wouldve liked a deadbolt on the door for sleeping but didnt feel unsafe for myself or my things especially with the locked doors downstairs and the requirement of walking up four flights to steal things from our room We arrived at about  a m  on Thursday y rd and were allowed to check in early we had just been planning on leaving our things and coming back at  the posted time  The keys are REAL keys a arate one for the front door locked at  like i mentioned the stairway and the room itself  The woman at the front desk was very friendly and helpful  A couple ahead of us didnt like their room and she changed it immediately dont know how they felt about room   didnt see them again  No problem with reservations or extra weird or unexpected charges  We booked through Travelocity and got the lodging for  nights plus air from Chicago for  each over the y th weekend  Dont know if the front desk has a safe meant to ask but didnt  Glad we didnt put our passports in it though since we left too early for anyone to be there and the front was locked up  I wrote a note wrapped it around our key and left it out on the counter I didnt get charged extra so apparently that was okay  In retrospect we shouldve made arrangements for early check out Breakfast comes included you get your choice of  or so options all with coffeetea and juice included e g  bagel with cream cheese and fruit waffle or pancakes with bacon and fruit eggs with baconsausage and potatoes cold cereal or oatmeal with fruit etc   Breakfast is only served from  to  and the dining room is right downstairs  It seemed to be a restaurant during the other times with bar but we didnt eat there otherwise  Breakfast was good and service friendly  The staff seemed to all be family or at least close friends  They were very pleasant and it was a good way to start the day  If you are used to the Dennys grand slam this will not be enough food for you but we were very satisfied  They give you coupons for your breakfast at check in dont lose them you have to present them upon being seated to the server to get it free  Tip is not included  Generally we found tip was not included in Canada and we hear   is adequate but were from service backgrounds so we probably overtipped The best thing about this place is that it is so close to everything  We flew in and took the aerobus from the airport runs ever  hour and if you buy a round trip ticket its  CAD    dont need reservations for either way pick it up right at baggage claim  The bus stops a few places the train station and one hotel I think before coming to the main bus terminal   UCAMBerri  This is also a main transfer point for the city train lines which are pretty much just like Chicagos organized by color and destination e g  a brown line train to kimball northbound or a brown line train to the loop southbound  Maps are everywhere  A day pass costs I think  be  A ride is like  or so  Sorry I dont remember the specifics  That part was less easy to figure out Im pretty sure there are transfers with single fares in some way but dont know for sure  The city trains go out to the islands and around the city  They are fast clean and nice  The UCAM bus terminal is also where to get the buses to other cities good luck finding a schedule on your own    just ask the information people and theyll hand you one  We took a bus up to Quebec City one day at like  a m     slept on the way  hours and returned home that night last bus back leaves Q C  at  p m  for about  CAD  Definitely worth doing although if we had more time I wouldve liked to stay another day in Q C From the UCAM bus terminal it is about     mile or so to the hotel  Im sure a cab would be cheap but the walk is safe and fine if you are a walker  Be careful the sidewalk is a bike lane in places and those folks FLY    pay attention Head quotsouthquot toward the river its across the street from the giant castle looking building with the copper roof turrets never could figure out what that used to be some sort of government building apparently now abandoned From the hotel its be  mile to the old town and all its restaurants shops and other tourist y stuff  We stayed out pretty late most nights and never felt unsafe walking back either  Its just enough out of the bustle to be quiet but close enough to be convenient and safe We are both women in our s and werent looking for luxury just somewhere safe and clean to sleep while we played tourist  I recommend this hotel   to anyone who is looking for the same  I have nothing at all bad to say about this place would stay there again without reservation and would recommend it to my closest friends although it probably wouldnt suit my mom who likes a little more creature comfort with her hotel suite  
P => Champ de s in Montreal My dhter and I traveled to Montreal in y for a quick getaway and stayed at the Champ de s  Location was our priy objective and the Champ de s is well situated to the undergrounds and a very short walk to the hub of the Old Port A two star hotel Champ de s is not pretentious and the facilities were clean and fairly well kept  Breakfast was fresh and graciously served each day by a very friendy and cheerful staff Would consider staying there on our next visit to Canada  
P => Clean basic  I was in Montreal for an event on rue Champs de s so I picked this hotel for its location and price night using tripadvisors search engine   half the price of other quotbrand namequot hotels  I was in a single room on the second floor  Theres no elevator but its only four stories so its not much of a problem to climb two flights of stairs especially since Montreal is an incredibly walkable city and full of hills    two more flights of stairs isnt much to complain about  The room was very very small a double bed not a queen sized a tiny bed side table and a quot colour tv bolted to the corner of the wall at the ceiling  The bathroom was equally small but all the necessities were there save a hairdryer  The other rooms on my floor were singles like mine or doubles slightly larger but not by much Breakfast was free for guests and huge I never managed to finish a single breakfast while I was there fresh melons and orange slices toast juice hash browns coffee and your choice of eggs amp bacon or french toast or pancakes or cereal or bagels  The staff was friendly bilingual and very helpful with directions  The rooms were clean and didnt smell like smoke something that I was expecting given Montrealers penchant for chain smoking  The location was excellent  blocks away from major metro and bus stops  blocks away from Vieux Montreal and St Paul tourist destination and great boutique shopping  For the bargain traveler that isnt picky about having a huge room and  thread count sheets this was a great hotel and I recommend it if youre looking for a nice clean quiet place to collapse after a long day of hiking and shopping  
P => Perfect for exploring Old Montreal Hotel is just off a main Montreal expressway   very easy to find  Underground parking was around the corner and reasonably priced  Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  Room was clean and tidy  We stayed on third floor which is really four flights of stairs and no elevator  OK bed but great shower  The hotel is one block from Old Montreal so once the car was parked we walked everywhere  The room was small but who cares because we were out on the town There was fresh coffee when we arrived  We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel because there were too many cool cafes to explore  Regardless of earlier reviews there there NO bedbugs NO problem with on line booking NO problem with our credit cards  It was really a neat little hotel and well be staying there again soon  
P => Good Budget Option The Hotel Champ de s has more in common with the budget pensi ns Ive stayed at in Europe than the commercial chains prevalent in North America but it still provides a good budget option in Vieux Montreal  The rooms are admittedly somewhat shabby and small we had to keep our suitcase in the bathroom but it was still fairly comfortable and it amp the en suite bathroom were clean  Breakfast was included with our room cost and was plentiful with a ent selection  Although the staff werent particularly effusive we found them to be helpful and friendly and the Hotel is obviously a family business  The building is quite old formerly a sailors pub and the conversion isnt especially sympathetic although some of the older features still remain in the comfortable hotel lobby  Theres no lift so if you are in the budget rooms on the third floor as we were you get plenty of exercise  All in all not an especially flashy place but a good one to lay your head in after a day spent wandering around Montreal  We booked last minute via a hostel booking site which could account for the reasonable price  
P => Great Location My wife and I stayed at this hotel in e   The location of the hotel was excellent   it was close to old Montreal tourist attractions and the Metro statiion  The staff were friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the hot breaklfast that consisted of bacon eggs pancakes etc  The only minor draw back is the size of the hotel room european style  But you only sleep in the hotel room  I would recommend this hotel and would return when visiting Montreal 
P => Stay away from this hotel We booked this hotel because it looked close enough to the main city at an affordable price  We dont expect a lot from them  Just a nice clean room to rest for the night stuff in the room are working friendly people   thats all  But what we got was a lecture from the lady at the front desk about the importance of tipping a horribly small room with faulty lights  The airconditioning was down for the whole floor and we had to ask them to see the rooms for themselves when they were accusing us for fiddling with the dials I know we paid little for the room but we just needed basic amenities  And we got none from them  
P => It is what it is     We spent a week in Montreal in  of  and stayed at this hotel  We booked it on line as part of a travel package and the price couldnt be beat If I had paid the full rate I would have felt like a victim of highway robbery  But for the price we paid this hotel was just fine It was a little frustrating when we arrived however because we were told that we were getting assigned to a smaller room and we were offered the opportunity to upgrade to a somewhat larger but still quite small room for an additional charge  We ended up opting for the upgrade which was probably just a scam they use but the room was bigger and it came with complimentary breakfast for two On balance I dont regret having stayed there  The location was excellent  The staff members were helpful to us if perhaps a bit stiff  But they were responsive and assisted us with car rentals directions restaurant recommendations etc Truly this place doesnt have the amenities of a full scale Hilton type hotel  There is no elevator the or is dated the rooms even with an upgrade are small  But if you can book this place for a very reasonable rate youll be satisfied with the place and youll really enjoy the location  
P => I loved it First I got this hotel for a great price  This hotel is at a great location and close to all the tourist attractions  Its a very nice and cozy hotel  The rooms are definitely not as big as your conventional big name hotles but this hotel has a character to it  It is a very old hotel and very european style  Breakfasts are amazing  If you want to spend your vacation just sitting in your room this hotel is not your place of course  But if you want to be close to a very nice neighborhood and historic places and you dont want to spend more than  a day this place is absolutely worth it it  
P => just OK This hotel has a very good location if youre looking to stay in Vieux Montreal and its close to a metro station but there are some downsides  All the rooms are at least one floor above ground level and after a day of walking  to  miles to see the all the sites the stairs are daunting  Im glad that I was on the first floor  I couldnt imagine staying on the top level  A big negative was that you always need your keys in hand to even access the door to the stairs no matter what time of day it is  The hotel is surrounded on all sides by apartments converted for the homeless and there are many around  You will never go a day without being asked for change at least five times  The desk clerks were pretty nice to me   contrary to what others have said on here  BUT overall the people of Montreal are the most pretentious judgemental people I have ever come in contact with  The room is extremely small but not uncomfortable  I got this hotel room for a great deal on hotwire com for about  dollars a night the room is worth that but not the standard  dollars a night if you dont have a reservation  But if at all possible avoid this city all together  Its dirty  The people are rude and even mean at times  If you do go to Montreal make sure you know some French because you get treated like a rat if you dont speak the language  
P => the lady at the front desk was mean I stayed at this quothotelquot for two nights  the lady at the front desk she seemed to be the owner was nice at first  it turned out that she was trying to make some extra money by hooking us up with some other tours and airport shuttles  when she realized that we already bought our round trip shuttle bus ticket to the airport and we would be doing our travel independently she got upset  she refused to tell us where the bus terminal was in the neighborhood  basically she kept telling us that she had no idea and the bus terminal was where EVERY bus goes  there was no way that she wouldnt have known that  its called Station Centrale  boul  de Maisonneuve est  You can just walk along Rue Berri for less than  minutes  I think the quality of the hotel is just okay  its cute but they have horrible orations  some molds in the bathroom  but the cleaning was excellent  the breakfast that comes with is not so bad but not so much choice  If I ever go back to montreal I would rather pay a little more for the hotel and get bagles and pastries on my own for breakfast  the location is really good though  there was a young lady who worked in the evening shift and she was really helpful  I think this quothotelquot has very thin walls  You can hear people talking and coughing  
P => Possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  At  its robbery This is not a hotel but the equivalent to the cheapest highway motel except it has four floors  What is lacking here for  per night Everything The rooms are small walls have huge cracks in halls and rooms no hairdryer in bathrooms no coffee maker in the rooms no place to hang clothes except for a coat hook and when we arrived I found that the sheets on our bed had not been changed  Yes its much worse than a hostel  On the bright side breakfast is included and quite good and there is high speed internet  But still not worth it In terms of the front desk help Defensive and ready for a complaint to happenOh yes and you are asked to pay quotin advancequot when you arrive  No wonder 
P => Was fine for what it was  So I booked my trip online for  friends and I  I was quoted at one price and stated we would have two double beds or a queen and a single  When we arrived at the hotel we received a room with a double bed and a fold out cot  It was cramp but relatively clean  The price the told me to pay when we arrived was  different than the one quoted online and i being a fool and tired paid it  For people in the hospitality business they could use some work not very friendly or warm gave very little information regarding the area Doubt i would ever go again  
P => If you are a         this hotel is for you My friend and I stayed here recently  We are students from Toronto and were looking for a clean modest hotel for our trip to Montreal  The location seemed ideal  What could go wrong So rustic and in the old section of Montreal Ive never before been driven to the point of tears by hotel staff or the condition of a hotel  This has to be the absolute worst hotel in the world staffed by the most vile group of people one can imagine  I was prepared to detail every terrible experience here but as I read the reviews that would be pointless and redundant  Do you want to ruin your trip to Montreal and never come back to this city If the answer is yes then this hotel is for you  
P => The Nighte at the Chumps from s I went to Montreal to see my step dhter who is in the hospital and is very ill  When I got there I asked if there was parking Yes was the answer  min on the corner so you can get your things into the hotel but there is a guy across the street that will charge you   a day  The next thing said was I will give you a larger room since you will be here so long I said thank you  When I went up to the room I was devistated it was small and dirty and there were two beds crowed into the room there was barely any room for walking  The stairs were so small I almost fell with my luggage and when anyone took a shower you could here the water in the pipes loud I mean really loud  The staff was so rude and snotty almost like they were better than you  They didnt smile it seems ever  Then on top of all that filt of the rooms and the rude staff when I left and returned home they phoned me a accused me of stealing books from their hotel I was so upset I could have just screamed  What in the hell would I want to steal books from a filty hotel such as this  Then they told me that I had left a earring and should they throw it in the trash what kind of people would say something like this to a customer  I really wanted my earring but I was to hurt to even care anymore so I guess they threw it in the trash   These people are unprofessional and down right rude I would rather sleep on the streets than to go back to this place  The rooms are so small you cant turn around without bumping into a wall  BEWARE DO NOT ENTER quotHOTEL CHUMPS FROM Squot I wonder if this is a real business or some kind of cover up for something else because I cant see how anyone could treat customers this way and expect to stay open  On top of the rooms being very uncomfortable they stare at you all the time and make sure you speak french because they probably are talking about spitting in your food or something with there little giggles  And the high ratings some people are giving are all lies and must be friends of theirs because there is no way a high rating can come from this place  LIES LIES LIES THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN MY WHOLE LIFE AND I TRULLY MEAN THIS  
P => Some good Some bad First the good   Close a five minute walk to a metro station and a  minute walk to the waterfront piers where the boat leave from  A   ride to the Notre Dame baslilica and about a  ride to the heart of the Vieux Montreal old town fine restaurants   A complimentary hot breakfast that was on par with much pricier hotels  Several choices too and the waitres did not charge us more for ordering extra bacon   a generous touch   A fairly comfortabe   although a slightly worn   ambiece that  put some off yet apeal to pothers due to its inherent quirkiness and charm  Now I noticed a few posts which mentioned the rooms being too small   I did not find this was the case with our room  Well our room was well sized and while the facilities were certainly not what you would find in a Hilton the room did have a certain charm about it   A polite homely and helpful staff including the proprietor   Well priced  I did not shop around too much so I really cant say if this is much less expensive than the competition but based on my limited search it seemed to be near the bottom of the price list in the old Montreal area Now the bad  There is no elevator  The stairs are steep and if you are coming back to your room after a hard days sightseeing you crtainy dont want to climb  setsof stairs do you Take a room on the ground or first floor or dont bother with this hotel   There was no bright light in the room  Not good for someone who wants to read  Having said that there were three lamps   I did not notice any parking on the premises   The dinner menu in the restaurant is quite limited and expensive for its class the house beer is just ok and quite expensive and the bar closes at  pm   The neighbourhood seems to be a mix of upket housing and outright poverty  drug abuse  I noticed at least  or so homeless people in the vicinity of the hotel  I feel sorry for these people and will be honest   at no time were they threatening or troublesome  Its just that when one is on a vacation one tends to want to avoid having to come across these unfortunate people who are obviously in such a shameful state due to their chemical dependency  So they are probably more a visual encumbrance than a safety hazard Bottomline If you are a budget traveler and  or need a hotel room for little more than providing a well located place to sleep bathe and breakfast after after a long days sightseeing then the Champs De s hotel will easily suffice  
P => Better Described as  The Night De e Hotel    Stay away from this place  The plan was a romantic getaway with my girlfriend to Quebec City and Montreal  It was all going to plan until we arrived at our hotel Champ De  a term which should be used extremely loosely when describing it in Montreal I searched online and via the Montreal Tourism website and wanted to stay in or near Old Montreal  After reading several hotel descriptions The Champ De  Hotel cht my attention describing itself with a European atmosphere and having been reated a few years ago seemed to be ideal  The hotel online photos seemed to support their description Ive attached photos as theyll save many thousands words Our stay went from bad to worse to worst to absolutely terrible The   star rating not with standing I dont know or understand how this hotel is rated as such because it is not a hotel and more a hostel  Ive stayed in motels with that were much friendlier cleaner and spacious The online hotel description is grossly overstated and absolutely misleading and the photos are certainly well positioned to hide the true nature of this place  Dont be fooled Location    Your not centrally located within Old Montreal in fact the hotel is on the absolute eastern outskirts of the Old Port and certainly not part of the Old Montreal scene and atmosphere Reception and Service   Front desk closes at pm  I checked in after pm and the front doors were locked having to wait for the attendant to finally see me and open the door to let me in     Once I began the check in process the attendant advised me that I had to pay for my two day stay in advance with no refund  I discovered the quotwhyquot within minutes  I found the staff stereotypically French and very indifferent considering were visitors to the city  Fortunately our service experience outside the hotel was very very different Parking   There is no parking at the hotel  You must park your car almost two blocks away in a public parking at   per day and more should you used your car during you stay in Montreal  The walk to the hotel at night is uncomfortable because the street is poorly lit and not part of the well populated tourist area of Old Montreal  Ladies beware No Elevator   Should you ided to experience for yourself this hotel pick a lower floor which to stay  To get to your room you need to use a dark and smelly stairwell that will barely fits yourself with your luggage  And should you encounter someone coming in the opposite direction theres not enough room someone must back up Cleanliness   Generally it should be much much better  Read on Bathroom   See attached photos  Its small with the basic  pieces  We used the plastic cups because they were individually wrapped otherwise we were very careful to touch as little as possible Our Room   See attached photos  Small is the only adjective Ill use  We had a double bed and only space enough to walk down one side     Do not expect to get a good night sleep  The mattress and pillows are the poorest quality and the furniture are not antiques rather someone else garbage  The room is small with sealed windows and therefore no air circulation and extremely stuffy and smelly of body odor    There is no where to hang up your clothes and never the less ided to keep all our clothes in our suitcases     explanation to come read on    The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING especially if youre lucky to find yourself near the stairwell  We were fortunate not to be booked beside a room that had same children and it seemed we were all in the same room    The now for the best if your able to get through all the above that is cramped quarters poor mattress and pillows stuffy and smelly enclosed room and able to close your eyes and fall asleep more from exhaustion then in the morning youll find dozens of BED BUG BITE welts all over your body  Although my girlfriend and I wore our clothing to bed not sleepware our cloths my girlfriend had dozens of bites over her arms feet and torso where her sweater rode up in bed including six on her face  Now ladies and gentlemen how romantic do you think she felt Again stay away from this place Breakfast   Our stay included breakfast which is the only minutely good thing I can write about with you choice of bacon and eggs french toast and pancakes Aunt Jemina    If you expecting Bistro and epicurean cuisine as described in there brochure then if my aunt had wheels shed be a wagon  Many many many better places to have breakfast with much more atmosphere Reations   Just looking at the quality of the materials and workmanship I would guess the material probably came from demolition sites and the workmanship came from summer teenage students with no painting ceramic or construction knowlegde and the furniture and mattresses from garage sales Our Escape for Peace of Mind   For our second night we stayed at the Delta for about   less than I had already paid for at the Champ De   I suggest anyone who is reading this review and the others attached do the same The Champ De  Hotel is better and should more accurately be described as the quotNight De e Hotelquot  And should you ided to ignore not only my experience but the rest of the reviews on Trip Advisor then best wishes and after your experience is over      we all tried to warn you and we told you so  Besides if you want to experience this type of adventure then I suggest camping youll have more room in a tent plenty of fresh air and youll be prepared for bug bites with deet       The Bad       Finding quotHotel Night De equot      The Worse       Staying at quotHotel Night De e      The Worst       You actually pay premium dollars for your stay at the Hotel Night De e       The Terrible       The time youll have if you planned a romantic getaway with that special and significant other in your life and expect any sort of quotamore ce soirquot in the quotHotel Night De equot  It will not happen ladies or gentlemen      The Stupid       Its me for not having consulted Trip Advisor prior to booking the quotHotel Night De equot  Having now read the past quotvictimsquot reviews would have saved much grief in so many ways  My girlfriend still has the welts from the bed bug bites to remind me of our romantic getaway at the quotHotel Night De equot Now youve all now been advised and duly warned  Save yourselves and stay away from this place better and certainly more accurately known as quotThe Night De e Hotelquot  
P => Fine for college students and budget travelers not for those older than  yrs PositivesThe location was great   a  block walk the neighborhood was eerily empty and spooky to the energy and populated Old Port  The hotel was just as close to the Champs de s Metro station but the station was also in a creepy area so take a  minute walk to the busy Berri Uqam Metro Station where three metro lines intersect  There was housekeeping everyday and the bathroom was clean  Toiletries were fine   Pantene samples and generic soaps The staff is also very pleasant  We booked a Grey Line tour and knowing we would miss breakfast they packed a bagel with packets of cream cheese and jam and a bottle of orange juice for us The complimentary breakfast was also nice   there are be  choices and if memory serves the best ones were the toast bacon eggs fruit teacoffee juice choice or the french toast hash brown like french fry cubes fruit teacoffee and juice choice  Fruit consisted of a slice of orange a quarter of a banana and a slice of melon NegativesThe hotel is yellowishly lit and you need a key for the front door of the hotel after  or  p m  a key to enter the stairwell as there is no elevator   the stairwell is also dim has creeky carpeted stairs and smelled like body odor and your room key  They give you only one set of keys so it will be a pain if you or your traveling companion are not attached at the hip and one of you does not have the keys and needs to get into the stairwell to get to your room The rooms are small  We first had a two single beds room but there was barely enough room between the bed and the walls and the room was dimly lit and dilapidated  There was dark flowered wallpaper old furniture no closet to hang your clothes a small bathroom with one shelf to put your toiletries and an quot TV mounted on a stand above the bed  Again this room barely had room for one to walk  I thought that the reviews on this site about the size of the rooms were exaggerated until I saw it for myself  The noise of the heatingair conditioning system roared so much that we could even hear it through our ear plugs and after a terrible night of no sleep had to ask to be changed  I am  years old  I think this place would be PERFECT for the college aged but not at my ripe old age when bright lighting and no body odor become mandatory requirements  After a long day I did not look forward to returning to the hotel which is unfortunate because I thought that the staff and the owner of the hotel were very pleasant Tip Do not stay in a room near the stairwell  The sound of people going up and down the stairs amplifies to an elephant stampede   I am not kidding  And the walls are so paper thin that voices from people talking in the hallway at a normal level will jolt you awake Tip Get a room on the quotfirstquot floor which is the nearest floor to the lobby  I am accustomed and enjoy climbing stairs but it is not a pleasure to walk up and down literally fifty steep steps in a dim smelly stairwell everytime you need to go to your room to get something you forgot or trudge up there after a long tiring day of sightseeing Tip Do not ask the quotconciergequot to book you a Grey Line tour as she will add a  quothotel feequot to do so without advance warning nor your consent  She added the  AFTER she booked the tour for us and it was too late to complain since the service was already done  
P => Good hotel but beware The hotel is nicely located and priced correctly at about  per night  The hotel staff is very nice and friendly and the included breakfast is great  It is indeed walking distance from le vieux port but far from many other worthwhile places in Montreal but Montreal has very good public transportation if you do not have a car  Parking around the hotel is very scarce The hotel internet descriptions claim that it is air conditionned  That is not exactly true  You cannot control the temperature of your own room  I think the temprerature is set for the whole hotel and for me it was too hot most of the time There is no elevator and I have not seen any staff assistance offered for heavy luggage  The rooms are all upstairs so you have to be able to handle a three story climb if you are on the top floor  You are given three keys not the magnetic card keys the old fashion metal keys  one to open the main door one for the stairway to the rooms and one for your own room  There is a charge of  if you lose them  There is a charge of about   for local calls from your room and internet is only available in the lobby not in your room The reception closes at night at  pm you cannot receive any phone calls after that time  The rooms are very small and have no closets or armoires to hang clothes  There are two hooks on a wall for that purpose and a very small chest of drawers  There are no desks  Just a small wall table about  inches wide  There are no ice machines but tap water in Montreal has a good taste and is normally cold enough If you are in Montreal to visit and will only sleep in the room you will probably be fine with this hotel  I expected to do some work on my laptop there and it was very difficult for me Overall do not expect to find the normal amenities found in every hotel room even in a motel  in the US Internet bookings are non refundable so once you are there you are stuck  I recommend booking only one night and leaving yourself the option to stay or to leave open for the other days of your stay  
P => Well maintained but not for the high maintenance types I stayed here for six nights at night on Hotwire rack rate is  CDN and found it perfect as a base to explore the city  I had the smallest room available but it was fine  Ceilings are high bathroom is spacious cleanliness is up to snuff bed is big and comfortable  The free breakfast is excellent  Just excellent  The location is perfect right next to Vieux Montreal and three minutes from a Metro station  If you are there to explore the city and want a clean comfortable room to relax in for a couple hours each night without paying a fortune this is your place  Staff is very friendly too  
P => Good Economy Hotel I think many of the negative reviews of this hotel were generated by people expecting a riot for the price of a Motel   For what my friend and I paid we felt the hotel was more than satisfactory  Our room was quite small but certainly adequate for sleeping dressing and watching a little TV between site seeing trips  The furniture in the room besides the bed was quite sparse a simple wooden chair small dresser and night stand but it served its purpose  Our room did not smell or appear dirty and the plumbing worked fine as did the cable TV  Considering the large included breakfast and the conveinent  minute walk to the Champ de s metro station it is a ent value  My only complaint was that the hotel bar was kind of expensive and closed rather early pm  I would recomend this hotel especially to students young people or anyone looking to enjoy Montreal on a low budget for a few days and who doesnt mind forgoing a few frills  
P => Stay away and watch yourself Just returned from Montreal stayed in Champ de   The location of the hotel is good a few steps from Old Montreal  The second good thing is breakfast  All the other things are terrible  The rooms are small thats OK and extremely smelly with the strong smell of cheap odorizer  Air condition was hardly felt  And you cant open the window The window is closed forever  I was unable to stay in the room more then  minutes  On reception I was told that windows are closed for security reasons  It was impossible to cancel the reservation because of cancellation fee of    Interestingly for additional  I was given a room with a small window amenable to opening probably the security situation in this room was different Stay away and watch yourself 
P => Absolute nighte  
P => Hotel Champs De   
P => Wonderful  
P => Sufficient  
P => Hotel Champs De s  
P => Arnaque et vol autoris   
P => tres mauvais accueil  
P => 
P => Basic hotel This new hotel is clean and attractive  Staff is friendly  The rooms have large refrigerators and in room computers with French keyboards  The wireless internet worked well  The bed was comfortable  The hotel doesnt have many amenities besides a basic free breakfast and an adequate workout room  Its simple but nice and comfortable It is located only a half block from the Palais de Congres convention center and the Place DArmes Metro stop  Its only a few blocks from Vieux Montreal Old Town and also close to the center of downtown  A great location is you want to see different parts of the city  I highly recommend the Hotel Le Dauphin 
P => Great value My cousin amp I stayed here for a weekend getaway  I picked this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor  Fantastic The location was great being a block away from a metro stop and Old Montreal  In fact Rue Ste  Catherine was only   blocks away as well  The room was spacious clean modern and relatively new  The beds were firm amp comfortable  The bathroom was a little small but stylish with Grohe fixtures  be it was a slow weekend but the hotel was super quiet  I specifically asked for a quiet room and boy did I get one The continental breakfast was okay I opted for a banana and some tea  Because of the great value of the room I indulged myself by going out for breakfast  Having an internet connected computer in the room was wonderfully useful hope this is a trend in other hotels Overall I was very happy with my stay and wouldnt hesitate to return to this hotel 
P => Great location clean modern hotel  This hotel is in a fantastic location right beside the congress centre and in between old town and shopping on Ste  Catherine The rooms were great   clean modern and the in room computer was a nice touch  Since there are only a small number of rooms on each floor it was nice and quiet We were a bit disappointed with the quality of the toiletries provided I would have expected something a little higher end to be more in line with the vibe of the hotel The breakfast was good however be warned that they treat holidays like weekdays and not weekends so we were a bit disappointed to have missed breakfast on the holiday Monday  
P => Absolutly Lovely  very nice clean hotel  great location friendly staff  offered an umbrella when raining  gave resturant suggestions  breakfast was ok  
P => Clean and Modern My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in Montreal after much back and forth over where to stay  I ended up booking this hotel based on all of the positive reviews but really had no idea what to expect upon arrival  It was a bit tricky to find mostly because my gps was a little cranky and because its a smaller hotel with an unassuming entry but once we were inside I was more than impressed  The or was simple and modern and everything looked brand new and clean  My favorite feature was the beautiful bathroom and the glass shower  I also was very impressed with the fact that we had a computer with free wireless a fridge a safe and a huge flatscreen tv in the room  For what we paid this was more than what we were expecting  We only made it to the continental breakfast one morning but we were happy with it  There wasnt any coffee left but upon letting the staff know they made a fresh batch for us  The front desk staff was helpful and they all spoke English  Parking wasnt too much of an issue either  We bought pre paid tickets from the hotel and were able to park in the convention center garage next door which is a really great building as well We had no issues whatsoever  The location of the hotel was excellent as well  We were located right next to the subway system and a block or two away from Notre Dame and Old Montreal  It was the perfect spot My one complaint is that housekeeping did come to our floor really early one morning which I thought was weird  But I cant even be too sure of that because I was half asleep still  And a pool would have been nice but at least there was air conditioning that cooled down the room very fast  If you are looking for a very reasonably priced hotel that is clean comfortable and has modern ammenities then I would recommend this place in a heartbeat  If I return to Montreal I would def  stay there again  
P => MontreawesomeCest Parfait Stayed for  days with  teens  Hotel location was perfect  Room was big  queens  Great breakfast  Staff was superb all around friendly and helpful  Could walk to the old city sites several blocks to the south and to the city center for shops and restaurants several blocks north  Entrance a block away in convention center to Metro walk thru underground city to McGill for college visit and then north through the Park to the Chateau for awesome view of the city  LONG walk uphill on rocky road wear comfy shoes  We rented bikes from bixi stop outside the convention center a block away  each and biked down to the waterfront for a fab ride during a rainstorm  Ride to the end opposite Molson and get a lobster sandwich and clam chowder then back on the bike  Fireworks Sat night  walk or cab  from hotel down Rene Levesque to the park and watch from the grass  Latin Quarter has lots of ethnic restaurants  Museaum whistory of city a MUST teens loved it  day park around corner in convention ctr    
P => Excellent location   excellent facilities Only thing missing is a pool   but the rooms are great and in a very central locale for all the events of Montreal  And great price compared to the over priced places around it  
P => hidden gem nice modern or great amenities I picked this hotel for the location and also for other amenities that come with it  This hotel is a no fuzz hotel  The staff was always there but would not be in too much of your way    perfect for quiet no fuzz travelers  The breakfast was very hearty with a great variety of different kinds of juices drinks toast baked beans etc  The most surprise of all was that the hotel provided a desktop computer in every room  If you bring your own laptop you can unplug the Ethernet cable from the desktop and plug it into your own laptop  The room has in room safe  The hotel looks new  oration is modern style with very clean room and bathroom and a nice soft fluffy bed  I loved it and will stay there again if I have a chance  
P => Great value great location great place This hotel was reated in  location is great  minute walk to Old Montreal  Room was large and super clean with  comfortable queen beds a spacious bathroom with huge shower Flat Screen TV and computer  Room was quiet staff very pleasant and helpful continental breakfast with juices cereals some fruit and bread etc  Overall a great deal   would definitely stay here again in Montreal  
P => Good deal   nice place This was just what I expected pleasantly  A large loft like room orated in a very contemporary soothing way but not fancy  Essentially Hotel Ikea  Everything worked fine the bathroom is huge with a great shower etc  If youre looking for top tier materials and amenities and quality pay more somewhere else  If youre looking for a very comfortable workable affordable place to stay very convenient to downtown and Old Montreal and not far from the Village convenient to the Metro stay at Hotel Dauphin  We got the most expensive room which was on the top floor and had a arate sitting area with a leather sectional and extra TV night  The computer in the room was handy  The staff was friendly and helpful and efficient  
P => I loved this hotel Close to everything and was such a clean place w free Breakfast I stayed here for Memorial day weekend and I fell in love  The Hotel was in a perfect location  I think the farthest thing we walked to was  minutes  We were three blocks away from the Notre Dame Basilica  The lightshow was really nice  Only  and it was worth it though you have to sit through a little history lesson  The show its really amazing  From the Hotel old montreal is about  minutes walking distance  The Port is very lovely to walk up and down on  They have a new bike system where people can rent bikes I believe up to  hours  I must warn you that there is a deposit of  so if you plan on renting the bikes make sure you use your credit card and not your debit needless to say we flipped out with we saw the charge  It takes from   hours for the pending charges to be removed once the bikes are returned to any station  I would def  rent the bikes again  It was a great time ill just make sure to use my Amex lol  Catherine street is about  blocks away this is where you will find the shopping stores Old Navy Puma foot locker  Crescent street is filled with bars and restaurants The subway or metro was so easy to navigate we had no problem getting to the Biodome on it another place you should check outThe Hotel itself was very clean  The staff was always friendly and said hi  Check in and out were smooth and our room was ready at like  There is a free newspaper delivered every morning and there is complimentary breakfast cereal toast muffins bagels juice tea and coffee Its enough to keep you full until lunch The Hotel has parking downstairs but there were able  so depending on how many people are at the hotel with cars you  be in luck and it was only dayThe beds were extremely comfortable  The showers were very clean and the tv was big  AND there is a computer in your room with FREE internet There is also a fridge and safe  I felt right at home and the next time I come to Montreal I will def  stay at this hotel  I feel like im leaving tons of things out  There was so much to do  We didnt have a set schedule of things to do we just went with the flow  and it worked out perfectly  The people are very friendly and laid back If you have any questions let me know 
P => Excellent value  location The suite was spacious and at the cost of a regular room anywhere in downtown Montreal  You get A LOT for your money     a computer with internet a jaccuzi free breakfast two televisions spacious room spacious shower etc  A real bargain 
P => Great hotel with lots of amenities in a good location reasonable price Stayed here with some friends and shared a room with  double beds  The check in was quick and easy and we were given  room keys  The room was just as pictured and very clean  Great water pressure in the shower and the computer with internet in the room was a great feature  The room also has a mini fridge and in room safe  The alarm clock has a docking station for an i pod and when it goes off it starts out quiet and works up to a louder volume and was pleasant to wake up to The breakfast bar had more than enough selection  Location is close to everything we needed particularly Old Montreal and Cirque du Soleil  We got parking but the small lot is very tight for a big carSUV  We were allowed to keep our car in the lot for the remainder of our visit after we checked out for just  a great deal in the downtown for parking if you are going to walk around  This was a great hotel with lots of amenities in a good location with a very reasonable price for what you are getting  
P => Clean and pleasant boutique hotel close to the old city  We my husband and  and  year old children stayed at the Hotel Dauphin for two nights over a very cold easter weekend  The hotel was very clean and the young women at the front desk were very helpful and kind  They all spoke both french and english  The room was somewhat small but nicely and simply orated  We had two king beds with soft linens two chairs and the TV and computer  The bathroom was very pretty but dark  There was no light in the shower stall  We were given keycards for security which allowed us to use the elevator open the door and turn on the lights  The breakfast was filled with mostly carb related foods   cereal breadbagelhomemade muffins   and some yogurt beans cheese and apples  The location of the hotel was very convenient  We were in walking distance to the old city where there were many restaurants souvenier shops and historic buildings  The very good science museum was close by  The metro was also very close  We were able to walk to other parts of the city as well  Overall we had a very positive impression of this hotel  
P => Great boutique hotel in downtown Montreal Stayed at the Hotel Dauphin for  nights in ober   The location was excellent   just a short walk from both Notre Dame and St Catherines Hotel is very new and modern  Rooms were large and well appointed  Nice TV and a computer with free internet in the room were highlights  Free Breakfast was excellent Check inout was quick   staff were very friendly and helpful and bilingual Highly recommend the Dauphin if you are looking for a great location between Old Montreal and St Catherines  
P => Great value for a hotel by conference center We stayed here for a conference in tember   It was less than a block away from the conference center so it was quite convenient in that respect  It was only a  minute walk away from the major shopping area  The hotel was always clean and quiet and the front desk staff was friendly  We forgot to bring an umbrella with us but we were able to rent one from the front desk with a monetary deposit which was returned when we returned the umbrella  Nice idea There was complimentary internet and breakfast every day    the breakfast bar always included beans which is apparently quite common in Quebec  
P => Quality Hotel  A clean hotel at a reasonable price  Right off the main street so a good location but also very secure  With your curtains closed you are sure to forget that you are even in the middle of a city  Breakfast was minimal but otherwise a great place for the price  
P => Modern conveniently located hotel We stayed at the Hotel Dauphin for  nights during tember   Location is great   near the convention centre and walking distance of the Old TownReception Staff Pleasant fluent in english amp french which is very helpful  Room Modern clean and a ent size  The bed was king size and very comfortable with clean and soft sheets  Room had flat screen tv free wireless internet computer in the room  Lovely modern double shower room however a light in the shower area would have been even better  As an added bonus there was a continental breakfast included  
P => Liked the Hotel Dauphin I stayed in the Hotel Dauphin for two nights during the first week of tember   Location is great   right near the convention centre and other hot spots in downtown Montreal  The hotel must have been really reated recently  Everything seems new  Very modern very clean  Room was huge flat screen tv free wireless internet very nice bathroom  Bed was comfortable  No view out of my room or any others as far as I could tell  No mini bar  However a very nice breakfast was included  I thought the price was excellent too I recommend this hotel  
P => Great Spot for downtown shopping Great little hotel    modern and very clean   minutes away from shopping on St  Catherines street  Free internet access in rooms was unexpected and welcomed  Free breakfast was very convenient bagels toast juice coffee fruit etc  Overall a great spot if youre looking for something close to shopping and not too costly  Would definitely recommend it  
P => Great location great hotel We returned on     from an  day stay at Hotel Le Dauphin on Rue de Bleury in downtown Montreal and I cant say enough about how it was a great choice  My mom in her s myself in my mid s and my two dhters ages  and  all loved the hotel  I chose it specifically because it was the only hotel in Montreal I could find that offered  queen beds standard  I ended up booking it online I think room was about  per night as my travel agent couldnt find me anywhere that had anything but  double beds and we wanted to stay in  room Not only was the room clean new I believe the hotel only opened in   Everything seemed new well orated with luxurious bedding and a beautiful bathroom they also provide a computer with internet access in each room at no additional charge as well as a flat screen cable TV with DVD player and a refrigerator plus  bottles of water per day in your room free  They have breakfast everyday in a nice breakfast room from  to  am and it includes cereals croissants bagels toast fruit beans coffee tea and juices  They offer some snacks sodas bottled water candy for sale in the lobby  There is also a washing machine and dryer behind a door in the lobby restroom can only enter with your room keycard in case you need that and laundry soap available for sale in the lobby too  The hotel staff are French speaking but the staff in the reception area all speak fluent English too  It is also located in a great place  It is one block from Palais de Congres Montreal Convention Center which is across the street from a great fountain that was originally created for the Olympics and is covered in steamy smoke and a ring of fire each night at least it was when we were there  Not sure if it is seasonal  We were also within  to  blocks of  subway stops on two different lines which made getting around on the metro which is very clean and safe and easy to take    even my mom went alone to the casino by subway and bus very easy The underground mall including shops and cafes at Desjardins on Boulevard Renee Levesque is within  blocks and you can walk through it to get to Place DArts subway stop we were directed by hotel staff  The main tourist sites of Vieux Montreal Old Montreal are also within easy walking distance of the hotel about   blocks depending on where you are going and if you go out the hotel door and turn right and right around the haunted house next door you will see Chinatown within about  block Though not much was mentioned about Chinatown in guidebooks it has good Chinese restaurants and even bakeries  This hotel is ideal if you do not need a real concierge all the staff at the reception desk are helpful and have maps and guidebooks but there is not a real concierge and do not need a restaurant or pool right in the hotel  I  try to talk my husband into going back for our th anniversary this fall 
P => Nice for the Price We stayed at the Dauphin during the Jazz Festival  its in a very convenient location just a few blocks from the festival with China Town and Old Town also very close  The complimentary breakfast was fine offering fruit coffee yogurt pastries and cold cereal  There is parking available at the nearby convention center for day  The parking onsite was sold out  The rooms were comfortable and clean with a mini fridge safe and flat screen TV  The bathroom had a nice walk in shower  One complaint   the gym is a little creepy  Its in a windowless interior room thats a little smaller than one of the guest rooms  Could be a little weird if theres more than one person in there at a time  Overall a nice place to stay with very reasonable rates  Well probably consider staying here the next time we go to jazz fest  
P => Great Hotel This a great hotel and great value  The rooms are spacious with superb amenities i e  a computer with free internet connection a modern inroom safe refrigerator a beautifully furnished bathroom with state of the art shower fixtures comfortable beds etc  The exterior is very modest and initially a turn off because it is tangent to a closed out and what appears to have been an amusement haunted house complete with ghouls hanging our of windows and intentional graffiti I think on the walls  It is located on a fairly calm street and consequently traffic noise is not a factor  We were on the fourth floor facing the street and we couldnt hear any traffic on weekends as well as weekdays The location is terrific and negates having a car  About  easy minutes walk to Old town and a myraid of resturants and shops   minute walk to Chinatown     minute walk to the train station and a  minute walk to a Metro station  The Chinatown had a some good resturants and a particularly neat bakery which offered these warm rolls with bacon and other stuff on it   they were delicious and cost about   each  Also try their custard tarts for a  each  The area immediately around the hotel felt very safe to me and we my wife and I often walked to and from at night without feeling threatened at any time The staff of this hotel is warm and friendly  I felf genuinely welcomed  I would definitely come back if I ever visited Montreal again and would recommend this place to anyone  
P => Excellent downtown hotel with free computer and internet Right in the middle of Montreal downtown a few blocks away from the Old Town Art center conference center and Chinatown  Very clean nice interior design inexpensive  Free computer and internet in every room Okay free continental breakfast The room is nice but not quite spacious which I guess is okay for a downtown hotel Parking is  but you can find cheaper parking closeby  Meters are very expensive  an hour but public parking is  a day  
P => Underrated ided to try out this somewhat unknown hotel and I was pleasantly surprised  It seems like it is pretty new as the rooms or building are all in good shape The area is right downtown and from the outside the hotel doesnt look like much  Its a smaller hotel with nine floors and about  rooms per floor be The room was designed with a modern IKEA like style  Not a big room but well kept and well equipped  I was surprised to see they offered a new Dell Dimension PC keyboard and LCD as part of the standard package along with hi speed internet  LCD TV mini fridge safe cordless phone alarm clock were nice features  The bathroom was modern as well with Grohe hardware in the sink and shower which was a funky glass enclosure I must say the mattress and linens were just okay   ive had softer more luxurious hotel beds for sure The staff was friendly and flexible and let me have a pm checkout which was perfect to take a noon conference call from my room Continental breakfast is also offered and parking is underground    but only  spots or so available You had to use your passkey in the elevators parking garage etc  and I saw they had videocameras all around too for security reasons I thought it was pretty good value for the location and would stay there again  
P => Wonderful Dont be put off by gloomy reception  Cant recommend this hotel highly enough for the huge room and the facilities  Dont be put off by the gloomy reception area and rather neutral receptionists  This is a very new hotel and the usual modern facilities iron and board hair dryer kettle coffee tea are exceeded by an in room programmable safe plasma TV and your own computer  This last was an absolute boon  Complimentary newspapers left outside your room and self serve breakfast in the breakfast room offers a wide choice of options  Exercise room equipped with three machines  Good location between  Metro stations and in walking distance of Chinatown and central shopping district  I stayed in  hotels in Canada and this was by far the most luxurious and the best  
P => Great Location Clean Modern Rooms Good Value Le Dauphin is a clean newer modern hotel in a prime location  If you are having a convention you couldnt pick a better place because it is just steps away from the Convention Center  My family and I walked to Vieux Port Rue Ste  Catherine and Chinatown in minutes  The bed was soft with white linens possibly it was a down comforter  There was a nice LCD television and small flat screen computer with internet access  The bathroom shower was chic with its stone tiling and glass wall  Having only stayed one night I found it quiet for that night and did not have any loud neighbors  There was no swimming pool but our room had a view of the adjacent condos rooftop pool  Too bad Parking was a small journey since we had to park in the convention center garage but it wasnt a big deal  The continental breakfast was really good especially the muffins and bagels  Stay here for convenience cleanliness good value and comfort  
P => Great amenities perfect for business travellers I was pleasantly surprised to find such a great hotel  Done in a boutique style they really go over the top to give you the little extras especially for the price  Ive never actually had a real hair dryer in a hotel room before I stayed in the King suite and the leather lounging area was great for relaxing  The free internet in my room was a nice little addition as well  A bit more down budget the service isnt much but the price is great  Staff when needed is terrific Location isnt the greatest but youre still within a  minute walk to the downtown core and Old Montreal  If youll be at the Palais de Congres however its a perfect location  
P => Excellent Location and Reasonable Price We have stayed here for  nights and we love itPros New and stylish hotel with excellent location only  mins walkto the Metro station Place des Armes  mins walk to the Notre Dame breakfast was complimentary and was served from am free access to the laundry machines you need to ask the front desk for the key to use the machines computer with internet connection inside each guest room flat screen TV DVD player super comfortablebeds and friendly staff Cons breakfast could have been a little better not enough barsrackshooks to hang the towels and clothes inside the bathroomThe pictures shown in their websites are exactly the same as they are  
P => What a surprise Was not sure whether or not to stay at the Hotel Dauphin as their website does not really promote a professional image of the hotel  However I can say that this hotel was quite a great findRooms are very new and well equipped   comfortable king bed large refrigerator LCD TV a computer yes with free internet and a nicely finished bathroom View from the room was not great actually the only thing I could see was the wall of another building and breakfast which is included in the rate is quite basic  However the location and quality of the hotel are fantastic for the price  Would recommend  
P => superbe  
P => Hotel   recommander proche de tout   Id al pour visiter Montr al  
P => estupendo  
P => Ottima location ottimo hotel  
P => Impeccable   
P => 
P => travel alert This is the sleaziest hotel Ive ever stayed in  Bedbugs   broken window latch   I can vouch that these are all true  For your own safety and peace of mind please spend the extra dollars and book your stay at a commercial hotel  Spare yourself the added stress We certainly learned our lesson Hotel de LElysee should be closed down 
P => Bed bugs Dont stay I have stayed at many hotels in montreal   ranging from Taj Mahal to Hotel Gault and this has to be the most disgusting experience Ive ever had We booked for the ust long weekend and ended up leaving after the first night  Please dont get fooled by the ideal location it is a pig sty and infested with bed bugs  we didnt notice them until the next morning when I and my friend were literally covered with oozing welts on our faces and necks  We called for the manager who never came  We demanded that someone come up to see the headboard and bed and nobody came  We finally had to go down to the front desk and get the owner on the phone  The staff was unfriendly and spoke little englishfrench  I thought it fishy that they tried to charge me three nights in advance  Do not sign anything until you inspect your room  If you dont want your vacation ruined and you dont want nasty oozing bites on your face STAY ELSEWHERE 
P => Worst hotel stay ever prosstrategically located reasonably pricedconspaper thin walls   if anyone is up     you are up  Its not a hotel it is a row home with hotel rooms in it slightly seedy neighborhoodunhelpful staffbreakfast is     no joke    wonder bread a toaster and horrible coffeehard to commuicate with front desk english or french    when some one is even there I was very dissappointed with this Hotel  Where do I start  Well let me start by saying this is my first review despite using tripadvisor many times  I felt I needed to save the next guy the headache I got with this hotel  I suspect that the ratings of this hotel  have been pumped up by friends or relatives of the owner because I usually find the reviews here to be on the money  I would also like to add that I have stayed at many value hotels before but there are certain expectations that even a value hotel should meet  First of all it is indeed strategically well located  However its immediate neighborhood is a little seedy  I felt like I needed to explain myself to wife as to why out hotel was in between rundown houseshotels which homeless people are living in boarded up windows and all and drug deals and hookers about at nightime Then there is the room  The toilet ran constantly and room had about two feet of space outside the parimeter of the mattress  Worst of all the walls were paper thin  You could hear conversations going on in other rooms  We were awaken several time throughout the night by people coming in all ours of the night coming up the steps carrying on drunk talk  Any normal hotel walls would blocked those sounds out  I tryed to converse with the front desk on several occasions and it was hit or miss depending on who was there and it was mostly miss  English or french  I got a parking ticket despite asking several times if my parking space was ok  Plus apon leaving I discovered my car had been struck while parkedTo be fareThis hotel was less then a block from the metro which is handy  It was a block from st denis which has many restaurants and shops  It was  tax canadian when many other hotels wanted about tax during the weekend of the th of y All and all I wouldnt stay here for free because I couldnt even get one restful night the whole time I was there  
P => Its a bit out of town The location of this hotel was a bit far out of the city for my liking  Although only a  minute walk or three metro stops it was too far for a tourist in winter with only three days to see it all  Although the street was safe and only  minute walk from the metro stop I would much rather stay closer to the city centre  This is a very old building that has been recently reated  It does need a lift however its not fun lugging your bags up all those stairs  The guys at the front desk are really nice they let me use their internet for free  The room was quiet and spacious  The bathroom was rather small in comparison  I would not stay here again only due to the hotels out of town location  
P => Bad experience I have just arrived from wonderful trip to Montreal  Unfortunately Hotel de LElysee was not part of the quotwonderfulquot equation  I had booked this hotel because I was looking for a cheaper place to stay as I was only staying one night and wanted the basics  I read all the reviews on Tripadvisor carefully so it seemed to fit  I always use the tripadvisor reviews before booking a hotel and have never been disapointed  Once I arrived I did have help from one gentleman who helped bring my luggage up the stairs  I asked him if there was and breakfast and he said no  That was fine with me but I did think it odd as it was mentioned in the other reviews that they provided a small breakfast  Once I got back in from my meetings I was looking forward to sleeping as I had an early and busy day the next day  At   AM in the morning I woke up absolutely freezing  The weather was about   degrees outside and it felt that cold inside also  I went to call downstairs to see what was happening and I realized that my room had no electricity So I got up out of bed went downstairs  While I was going down I realized that the two floors below me were heated Once I arrived to the main level there man behind the counter who proceeded to tell me that the electricity was now put on again  What Why did he turn off the electricity on my floor How unbelievable is that It took forever for the room to heat up  It also took me over an hour to fall asleep this time fully dressed with my pyjamas and my sweater on and jacket on top of the two bed sheets provided  The next morning I didnt even get an apology from the same man who was there at   AM or was asked how my stay was  I am polite flexible and dont have a chip on my shoulder  I am usually very happy wherever I stay  I have stayed in different types of hotel ratings from hostels to the Four Seasonsfive star I will never ever again stay in this hotel and I will never recommend it  
P => Very friendly and clean I went with a group of friends  in total  We stayed in  rooms  Elysee was one of the few clean and ent small hotlsbed amp breakfast  Upon our return in the evening there would be a clean sets of towels  Upon request they would bring up a hair dryer pretty quickly  Some of us knew French BUT were rusty  Cesar amp Eddie were friendly and nice enough to call local restaurants and tour places for us  We were also able to leave messages for each other at the front desk  The place is not in the center of things but it was easily accesible  Would go again  
P => Great value and location We would definitely stay in this hotel again  The room was very clean though small  The location was great  Parking not a problem we got a spot on the street right in front of the hotels entrance  Good free coffee and croisants in the morning  The only complaint was towels the size of washcloths would bring my own next time  Overall this is a great limited service hotel that is perfect for travelers who only like to use their hotel room as a place to sleep and shower  
P => Great hotel for a great price We were only going for a weekend and we just found this hotel on expedia  We checked the ratings and ided to give it a shot  Who wouldve thought that the hotel would turn out this great  We were so impressed  The staff there was very friendly the rooms were clean and just the right size and the hotel was close to everything  We would definetly go back again and recommend it to other travellers who are heading to Montreal  
P => ent room surly attitude My dhter and I stayed here for our last night of a  day trip to Montreal amp Quebec City  Earlier part of the trip stayed at the excellent Hotel XIX Siecle in Vieux Montreal but ided to save money for our last night  Chose this hotel based on good reviews for value and cleanliness  Place was a bit shabbierplainer than we expected from the reviews but overall room cleanliness was very good for the price  Unfortunately construction going on across and up the street awakened us at AM with very loud digging equipment saws etc  but thats not the hotels fault  The surly attitude by the morning front desk person makes me give this place a resounding negative  First he knocked on our door to inform us that check out time was AM  as if we had overstayed when in fact it was  minutes before  and we were preparing to leave  Then he yelled at us for using an upstairs exit door and stairway to bring down a large suitcase  The desk person the day before had allowed us to use this more convenient and less narrowtwisty staircase when we checked in and we assumed it was ok to take the same route for our departure  The indoor stairway is very narrow and winding and I feared that Id scrape the walls with my suitcase if I had to bring it up amp down that way  I apologized and tried to explain to him that we had been given permission by the gentleman working the desk the day before but he just repeated that we were quotneverquot to use that exit and that he didnt care what wed been told  Note that I am a woman traveling with my  year old dhter and we did not ask for nor expect any assistance with the suitcase  I would never stay here again due to his lack of courtesy and overall sour attitude  
P => Hotel de LElysee   Highly Recommended When we visited Montreal recently we were looking for hotel with reasonable rates close to the Old City  TripAdvisor reviews of this hotel were consistently positive and we ided to take a chance  Were very glad we did and we would definitely stay at the Hotel de lElys e again Not only is the location great   just a stones throw from the fabulous restaurants of rue St Denis and a mere   minute walk from the Old City   but the staff is outstanding  Many of the TripAdvisor reviews laud Sam at the front desk and rightly so  Sam ROCKS The moment we showed up he was there to let us in and help us up the stairs with our bags  He was an invaluable source of information on everything from where to eat to where we could find a free parking spot for the whole weekend  The entire staff was friendly and pleased to speak in both English and French they were extremely tolerant of  mon fran ais mal I was travelling with two other people and we had a room with one queen and one double bed  The room was small but clean and charming with a private bath TV and phone and the rate was excellent  If youre not able or willing to climb stairs you  wish to request a room on one of the lower floors ours was on the top fourth and we didnt mind the exercise  Free parking was available including overnight all weekend just a few steps away on both sides of rue St Hubert  There is also a cute restaurant practically next door that serves early breakfast   we found Montreal does not rise early on the weekend It rained to beat the band Saturday afternoon but the location on St Hubert is also a great starting point for an auto tour of the citys sights not far from Sherbrooke if you want to see the Olympic Village or from Mont Royal if you want to tour the swanky heights  And Ile St Helene is just across the Jacques Cartier Bridge by car if you want to check out the Biosphere or Habitat  Hotel d LElys e is no frills great value and perfect for the traveller who is on the go  Wed highly recommend it and book ahead We will be next time we visit Montreal  
P => Very Convenient Hotel  Everything is close by  Subway bus station restaurants old Montreal etc  Very very clean  Friendly staff  We had a good time  
P => Hotel de LElysee is the best deal in town My girlfriend and I spent a lovely  days in Montreal over the Labor Day weekend  We chose Hotel de LElysee due to its previous reviews on TripAdvisor com and its wonderful location  The hotel was fantastic The rooms were VERY clean and the staff was really helpful and friendly The desk manager went out of his way to find restaurants and parking for us He also gave us great suggestions as where to eat and places to visit in his city  I would highly suggest staying at Hotel de LElysee if you choose to visit Montreal  It is located in the heart of the Latin Quarter and only two blocks from St  Denis one of the hippest areas of Montreal  We had a great time and will stay at Hotel de LElysee whenever we visit Montreal 
P => Great Place to stay My Husband and I recently spent  days at the Hotel De L Elysee in Montreal Canada  I found it through trip advisor and it had some good reviews  The hotel is very clean the beds are super comfortable and Sam the manager was terrific  If we needed anything he would practically run to our room to provide it and even checked out parking spaces for us parking is not included but there is a lot nearby  It has little in the way of amenities no gym room service etc but for those of us who spend most of out time out of the hotel its perfect  The price is extremely reasonable and the location is great   several blocks from major restaurants and within walking distance of Old Montreal  We will certainly stay there again nnooodles 
P => Very Clean Great Staff Ext  Accomodating I was not expecting much because the price was so inexpensive but I was pleasently surprised  At arrival the host saw me struggling with my luggage and asked if he could help  I lined and he assured the help was at no cost I guess he sensed my gun shyness  He also walked me to a parking spot on the block and helped me squeeze into a spot that would let me park for free for a few nights  The room was small but who cares it was just me and my wife and we spent all of our time except sleeping in the town BUT most importantly the room was very clean and the bathroom was spotless  The hotels location is very convenient the metro stop Berri Uquam is right up the block  All in all this hotel experience left me feeling very satisfied and the whole Montreal vacation in general was amazing  Great Fun 
P => Great value and location My friend and I stayed at Hotel de LElysee in the Latin Quarter district for  days from    and had a large room that was clean and had a nice bathroom that had been recently reated  The location was great as this brown stone hotel was half a block away from the Berri UQAM metro station and the bus station  In addition it was two blocks from Rue St Denis where there are a lot of great stores restaurants and bars Eddy at the hotel was extremely friendly and would offer suggestions for site seeing and for restaurants  I would recommend this hotel as it is a basic no frills hotel that is clean good value for your money the staff are helpful and the location is great  
P => Amazing value great location fantastic staff  
P => Such a great value  
P => Fair enough for low season  
P => loved the hotel  
P => Tres mauvais hotel  
P => Beaucoup mieux que LAnn e Passer  
P => Beware of the Bed Bugs  I thought I lucked out getting a cheap hotel in downtown Montreal but it was all bad luck The room I stayed in was infested with bed bugs I woke up scratching at over  bites on my back shoulder arm and foot  I even found a couple of the critters dead on the bed and blood spots on the sheets   my blood I had to spend the next morning washing all my clothes and disinfecting my luggage before I could bring it home  I couldnt sleep for a week and will never stay in cheap hotel again Traveller beware  
P => Great place to stay This hotel is very simple and is situated in an old turn of the century house and has kept some of its charms for example the ceiling in the reception breakfast area is amazing with its Titanic style globe and the hotel still has its old staircases and some of the old fireplaces are still in place though not functionnal  Our room was simple but clean and confortable and the people at the reception very agreable helpful and fun  I was satisfied with the service and I believe it is a good value for travellers who come to Montreal  On top of that you are close to everything since you are downtown I recommend this hotel for its good qualityprice ratio and for the nice people who work there  
P => ugly filthy unsafe dive I was shocked and sickened by the condition of this place  It was dirtyhad bugs in the room and looked as though it was not cleaned for days  The people at the front desk were not helpfull and would not help me with my complaint  Avoid this dive  as it is filthy and unsafe  NOT WORTH STAYING AT ANY RATE  unless you are a crackhead STAY AWAY 
P => 
P => Great location nice hotel but poor value I booked it through expedia and got the rd night free  Breakfast was supposed to be free but once we got there they charged us  for each breakfast since we didnt book it directly from the hotels website  They didnt tell us that upon checking in  If you didnt bring your own toothbrush amp toothpaste youd have to buy them from the minibar same goes for shaving kit The location is great as Rue Crescent is around the corner many barsrestaurantscafes the metro and the underground mall are also a couple of blocks away  In the end we ended up paying the equivalent for the rd night through breakfast and parking night  
P => Perfect location Wonderful stay The Hotel De la Montagne is PEFERCT if you like clean comfortable great staff and walking proximity to the best food and shopping in Montreal If you are a looking for a variety of night life you are within steps of Thursdays barnightclub underground passage so ladies can leave their coat and purse in the room or right on the hotel main floor is a rocking bar where we enjoyed dancing to a great duo  Our room was spacious and quiet with the most comfey bed  We will definitely stay here again  
P => Great location quiet comfortable and clean I stayed at the de la Montagne visiting friends and i was very pleased with this hotel  The hotel is in a great location and check inout was very quick with great service  The rooms were nice clean quiet and comfortable  The bathrooms were a bit small but split for shower and bath  This was the best hot shower ive ever had outside of my home and the water pressure was just right  Ahhhhhh     overall great hotel and id stay there again 
P => Fantastic rooms  Unique hotel  We were lucky enough to get a room at this hotel through hotwire com and got a great rate  We had a recently refurbished room and it was spacious and clean with great amenities  Huge bathroom  My only gripe is that there is so much going on here  A bar a nightlclub a restaurant and a hotel  It seems a bit confused about what it wants to be  So dont expect to feel special because you are a hotel guest  The check in and check out were ridiculously quick with barely a few words from staff  But the rooms ask for a refurbished one make up for all of that  
P => Great Location Basic Hotel Stayed for three nights at the Hotel De La Montagne  Location is in heart of downtown  Nice roof top barpool  Large room but the carpet needed a good cleaning   weird set up for the bathroom Tub and toilet in one room and the shower and sink in the other  The bed was very firm  Staff was very friendly and helpful  We got a great price on the internet and would recommend staying here if you get a good rate  
P => Stunning large room great location The unique lobby or and accommodating staff set the tone for a great stay at this hotel  The room was spacious and very clean with a huge comfortable bed  Loads of restaurants and shopping close by  
P => Great Hotel The location of hotel is great for visitors   It is close to Metro restaurants shopping and Tourist Information center  The rooms were large and nicely furnished  The beds were very comfortable and covered with nice quality linens  The bathroom was large with two sinks  arate shower and tub  The staff is the best part of hotel  They are helpful and friendly and seem to care whether their guests are happy or not In the summer there is a lot of outside traffic in the lobby and elevators going to the outdoor pool on the top floor  Some look at this as a plus and some might find the extra traffice annoying  The staff always brought hotel guests to front of elevator line and tried to minimize any annoyance to hotel guests I would definitely stay at Hotel de la Montagne again  
P => Great location and interesting space Beautiful and interesting or fabulous beds knock out large washroom  Patio is on th and st floors   amazing views of Montreal at night  Used by not only guests but known as a spot in the city  Weekday staff superior to weekend at front desk all generally pleasant warm and gracious people  Situated near high end shops like Ogilvys and a very short walk to some of the best shopping in Montreal  Close to two Bixi stands at top of street   there is a long protected bike route along De Maisonneuve  There is a wonderful breakfast buffet and I notice it is offered in the sweet deal rate it might be worth it for atmosphere alone but selection and freshness of food coupled with price make it a must  have chocolate croissantPool is small on roof   open to guests solely from     am afterwards patio is open to public  Quite close to Central YMCA no gym in hotel  great magazines guides maps provided by hotel in room and with bellboy  Do not take the hotel for the individual room patios   they are not that nice but it is also something that should not stop you from this wonderful experience  Although no business centre front desk staff were happy to give access to internet  I was in the Contemporary two Queen room as shown on website 
P => Met Expectations Hotel de la Montagne is in a great location near excellent bars restaurants shopping etc  The reception staff were friendly and helpful arranged a couple of nice rooms for us  One of our rooms was reated the other was a bit dated both at least sqm great Valet parking worked well and the Concierge staff were pretty helpful  Its too bad that the tenants of the adjacent buildings complained about the music from Le Magnetique Terrace forcing the hotel to cancel the live musicDJ  
P => OVERALL A NICE HOTEL Lets start with the positives of this hotel  If location is your main goal this hotel is the way to go  It is on the opposite side of Cresent St which is the hub bub of partying  Close to shopping shopping and more shopping  Metro is very close   blocks I believe and no matter which metro stop you get on its easy to transfer to others  Hotel staff was amazingly nice  Held doors each and every time we entered or exited the hotel  When we pulled up to the hotel doorman took our luggage escorted us into lobby and another bellmen took us to our room carrying our luggage  Fast check in  Explained how to get to wherever we wanted to go each and every time  Gave maps and ked areas of interest  Thursdays night club is attached to the hotel right downstairs  Lounge area has a piano player and singer every nite  She sang till    am the one night  Pretty good too  You can even order food from Thrusdays small bar menu and get drinks  The drinks were the strongest and best  Rooms are quite large very good shower pressure large bathrooms comfy beds Now the negatives Pool area is on the roof which when the weather is bad it is not opened and of course two of our days it was closed though I dont think we would have used it anyway  The pool allows anyone to use it it is not exclusive to guest only  There is a bar up there too so not good for a quiet romantic swim or for a family with kids  The view is nice though  Do not eat breakfast at the hotel  Go to eggspectations  Take a left out of the hotel go up the street and there it is on the corner  Great service good food and priced well  We also ate lunch there and husband said his garlic shrimp was the best shrimp he had ever eaten Housekeeping never replaced the sugar my husband used on the first day and was afraid to ask for more as when I called for a bucket of ice they said they would gladly send one up   for  dollars Yikes When I booked the room I did ask for a th floor new room overlooking Cresent st and what I got was an older room th floor overlooking a very loud condenser on a roof  Horrible view  That condenser was so loud had to have the ac on to drown out the loud noise Balcony was small wouldve been doable is there was a chair or two out there  Door for the balcony is in a very akward spot  Curtains dont really cover the window right and light comes peaking in in the early morning hours  Parking is  cdn but paying for parking is the norm up there  Overall I would use the hotel again  The staff is what made the hotel  Dont forget to try steamies  a steamed hot dog a steamed bun loaded with mustard relish onions cabbage and a load of fries  all for  dollars the place we got our was on the corner by club soda Dunns eggspectations  Walk the clock tower to the top  steps see a just for lhs comedy show vist old montreal old notre  dame and if you go in the winter time their water parks become snow parks  So much fun  Wish they did that in the states  
P => Good place to stay if you get a good discount I got a good deal on my stay here knocking about   of the listed pricing  I stayed in the quotcontemporaryquot style room and it was nicely updated with simple tasteful or  On the plus side The bed was very comfortable and the room was a nice size and had good amenities like a big closet mini bar fridge I just used it for the fridge bathroom product assortment hairdryer flat screen TV room controlled thermostat and ample storage for clothing  The staff was very friendly and helpful though one guy steered me off to a restaurant that was horribly overpriced for mediocre food skip the Alexandre on rue Peel  Finally the location is great  Walking distance from two metro stops Peel is closest and Lucien Allier is also nearby great walking on rue St  Catherine and lots of restaurants and shops within blocks  Oh and free wireless in your room BonusOn the negative One of the reasons I chose this place was for the balcony  Ha Hardly  Concrete sunless monstrosity that looked more like a place to dump a body than to sit and enjoy the city  I barely set foot out there  DO NOT choose this place for the balcony  Along the same lines the quotrooftop k and poolquot is certainly just that but it aint anything pretty  These two areas of the hotel make it pretty clear that the place was built in the s as a concrete monstrosity and recent reations have made the rooms quite nice  There is a pool about a x one and there is a sunk around it with about  loungers and a bunch of crowded four tops  Overall the roof felt crowded and sleazy  There were some pretty unsavory guys up there that made me wonder if theyre friends of the workers or what The bottom line Id stay here again because the room is comfortable clean and nicely appointed the location is very convenient and the staff is friendly and helpful  
P => Awesome Hotel at an Awesome Location We stayed  nights at this hotel  th   th and really enjoyed it there   The location is just perfect downtown close to lots of shopping and restaurants  The subway system is a short  block walk   There is an excellent restaurant on the corner  block away calledEggspectations checkitout for breakfast or other meals a wide menus and great food at great prices  Be sure to checkout the POINT ZERO Factory outlet  a block from Eggspectations this store has great prices ask about up to   discounts lots of selection  Ste Catherine street is only  block away  peels sports bar  blocks away  There is a Disco club called Thrusdays attached to the hotel that really gets hopping  We only speak english but found all the Montrealers we met very helpful and they all spoke english to us when they realised we didnt speak french  We will be back to Montreal very soon  GordieHowl 
P => Look no further  My husband and I spent three nights at Hotel de la Montagne and we both anticipate a return in the summer  We were greeted by several of the hotel staff and all had smiles and genuine courtesy  Our room was spacious clean comfortable quiet and well stocked with items such as shoe buffer robes slippers and a well stocked snack and bar  The location is excellent and we are very pleased that we have found this gem  
P => Paris in North America I have stayed at here many times for business and enjoy the feel of the hotel  The staff has always been friendly and courteous  The rooms are clean and very large and the location could not be better for nightlife  In fact I always stay here when I visit Montreal  
P => Overwhelmed WOWThey went above and beyond what most other downtown hotels offer you  I got a very good deal and booked the deluxe  queen w balcony rooms  They gave me the th floor which seems to be the top floor due to the pool being closed until the end of   The rooms were huge They bed was one of the best ive ever slept in  The room was spotless and housekeeping did a very good job  The PM turn down service was a nice touch  The check incheckout was smooth and the concierge was very helpful  The Thursdays bar was overhyped the crowd was alot older than expected but still there is much fun to be had right within  blocks of the hotel  The bartenders there were great  Bathrooms were huge also and had a shower and bathtub  For a fully booked hotel i didnt see many people in it  The lobby is very nice and welcoming  Parking is CAD plus  dollars tax which is very reasonable compared to hotels on the same street charging close to double  Please be aware that they WILL squeeze your luxury car into a overly tight space  The hotel manager is very very helpful  Its the perfect bachelor party hotel with wandas being right on the corner  
P => Room was great  Location awesome  Dug the cheap drinks at Thursdays  The lobby is a little hilarious with the ornate or and big elephant but the contemporary king room was great   exactly like it looks in the picture   and the bathroom was clean and contemporary too  quick check in  nice doorman  and the happy hour until pm at Thursdays featured  for  drinks  the location is great   right in the heart of downtown  If youre looking for a good breakfast head north a block to eggspectations  
P => Hotel de La Montagne was a Good Experience Let me start off by saying that I have very high expectations when I travel which is not always a good thing and Hotel de la Montagne met all my expectations  I booked it through Hotels com and got an exceptionally good price for the Valentines day weekend  The lobby and reception area is fantastic very chic and clean  The reception and staff are extremely helpful and friendly dont know why people here said they are not     The rooms are very spacious but they dont look anything like the rooms on the hotels website so dont be fooled into thinking that thats what youll be getting  We had a balcony but the view was awful  We were in a non smoking room but the corridor often smelled like smoke  Otherwise the hotel is extremely well maintained and there were a lot of little extras in the room to make the stay more comfortable  Washroom is very spacious stand up shower and bath  We also had free internet access  Another plus of course is the location   you are right in the middle of downtown and close to shopping centres In short it was a very pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family 
P => Will definitely be returning      We stayed for  nights and just loved the Crystal De La Montagne  The reception staff and door men were polite and courteous  Reception area fantastic  Lots of roadworks around the traps at the time but I am sure that would be well completed by now  One block away from St Catherine for shopping etc  The hotel consists of both residential and hotel apartments  The rooms are clean and comfortable  Huge bathrooms with a small bedroom Beds are comfortable which was great  Linen was fantastic  Pool was fantastic  The gym was well stocked with the latest equipment  Our highlight would probably be the rooftop jacuzzi which felt pretty amazing once the outside temperature plummeted at night  Our only gripe was that it closed at pm  Im sure that has more to do with the residential apartments and noise restrictions  Will definitely be returning  Pricey but well worth it  
P => Love the Hotel de la Montagne t  My fiancee and I were there in MTL for the st time  Check in was easy with friendly staff  The language barrier wasnt a problem since I kind of know French  Our room was huge with a big bathroom too   I love it  The view was nice too  The location was perfect within half a block of Rue St Catherines and Cresent Street  Plus  blocks away from the Bell Centre   home of the Montreal Canadiens  When checking out our staff was helpful in getting our bags and a taxi  Overall whenever I go back to MTL this hotel will be my st option  
P => Great hotel The hotel is an excellent value  My room was huge had a very comfortable king size bed  I usually have trouble sleeping in a hotel bed but not here  Slept like a baby  Having a balcony was also nice to have just to be able to go out and smoke if needed  Thursdays barnighclub is a fun place to go to meet some people have a drink or two and dance if you feel like it  The service was great too  Whenever I had questions the staff at the front desk answered to the best of their ability and if they didnt know they would find out and let me know asap  The location of the hotel is also great  Right off Rue St  Catharine which is a great street to shop eat and party  It is also close to a few museums  The city is great and this hotel made my stay comfortable and enjoyable  
P => Very Impressed The  things I like the most about this hotel are the rooms and the service  The Room The hotel used to be an apartment building that was converted into a hotel  The result is that the rooms are much larger than you typically find in a hotel  Simply put it is the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in  This is nice when you are visiting for several days and dont want to get that claustrophobic feeling  There is a real sense of space with room to move around  It has a bathroom with a bathtub and a arate room with a vanity and a shower  There is a balcony which allows you to let in fresh air hotels with sealed windows being a pet peeve of mine  The or is very nice with top quality furniture  Nothing was dated or worn  ServiceThe service is beyond what you would normally expect from a mid priced hotel  There is a doorman who is there to take your luggage when you arrive not just to the front desk but to your room after you check in  The gentleman who took mine was very friendly telling me about the area and the hotel amenities on the way to my room  Whenever you enter or leave the hotel there is someone there opening the door for you  The rooms provide thick terry cloth bath robes and every night at about six a lady goes to each room giving out chocolates along with a card showing the weather forecast for the next day  Probably the best service I have ever gotten at a hotel  Location There is no better location from which to spend a few days in downtown Montreal  If you are there for the nightlife the hotel is one street over from the section of Crescent Street where all the nightclubs are located  Close enough to walk in a couple minutes but far enough so that you dont have to deal with the noise when youre in your room  It is half a block from St Catherine Street and about a  minute walk to the subway  The Belle Centre Place Ville ie and the Eaton Centre are all within about a  minute walk  Final thoughts It is the combined effect of all the little things that make this such a nice hotel to stay at  As a frequent traveller I have stayed at many hotels over the years  As a traveller of moderate means they are usually in the mid priced category  I have never stayed at a hotel where they do so much to make you feel pampered and appreciated  Most mid priced hotels feel like mid priced hotels  At Hotel de la Montagne I felt like I was enjoying the benefits of a luxury hotel without the price  For all the travel I have done over the years this is the first hotel Ive stayed where I was so impressed I felt compelled to take the time to write a review  
P => ent hotel great location The hotel has an old world feel about it  Our room was huge and the washroom was also massive with double sinks shower and arate tub  It also had all the amenties  Our room wasnt as fancy as the ones displayed online however it was very nice  They offer  price Happy Hour where you get  drinks for the price of   
P =>   hotel for Grand Prix Week Went to the Montreal Grand Prix and ided to stay at this hotel for the week of the Grand Prix  Was a bit worried given some of the mixed reviews and that the hotel is mainly recommended for singles  However we my husband and me late s had a fantastic time  Crescent Street is the centre of the party from Thurs on and you are right in the middle of it  The hotel has popular bars and night clubs that have huge queues on Thurs   Sat however as a resident you were given immediate access and the staff including bouncersdoormen could not have been nicer  It took mins from our hotel room to get to the Grand Prix circuit which was fantastic the metro is right beside the hotel  Loved everything about it and if you are going to the GP and want to be in the middle of everything her is the place to stay  Dont expect any early nights 
P => Nice hotel but service is really bad Stayed in the hotel for a few days rooms are great big clean  comfy   But service is terrible the doorman never even once opened the door for me no help for the luggage think the fact that i was young    they tought i was going to get any tip  well they didnt as they didnt try  Pool is closed most of the time so Good room but poor service 
P => Nice hotel great location Located in the northwest corner of Centre ville Downtown Montreal the hotel has a great situation   its just a few blocks walk to the Metro the Musee des Beaux Arts and tons of shopping opportunities  Theres a lot of activity within the hotel amp environs too    when I checked in after midnight on a Thursday I could barely hear what Reception was saying over the din in the Cabaret bar and there was a long line of people headed to the Terrace Magnetique bar on the roof  I was pleased upon arrival at my room that I couldnt hear any of it from there actually the simple sounds of a city were more intrusive than the party atmosphere above and below  The halls were a little the worse for wear but the room itself was a good size and very clean and comfortable  Housekeeping did a great job and my interactions with reception were all positive  I couldnt get a feel for the doormans hours almost never seemed to be there  Had room service chocolate mousse was very nice  The restaurant serving breakfast buffet or ala carte and lunch was fine prices reasonable the staff very attentive  My advise for those interested in all the hubbub about the Terrace Magnetique would be to go up and have a drink with friends if you want   its clearly a happening place to be for that purpose   but Please Do Not Eat There Under Any Circumstances  I popped up for a quick lunch one day just to get the atmosphere and the view and the caesar salad with shrimp was simply horrid both to see and taste  I still shudder at the memory  So dont eat there   there are plenty of nice places in walking distance including Cellinis across the street   but for a really pleasant lodging experience The Hotel de la Montagne is a good bet  
P => Fun hotel   excellent for a weekend getaway We stayed at the Montagne for the first time in ember  Staff was professional friendly and helpful  Rooms were large with HUGE bathrooms  Location is great if you are looking for a night on the town but I wouldnt necessarily recommend it for a quiet romantic getaway unless you get an upper floor  I have heard that in the summer it can get pretty noisy Thursdays is a very good place if youre either single or ried uninhibited and you like to make an intimate friend for an interesting evening But packed and frenetic Rooms were spotlessly clean  We didnt call on room service at all so I cant comment on that aspect  
P => First Montreal Stay Arrived in Montreal for the first time and stayed at this hotel for two nights  Doorman was awaiting on arrival and was very helpful and friendly  Walked into the hotel and immediately had a smell        not sure what it was be a little musty or something but was not very attractive  Older looking hotel in the inside  Was checked in fairly quickly  Stayed on the th floor  The room was very large in comparison to any other hotel     Had a very comfortable King Size bed with a large bathroom also with erate tub and walk in shower  Nothing wrong with the room but you definately have to like the style of the hotel  At night they arrived with some chocolates and bottled water  Two for one nights in the bar during happy hour         very good deal indeed  Never ate the hotel as behind it on the street over it is packed with outdoor patios and restaurants        packed  Nothing overly wrong with the hotel but dont think I would choose it again  
P => Perfect Anniversary Getaway My husband and I stayed for  nights including the evening of our anniversary in ch  We arrived a day after the biggest snowstorm of the spring which made trekking around Montreal a challenge The hotel was beautiful and lives up to its impression as older and unique quotboutiquequot accommodations  The location is perfect for a tourist   nestled between Rue Crescent and Rue St  Catharine   the best place to be for shopping and dining Our greeting was perfect the door attendant welcomed us to Montreal and assisted us with parking and our bags  Parking at just   day was a welcome surprise  A much lower rate than most big city downtown hotels we had stayed in  We got a great rate of just   night on expedia for a room with king bed and balcony  The room was clean and lovely cool ble bathroom tiles a tub and shower stocked mini bar and plenty of space to work laptops come with on the trip  Access to wireless internet required a password from the front desk but was complimentary thru our stay The hotel was under some construction during our stay including renos on our floor  The hours of tool usage etc  was more than reasonable and even the contractors were friendly and courteous allowing us to cross their path  We even had a peek at some incomplete hotel rooms which was fun The bar and lounge were welcome retreats  There were nightly piano and singing performances   a perfect end to a long cold day of sight seeing  The fountain of complimentary Clementines was also a treat Just one minor beef we were asked kindly but often by the hotel staff front desk servers door attendant even a housekeeper what brought us to Montreal  We answered each time that it was our first trip to the city and that we were there to celebrate our th Wedding Anniversary  After many congratulations and acknowledgements I was surprised that the hotel made no additional gesture of our very special occasion  Having spent the better part of the last  ades as a hotel employee I know it is both minor and nearly mandatory to send a bottle of wine fruit plate or even just a quick greeting card to any guests celebrating a romantic occasion  It is that little something extra that makes you feel like everyone is listening and really appreciates your choice to stay Regardless   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Montreal  
P => Renos   even the older or is good The hotel is currently undergoing reations  No surprise that the reviews are varied at this time  The building exterior is simple concrete but the hotel entrance and lobby are like stepping into a European boutique hotel where both French amp English are spoken  Some rooms have been updated to the modern sleek look and others are still of the older d cor  All are very clean large with comfortable beds and high end linens including fluffy duvets  Bathrooms are massive with  sinks ent toiletries and arate bath amp shower  Location is ideal valet service is efficient and very friendly  Front desk is professional Dinner at the hotel restaurant   reasonably priced many choices Room service X   delivered fast hot very tasty on tray with cloth napkins water and a flower in vase This hotel has been a long time establishment in a choice location and they provide the special small touches that make a difference  Terry bath robes wine glasses amp cork screw free wireless net an in room powered shoe polisher etc We would love to return after the renos and during warmer weather to experience the rooftop pool amp patio  The weather during our stay was typical winter storm onset   oh well that made the room service that much more appreciated and the Underground City shopping perfect  
P => No reward for loyalty I am dised that I have to write this review about what I previously would have regarded as a top notch hotel  For the last  years my girlfriend and I along with my colleague and his wife ages  have stayed at the Hotel de la Montagne in Montreal Canada for New Years Eve  nights  The fact that we have gone for the last  years speaks to our recognition of the Montagne as a hotel that has a great location convenient bar Thursdays and large rooms  Although the hotel advertises that it is undertaking reations the wear and tear of past years is noticable  The  rooms that we had did not evidence any reations except for the bed which was comfortable  My complaint is lodged in the fact that I have been a loyal guest for  years and have not been rewarded in the least and recently it seems the opposite has occured  The attitudes of the employees were the worst of any prior year  When we asked the concierge for a restaurant recommendation he gave us  names and walked away with no care as to whether they were suitable for what we were looking for  We visited both and were very glad that we did not take the women who had on evening gowns to these pseudo pubs  Sometimes the simple things make the differences  I asked on  arate occassions the front desk for matches as the outside patio area offers large heaters for those still desparate enough to smoke  They not only denied me such a simple accomodation but actually told me on  occasions how the hotel was non smoking and that I was not allowed to smoke in it  Generally I would not take offense to such a comment but given the fact that a patio is available was not very pleased with the unnecessary note especially in light of the fact that the store in the hotel sold ciagarettes cigars and lighters  The hotel store was closed so I asked where the closest location to get matches was and they tried to tell me it was  blocks away  I walked across the street to the Loews Hotel where  doorman greated me with smiles and the hotel front desk provided me with  books of matches  My last complaint about the Montagne is the service  My  room service visits took over  minutes each the bellman was nonexistent and even when we did see him he told us that he couldnt help because he was short staffed  After our dinner on New Years Eve we tried to enter the hotel through the bar and were told to walk around to the front of the hotel dressed in suits and evening gowns during a snow storm  After paying close to night I think I will consider the Ritz and Lowes for my next visit in   
P => couldnt be better you cant find a better place the location is great  we had  rooms  the one side of the hotel looks down at st catherines and the other side looks at rue cresent  from the one side you can see the bell centre  the skyline out your balcony is amazing as you can see in my pic  the rooms are great very nice and clean  very large  the bathrooms are large  rooms come with a safe for no charge a very good size balcony but it has no chairs out there  the room has a stocked bar fridge and a table and chairs  all in all  very nice rooms  the lobby was very beautiful  once u walk in the front door which has a very polite doorman you really see the beauty of this hotel  the check in was okay the checkout wasnt so great  they charged us  dollars for a cot every night and i didnt realize this till i got home  you will see a little lounge on the main floor  that however is not thursdays  we thought it was for the first couple days  we heard so much about thursdays and we were dissapointed    till we found it  walk through the loung on the main floor  down a set of stairs then up a set of stairs  wow this place was hopping they have a huge lounge then a disco down below  this bar is packed with late s and  s people  you want to pick up this is your place  the lounge was rocking but the dico down stairs was really eye opening  im in my late  s had a great time    but i have never seen a place so crazy with people in there s s and s  good time but  plus crowd for sure    the pool wasnt open when we were there as we were there in  but i i read the pool is a happening place  all in all trhis hotel gets a big thumbs up  as for other quick tips about montreal since we were there too party and party only      club  is awesome  pay the extra money get a table and a bottle upstairs in the vip lounge   weather permitting they have a nice outside terrace in the vip area  club laboom was hmmmmmm alright at best     was actually a little dissapointed   very young crowd      get a table in the white room if anything   as for strip clubs chez perez was the best by far once again if your rolling get a table and a bottle of goose it actually is almost cheaper then going up and getting your drinks i think we were paying about  for a bottle of grey goose with red bull and the vip booth   not a bad price at all     and the woman there  aycarumba    very unique crowd there aswell      you see young old ried groups of woman    but everyone that goes to montreal checks out a strip club or  and this is by far the most popular one  as for shopping lots of great shopping  ask around for the entrance to the underground  its a whole shopping mall basically under the city   under st catherines i think  ps   if you like alaskan king crab you have to have it thursdays   bucks but u will be blue in the face by the time you are done eating it   sooo much crab 
P => Loved this hotel We stayed in this hotel for  nights at the beginning of ober  It really does look like it does in the photos  The outside looks slightly rundown its a tall grey building but its completely different once you walk in  The lobby is huge and pretty with a giant chandelier Check in was easy and the staff were really helpful giving us maps and leaflets and advice when we told them it was our first time in Montreal Our room was quite big and had a huge bathroom  The furniture was all in very good condition and the bed was very comfortable  The only bad thing was the balcony it was concrete and shared with the people next door and there were no tables or chairs  The views were good though We ate breakfast at the restaurant a few times it was  I think but you could have as much as you wanted there was lots of fruit croissants and hot food such as eggs and bacon I would definately stay here again if Im in Montreal I didnt want to leave 
P => A Very Good Experience We have stayed in this hotel a few times over the years most recently in ober   Our most recent stay once again met and exceeded expectations  Check in and parking was smooth and the room with king bed was very spacious  We had breakfast included in our weekend package which was very convenient and economical  You just cant beat the quotcharacterquot of this property  You definitely know you are in Montreal and not in some generic chain hotel  We very much enjoy the on site entertainment there is a piano lounge disco and bar which are definitely fun places to visit located right in the hotel  Montrealers know how to party and the bar crowd at the de la Montagne runs from middle aged couples to younger and single  Outside you are adjacent to Crescent Street with lots of restaurants and clubs and St  Catherines Street with tons of shopping  This hotel is in an excellent location After a long day of shopping sightseeing amp eating and drinking the rooms are a welcome sight  Large and clean with very comfortable beds we were satisfied with the lodging quality  Luckily we also got a th floor room with a beautiful view of the skyline  Housekeeping comes by in the early evening with a quottomorrows weatherquot card and chocolates which we thought was a nice touch  Overall for the money we felt this was a good deal and a real find in the city of Montreal  We will continue to visit Montreal for occasional romantic getaway weekends and stay at the Hotel de la Montagne  This city has a lot to offer and the Montagne remains a more than satisfactory part of the experience  
P => More to like than dislike When we arrived at the hotel around  p m  there were  doormen but when we went out to dinner at  p m  they were gone and we never saw them again during our stay  No complaints though   we werent carrying enough luggage to make their services necessary  Check in was a friendly experience and we found the service to be quite good throughout   except when we returned to the hotel around  p m  dressed in our quotcomfort clothesquot sneakers and carrying a Macs bag we got a bit of a look from the front desk as if they thought we were in the wrong place My partner and I had a king deluxe room   very large and spacious and the bathroom was lovely for the most part  One wonders why however when the hotel went to the bother of tiling the floor and walls with ble they would put cheap white tiles in the shower stall and install a pressboard vanity counter  The full length mirror was very nice and we certainly appreciated the  sinks in the bathroom Word to the wise though make sure your room is located on at least the th floor if theyre putting you at the back of the building  We were on the th floor and we could hardly hear ourselves talk over the roar of vents air conditioners etc  while trying to use the balcony  The back of the building overlooks a rather dingy industrial scene and I think being on a higher floor would help  We wondered if because we had booked with Expedia we had been given a quotmoney saversquot room instead of one of their better ones  Or if you dont mind street noise and enjoy people watching ask for a room at the front of the building The mini bar was well stocked the bed was comfortable and the location was excellent  The air conditioner could have worked better and chairs on the balcony would have been helpful but all in all it was a good stay and we will likely return  
P => Loved this hotel I stayed at this hotel in t  We went to see Genesis play  This hotel is in a central downtown location  It was  blocks from the metro and right around the courner from St cathrine street  The rooms were large  The beds were very comfortable  Simmions beautyrest pillowtop mattresses  They also had fluffy pillows  The bathroom was huge  It had a shower and erate tub  i also liked that there was a balcony  There were a couple of bars resterants in the hotel  This was nice not having to leave the hotel if you didnt want to  There was a breakfast buffet that was included in our room  This wasnt your typical continential breakfast  The had crossants danishes lots of fresh fruit and yogart scrambaled eggs bacon sausage homefrys and pancakes  It was very good  The under ground garage parking was also nice  this included valet parking  Nice added touch  We would stay there again 
P => Nice place to stay     but dont expect to use the pool My wife and I ided to visit Montr al this summer with our children  I have always stayed downtown at other business hotels butthis time I was looking for something with a bit more  character  that the children might appreciate I did a fair bit of research on the internet and ided on l H tel de la Montagne  Definitely one of the most attractive features of thehotel was the rooftop pool which is a must when travelling with children  It seems now that I didnt do enough research based on our experience this past week The hotel is nicely situated in the best part of downtown Montreal and the hotel is very comfortable and their staff was very friendly and well mannered  The facilities are very well appointed and our standard room was quite large   this is one of the very few downtown hotels that offer queen sized beds  But I certainly had quite a bit of concern with their swimming pool Their website provides an image of a quiet and relaxed pool setting that describes the scene as a  hidden oasis high above the city   a dream spot in the heart of downtown for sunbathing around the pool having a drink and a light meal   Their video reinforces this concept with a woman diving into a calm clear pool as a few other guests serenely watch from the terrace In reality we found a much different scene when we arrived at the pool at  P M  after a sun filled morning of touring the city and looking for some quiet relaxation and cool down  What we found was quite simply shocking  The pool k was crowded almost beyond capacity and not a single chair was available to us  The vast majority of this  clientele  were quite obviously not guests of the hotel  Most were early twenty somethings wearing skimpy bathing suits and covered in tattoos  It was as if we had walked into a scenefrom a spring break party at Fort Lauderdale We were not alone in our reaction   another young family with a baby arrived shortly afterus with a look that showed that they were even more taken aback than we were  From the brief conversation we had with them we learned thatthey were under the same false impression as we had about the access and use of the pool   that being for hotel guests only  It is definitely not  Anyone who buys a drink is welcome and seems to have priority over hotel guests The crowd was quite obviously uninterested in using the pool for swimming  Apart from the full k there was an equally large numberof people seated around andor standing in the water around the edge the edge of the pool  Practically everyone had a beer or cocktail glass definitely a safety issue around a pool I might add and a fair number were smoking cigarettes some even while they were in the pool  For a young family this was quite shocking and quite unacceptable  It was quite obvious that this  clientele  were not guests of the hotel  I counted only five  people on the pool k that I could assume were guests given that they had hotel towels with them sincenone were being provided to guests   despite the contrary statement on their website  We were not the only guests obviously frustrated by the experience  One poor man was trying to do laps but was havinga very difficult time  navigating  amongst the partiers and gave up after only a few ends  Another woman was trying to find some sun and a place to read her book but after being bumped and crawled over by the crowd one too many times she too gave up and left For our part my two dhters aged  wanted to cool off a bit so we  coaxed  an opening onto the shallow end wall to allow them accessto the pool  Being children they splashed a bit as they tried to swim in the open area of the shallow end  This was obviously not appreciated by the people standing around the edge of the pool who were trying to maintain their hair makeup and bikinis in pristine condition as well as find the chance to pickup a date for the evening  After a few minutes we also simply gave up and left the pool area completely quite disappointed and frustrated This would be a great hotel for singles and young rieds without kids who dont mind serious crowds and want the quoteye candyquot but certainly not a place for the rest of us A definite disappointment for us and we will not be returning anytimesoon  
P => Clean HUGE rooms  Good location  Headed up to Montreal for  nights to attend the Just for Lhs Festival OComics amp Spymonkey  HILARIOUS and one of the entries in the annual International Fireworks Competition absolutely stunning We chose the Hotel de la Montagne for its location and price  We werehappy with our choice  The room a standard king was HUGE  arate shower and tub in ble bathroom comfy bed     The furnishings were not shinysleekmodern but everything was in good shape and overall we felt very at home there The concierge was helpful and also let us know for next time that he often has discount tickets available for shows around town Our only complaint was with the rooftop poolbar  The pool is open tothe public and they certainly take advantage  We went up at about PM hoping to take a quick dip and sun ourselves only to find a space PACKED with young people  Great if you are single and interested in partying and drinking with beautiful people  Not so great if youre looking for a quiet hour in the sun with a fruity drink and a book  There wasnt an available chair to be seen in the small pool area  I wish that they would perhaps institute a quothotel guests onlyquot period for a few hours every day since we would have liked to relax there for a while  The arate bar and terrasse are very nice for an outdoor drink and some light food Every room has a balcony which offers great nighttime views of the city  but our one question why dont they put chairs out there for the guests A lil odd As for location the hotel is one block from Crescent  bars and restaurants one block from St  Catherine  shopping GALORE go to Simons for affordable and cute Quebec made clothes four blocks or so from the nearest Metro two blocks or so from the Bell Center  Convenient enough spot for all your tourist needs We were on the th floor overlooking Crescent so we werent subjected to either the street noise or the rooftop noise that some reviewers commented on I would certainly return to the Hotel de la Montagne for my next trip    Word to the wise    Do NOT take LAerobus airport shuttle back to the airport  We got on the shuttle at  for a PM flight  We informed them more than once what time our flight was  Our driver wasdismissive quotYeah yeah itll be fine quot She proceeded to drive down streets that even we as tourists knew were closed off  She made several stops and didnt even pick up any additional passengers  Because of LAerobus inefficient and unreliable driver we missed our flight and had to pay  each to get our tickets reissued  Even the ticket agent at Air Canada agreed that theyre uselessThe service is fine FROM the airport to your hotel but do yourself a favor and pay the  to get a taxi when youre heading home 
P => Very disappointed I stayed here between   and     The hotel is located near Crescent Street a large street party area  Music and singing blasted all night long as a festival was in progress from Friday Monday  About  a m  the music and party goers departed  The street noise was incredible and to make matters worse the TV had a volume control that you could barely here above the street din  There is no coffee maker in this  star rated hotel  The ac unit was barely functional and the thick bedding was designed for the harsh Montreal winters  If you plan on visiting during the summer months when the jazz festivals and other outdoor events are planned do not stay anywhere near Crescent Street  
P => Straight DOPE Over Memorial Day weekend ten friends and myself stayed at this hotel and it was totally RAD People say that it is dated so what so is your girlfriend  The pool on the roof is as cool as it gets  We arrived on Friday afternoon and the roof looked like a scene from springbreak in Cancun  So the pool and roof top bar are tight  The restaurant is killer  The club in the basement is what it is a club in the basement of a hotel  How much can you expect But if you are down thier on a Sunday night the ladies are fine  The location is top notch in the middle of everything you need  The staff was awesome they ask no questions and answer all of them  We were here for a bachelor party and were very loud and crazy and no one ever beefed on us  I reccomend this place for anyone serious about getn down  
P => This Hotel is perfect for a stay in Montreal We really had a terrific stay here  I knew we had gotten a good deal when we booked through Expedia but I was somewhat concerned when I read from some reviewers that the hotel was getting a little run down  All I can say is  NOT true at least not any of it that my wife and I saw  From the lobby to the restaurants and especially the rooms All up to date clean modern and well orated  The rooms are huge and the beds we had a king room are very comfortable  The rooms all have a balcony  Ours off the back looked out over Rue Crescent one of the busiest areas for nightlife in the city  This hotel IS the center of Montreal and Club Thursdays seems to be the busiest club in the city  The bar and disco are packed from Thursday to Saturday nights Amazingly Thursday seemed the busiest  Happy hours duting the week go from     PM and the bars are jumping  Good music BIG drinks great people  We found the people of Montreal extremely friendly and the hotel staff were anxious to help in any way  Id give this place  stars in all categories and highly recommend it  Make sure to try Le Beaue Jolies sp restaurant upstairs from Club Thursdays and get the buffet breakfast in the upstairs lobbyrestaurant   both excellent  Thats the best part of this hotel   you really dont need to leave it but you should  Montreal is a great city and theres tons of things to do and see weather permitting and we got lucky with an early spring heat wave the  days we were there  
P => Would definitely stay here again First of all this hotel is in a great location in the Centre Ville section of Montreal  There are many restaurants and bars very nearbyas well as good shopping according to my wife  The guest rooms at the Hotel are very large as is the bathroom which had a double vanity and arate shower stall and bathtub  The bed was incredibly comfortable too The staff at the Hotel were all very nice and accommodating  You can convert currency right at the front desk and the concierge went out of his way to make restaurant suggestions and highlight some areas we  want to see as first time visitors to Montreal  All in all I rate the Hotel de la Montagne an quotExcellentquot  
P => Wonderful Experience Great downtown location  We valet parked the car undergound day and walked   Only about  blocks to the Eaton Centre and  block to St  Catherines St  It was good and cold so there was no strolling around An old style grand hotel with very large rooms which were nicely orated  Huge bathroom  The ecclectic lobby was cozy with big leather couches and chairs  Ideal for reading the paper and watching the world go by The staff everybody was VERY freindly and all switched between French and English effortlessly Happy hour in the lobby caberet during the week was really happy  Order one drink and they deliver two  It also had low key entertainment on Friday and Saturday Buffet breakfast was wonderful and there is a great restuaruant and bar in the same building but through a short tunnel  It was a very quick walk to many other dining experiences  The Interent access is wireless and free Only negatives were that you could only get ice through room service and there was no place to eat between breakfast and dinner without going out  No big deal We were there    and paid  CDNtaxes per night  Wow winter rates     I dont knowGreat experience  We would go again    in fact we will  
P => The Best Kept Secret in North Ameriica  Montreal Hotel De La MontagneDate uary Reviewer Aerospace SalesmanI have been coming to the Hotel De la Montagne for over  years at least once a month  I recently read a review by another hotel guest and felt that eventhough they have a right to their opinion their criticism of finding and  Empty quot condom wrapper near the bed after the turn down process offended them  I can only wonder if what they found was a candy wrapper which is by the way provided to you each evening with the turn down service would they have the same thoughts I started my aerospace traveling y rd  and have traveled the world and can honestly say I look forward to arriving back at the Hotel De La Montagne each and every time  You could not feel any more welcome or comfortable in your own home  The staff and Hotel surroundings are Magnificent Tina Rodriguez and her staff have always handled any issue professionally with a courteous attitude Do your self a favor visit this hotel and see how you should be treated in a st class hotels 
P => Pretty hotel great location but a really bad experience    Hi there we stayed at the hotel de la Montagne last night in room   For some background we have stayed at this hotel once before and liked it so much we went back  Regularly   night we booked it on expedia ca at   per night It is a small and pretty hotel full of character in a great location and close to the Bell Centre where we had tickets to a show  This was part of the reason we selected De la Montagne again  We had no trouble with valet parking   overnight or check in  All were done quickly and politely in English or French everyone we interacted with at the hotel was bilingual  The breakfast buffet was excellent   per person and well presented   fresh fruit pastries croissants cut fruit melons strawberries peaches etc  and cottage cheese  On the hot food side you had pancakes hash browns bacon sausage or ham and they also served scrambled eggs  They have a full range of dry cereal juices and coffee too  You had a selection of English or French newspapers to read over breakfast  The service we received was good and courteous  Our RoomWe had a Queen room which appeared to be clean and well appointed  ble floors in the bathroom robes slippers as well as all the little toiletries  The main room was pretty with a large closet drawers and safe  It also boasts a mini fridge stocked with everything you could need when in the mood for a snack or drink all  extra  The room had a nice firm bed fluffy duvet and pillows  At night the hotel offers turn down service complete with little chocolates and the next days weather forecast  For those who like room the King rooms are much larger we had a king room on our prior visit in tember   Background of our complaint and why I give the Hotel De la Montage a poor rating We checked in dropped our stuff in the room and literally went straight to the show at the nearby Bell Centre  We returned just after the concert ended at pm and prepared for bed  Turn down service was provided some time while we were out at the concert  Much to my dis upon sitting on the edge of the bed we noticed an open amp empty condom wrapper on the floor  Something neither my husband nor I noticed when we entered the room earlier in the evening  We immediately called the front desk to mention it  We were told to take up our complaint with the day manager Ms  Rodriguez in the morning when we checked out  We were told she would be there as of am and that our message would be relayed to her When we checked out at approximately am we spoke with Ms  Rodriguez  She mentioned she had not received our message and that she had just arrived  I explained the thought of the hotel providing a turn down service in a lovely hotel and then the eerie coincidence of the condom wrapper on the floor was sickening  She said it was not acceptable but offered nothing to remedy the situation  No more than an quotIm sorry I will look into it quot And interesting that she asked where the wrapper was at that moment   almost as if to imply we were making it up  So much for treating the customer as we expect to be treated  We were not looking for a free nights stay or anything of that nature but something was due given the situation  Show a client some empathy   pay for our parking offer a discount on our next stay SOMETHING Oversightaccident or not this is unacceptable at a hotel of this level  We will no longer stay at this hotel as a direct result of this experience  We will try the Vogue directly across the street the next time  The reason we liked this hotel and went back was its great location to all things   you are right downtown three blocks to the Bell Centre home of the Montreal Canadiens shopping one block over on St Catherine St  or the Louis Vuitton shop in Ogilvys in the same block  I suggest using your judgement no question it is a lovely looking hotel  This was most likely an isolated thing but how the hotel handled it was what you  want to think about before booking your stay  If you have a problem it  not be addressed to your satisfaction if even at all  Best wishes happy travels 
P => Comfort in the best location in the city I have stayed here  times on business now and the proximity to everything is the best thing about this hotel  You know Location Location Location It backs onto Crescent Street which is a fantastic barrestaurant strip tourist central is walking distance from the downtown core and is half a block north of the best shopping district The hotel as stated by others is not over the top luxurious but is pleasant and the staff is always polite  They have a great happy hour every night to being people together in the lobby bar and the food in the nd floor restaurant is good too If you are looking for a fantastic restaurant experience with amazing food and great wine pairings try the Cafe Europa about  yards down the street  Its not cheap but it is a top notch dining experience  
P => Not exceptional   but definitely an above average experience Just returned from spending  nights at the De La Montagne one of them New Years Eve  We stayed in a King Suite which was very spacious  Furnituredrapescarpet looked somewhat dated but the bed was very comfortable and the washroom was clean and big  Didnt really notice the smell of cigarette smoke as other travellers reported  Private balcony overlooking the city was nice  Doorman amp bellboy were great front desk staff were efficient but not overly friendly  Hotel is centrally located and close to restaurants the subway musuems Bell Centre and shopping note that Ste Catherine Street is a popular area so you are going to get a wide variety of characters hanging out but it is much safer than most other N A  cities   as well as the nightlife especially the night life  If you like action then their bar Thursdays is among many late night spots on Crescent St    Basically the De La Montagne is a different experience and its pluses far outweigh any minuses  Its the perfect spot for a few days if your interests are shopping amp sightseeing during the day and wining amp dining until the wee hours of the morning  
P => Perfect for me I have long been of the opinion that no hotel bed is ever comfortable regardles of how highly rated or how high priced the hotel  The Hotel de la Montagne destroyed that myth  My deluxe room was spacious clean and well and beautifully appointed  I thoroughly enjoyed the music and the food in the piano bar found the walking distance access to the museum an unexpected treat and was pleasantly surprised at how well the air conditioning controlled the cigarette smoke  The staff were delightful  I only regretted that I had such a short visit  
P => This place is a dump If you enjoy cheesy loud music in a run down lobby and carpeting in the rooms that are stained with god only knows then this is the perfect place for you  For everyone else I suggest spending the extra  on a real hotel room  Also dont be fooled by the roof top pool  It too is a dump that gets extremely crowded with a bunch of idiots  Though I must say if you get thirsty while at the pool you can enjoy a drink from the poolside bar  Just be sure to leave a tip so you dont get yelled at by the bartender like i did  
P => Loved this hotel We booked this hotel on line and found a great price  This hotel is centrally located and we could walk to all tours and restaurants  The rooms were fantastic and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful I would definitely recommend this hotel  expecially for a price under    
P => Quite Enjoyable ided to have a weekend getaway in Montreal and stayed here  Upon arrival doorman and staff and bell boy were extremely courteous  Has an old world charm  Even a balcony  Lovely wood furniture and comfortable King bed with turn down service  Nice big washroom and even terrycloth bath robes Lots of bars if you like to socialize  Thursdays has a great happy hour Monday to Friday  Very happening place  Location was great  We walked to old Montreal to St  Catherines shopping and Bell Canada Ctr for a hockey game  Great restaurant district nearby  Reubens has an amazing Reuben sandwich   dollar cab ride to Via Station  Had a great weekend will probably stay here again  First class  
P => Loved Hotel de la Montagne We arrived in Montreal at Hotel de la Montagne on t  and stayed until t    We were extremely happy with our stay here  The rooms were very large very clean and had a balcony to walk out to  The bathroom was very very large a double vanity arate tub and arate shower  Nice and clean all ble  They turned down your bed at night and left chocolates with next days forecast  The hotel room was done in an older style but in perfect condition  This hotel has class Its worth its   star rating  Worth every penney of our expedia low rate of    Parking is   canadian per night with inout privileges which is average for Montreal abd Toronto The desk personnel and concierge were helpful and friendly  My only slight if any negative was a slight smokey smell objectionable to probably just me in the Hotel lobby  I believe it was this way because of the open Cabaret adjacent to the lobby The Hotel is located in a nice part of Downtown Montreal near all kinds of shops and boutiques on Blvd Rene Levesque  It is located one street from Blvd Maisoneuvve and one block from Crescent street with lots of restaurants and nightclubs This is truly a hidden gem in Montreal for the price  Worth every penny  
P => What a delightful surprise Just came back from an extended Labour Day weekend at the Hotel de la Montagne  It was one of the nicest rooms Ive stayed in roomy extremely comfortable beds huge bathroom  The beds were turned down each night with chocolates and the next days weather forecast left for us  The hotel is right in the heart of the shoppingrestaurant area so it was extremely convenient  Friendly helpful desk staff  Loved the restaurant where we had breakfast most days    the staff there were charming and the pain chocolat to die for This was my first trip to Montreal but I enjoyed it immensely  You dont even have to leave the hotel for entertainment with its many bars and restaurants We asked for a room quotin the middlequot so werent very bothered by the rooftop club  Took a day trip to Quebec City by bus purchased at the hotel which was also lovely  
P => Would return to this hotel We spent one evening at Hotel de la Montagne and enjoyed it thoroughly  I chose the hotel because of the price  Cdn and the excellent location  The lobby looks a little older but is orated with a real European flair  The room was clean and enormous with one of the biggest bathrooms I have ever seen in a hotel of this price range double sinks arate shower and bathtub heat lamp phone  We had a king size bed the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel with a feather duvet dresser desk and armoire with tv and mini bar  There was also a balcony  The location is ideal steps from the shopping of St  Catharine Street and right next to Crescent Street which has lots of bars and restaurants to choose from  Overall I was impressed with this hotel and would stay there again  
P => The Glory days of this hotel are OVER For some background the reader needs to know that my wife and I spent the second night of our honeymoon at this hotel back in ust of   It was the first time we had ever been to the hotel or to Montreal and it was a velous experience  So we were eagerly looking forward to seeing the place again to celebrate our th wedding anniversary Sadly the Hotel de la Montagne has lost its lustre and charm over the years  Here is my analysisFirst the room itself was very nice and the housekeepers and maid service people did an excellent job of cleaning the room Second the previous reviews that speak of the Hotel lobby being run down or whatever are not true  The lobby looked as attractive and enchanting as it did back in   Third the overall experience was not very good  We got to the hotel at pm  Check in time was pm  Our room was still not ready Another bad sign was that guests have to pay for Internet service through a third party provider  In my case I paid and after a few hours the service quit working I called the front desk and they said I had to call a toll free number which would cost me   I protested and the clerk assured me that he would credit the  back to my bill  He did NOT do it Fourth and worst of all I had called the hotel three times prior to my arrival about specifically wanting a room in a QUIET part of the hotel  Didnt happen  We were there Sunday through Tuesday nights and on Sunday and Monday nights music from somewhere outside our room on the th floor was so loud it awakened us  At it didnt stop until after AM Finally potential clients should know that the neighborhood where the hotel is located has lined in the  years since we last stayed there There is a large porno palace strip joint just up the street from the hotel and the immediate shopping area was crawling with various shades of sub humanity along with larger numbers of fairly harmless looking normal people There were several other things but this should serve as a forewarning to all who  think of staying there  If you want my advice try the Hotel Delta  
P => Great stay Great people Old Montreal was lovely I stayed here in e  for  nites  The price was less than   american dollars and I had a KING SUITE TO BOOT Beautiful room clean and with all the amenities including snuggly robe and slippers  The hotel featured a beautiful lobby with enormous crystal lighting and a fountain   too pretty to describe you have to see for yourself  The hotel personnel were wonderful as well  I went solo on this trip to Montreal and had a wonderful time  See this beautiful friendly and clean city if you get a chance The hotel was within walking distance to the subway system which is awesome in itself  Very clean and the service people were so helpful  Also walking distance to great shopping and restaurants  Bonjour  I booked the hotel on Expedia  
P => tired lobby terrific rooms after reading recent reviews of this hotel i was very apprehensive about staying there  but since we had pre paid and gotten a great rate on line  we forged ahead  we were VERY happy with our choice  the lobby is tired and dated and doesnt make a very good first impression  the halls to the guest rooms are narrow and dark but when we opened the door to our room all our misgivings vanished  the room was among the largest i have ever stayed in and had big double dresser big tv in room safe terrycloth robes complimentary slippers shoe shine machine suit pressing machine plenty of seating space very big closet and a king sized bed  the bathroom was even better all black and white ble and tile two sinks how often does that happen and a shower AND a tub lots of mirrors a hair dryer a scale and a lot of space  so i would rate the rooms way above average i did ask for a room on a lower floor so as not to hear the noise from the rooftop bar disco  the pool was wall to wall people on the weekend but we didnt go to montreal to use the pool  both the lobby bar and the rooftop bar were extremely crowded with young people so much that there was a line to use the elevators  but the hotel had staff there to make sure hotel guests went to the front of the line  most of the crowds there looked fine but a few guys looked rough  we were on the th floor and never heard a sound from our room the staff was most helpful with restaurant reservations suggestions directions etc  i accidentally left a purchase in my room when we checked out and i called today and they had it and are sending it to me usually if you leave something behind its never found so i am very happy with the honesty of the staff  everyone there was very friendly and the location of the hotel is wonderful it was well worth the money and yes we would stay there again  hope other readers will not be put off by the negative reviews posted here  we were very happy with the entire experience  
P => Met all expectations and more Just returned from our first weekend to Montreal and was stunned to see the poor experiences people had at this hotel the same time we were there We found the staff very helpful and had a concierge bring us to our room with a terrace and a nice view of Crescent Street  We were one floor under the roof pool and he admitted upon check in that we might hear the music  Since we stay up late things close at  a m  on weekends I didnt think I would be bothered and I wasnt  With the air conditioning you couldnt hear much though you could feel the bass beats in the bathroom Room was exceptional  Huge with seating area the terrace and a big clean bathroom  Chocolate on the pillows every day  For less than  a night American I dont know how anyone could expect better Did not go to any of the places on site  The bar looked cool during the day but as with the rest of Crescent Street became very young and trendy on the weekend nights  We found the Claddagh Pub next door a little more our speed we are both in our early s  The pasta place across the street is very good but stay far away from Dundees  ent beer selection but their food is cafeteria fare at premium prices with a wait staff who could care less  I dont think our girl even had a pulse In the area Great Eggspectations is a great deal on the next block and Le Cafe Paris is a nice place for coffee  There are also two nicer souvenir stores two blocks north on Ste  Catherine on the left The Old Port is the classier quieter more expensive part of town  It is about a two mile walk right down Ste  Catherine  It takes about a half hour so it depends on your lifestyle whether you think that is too far or not  A cab down there is about  bucks CAD at night including tip  If you go down there Jardin Nelson is a nice open air place with music and reasonably priced food Things are expensive in Montreal  Think NYC prices  A beer is  bucks including tax  Sure the American dollar is worth more but the  percent tax makes up for it  Tax is on clothing and food too unlike some American states I would say this hotel is most ideal for a younger crowd  It is probably not a good family spot and it could be loud  Also keep in mind that Montreal does not have the same taboos as Americans regarding sex and drugs so there are references and photos everywhere  If you are very sensitive about your kids seeing such things then consider another city or at the very least constrict your stay to the touristy Old Port But for  something and  something tourists it was just about perfect  Plan to stay there again when we come back  
P => Okay not great We arrived about  p m  went to our room which was not made up The previous guests left a quotplease clean this roomquot sign on the door and the maids thought it said quotdo not disturbquot so we walked into a dirty room  Yuk  They fixed it right away The desk clerk was snotty but everyone else was helpful and nice The location is good right above St  Catherine street with lots of shops and restaurants The rooms are large but somewhat dark and dirty The nightclub is noisy you can hear the bass quotboom boom boomquot from the disco and we were on the th floor  Also someone left their keys in the lobby so the hotel staff woke us up at  a m  to see if they were our keysIf you like to party with young people I guess this is the hotel  
P => Anti American Dirty  The service was HORRIBLE  I came here determined to ignore it completely intending only to work  But it has been so horrible I cant overlook it  This  have something to do with the fact that I visibly tipped using American money  And having been raised here I know that a Quebecer can spot an american bill from  yards away   sniper esque  The locals are racist   an unfortunate term we use to describe the hatred of a people based on place of residence and not race  In any case they must hate Americans here even though they love their money  The barmaid at the pool eth  at about pm spoke to me in French after I addressed her in English  How rude  Then she yelled at me So I was ignored by the waitresses who didnt ignore any of the men and yelled at by the barmaid in my first minute here  I asked her whether it was possible to get a chair placed in the sun given that all the free chairs were secured by lock and chain  She yelled at me to inform me that she was too busy to help me  Then when I told her I wasntasking HER to do it but only needed information she said quotrelaxquot I wasnt yelling  i know that because I dont yell  Then someone sitting at the bar told me in English that the lifeguard would help me  That man at the bar  have been the only English person there  The place is full of locals as the pool is open to the public A dirty ashtray was left by my feet at the poolside by the same young man who informed me that I could get free internet here if I invested in a wireless card  I was embarassed for him  The place was a dirty circus and I felt cheated and scammed for having spent all that money there just trying to buy a relaxing day by a pool in the sun    for parking   per drink only  and a half of which I was able to drink  With tip   per drink    USD tip for the lifeguard  Thats over   for my dignity which felt lowered by my mere presence here  What a waste of  precious hours  Then I found out I was scammed for parking having paid more than what I was supposed to pay  I was too upset to notice as the visit ruined my entire day On the inside I stayed there  weeks ago while ata conference along with several Americans  The room was mediocre and smelled like mold and the service was worse  The men in our party were treated better than the women  I suppose they assume the women there are not paying customers  The reason for this is that at night you will find prostitutes there  If you dont believe me ask anyone at quotThursdaysquot a bar a block away  
P => good rate but     The staff is nice and helpful  The rate is good  The hotel is in a great location  Overall we had a good time  However it is NOT a four star hotel  It is not even a three star hotel  The lobby is depressingly tired with rancid cigar smoke lingering in the air day and night  The rooms are very large  But the furniture is a cheap use of wannabe materials  Ex  instead of ble in the bathroom its plastic that looks like ble  The brunch is good  However it used to be great  Parking is  day  There is a club that has very loud music until  am  So stay on the street side of the building  The room rate and location made it a good deal for us  
P => Se Magnifique  
P => You can trust my reveiw  
P => I would go back for sure  
P => After  years of staying at Montagne wont return  
P => Hotel with personality  
P => Beautiful elegant European like affair  
P => Had a great weekend at the Hotel De la Montagne  
P => Wonderful time  
P => Chic and modern room  
P => Tr s bon hotel

P => Quirky Montreal hotel Perhaps not the obvious choice for a Montreal hotel but it actually proved a perfect base for a brief stay in the city  It doesnt look like a hotel from the outside though the guide book which called it the ugliest building in town was way off the k  In fact it looks like a trendy office block on the outside and its receptionfoyer area wouldnt be out of place in a trendy ad agency  The few staff are incrediby young and incredibly attentive preumably most are students at the Institute  The room was well equipped and all have small balconies with good views over the city  The bathrooms are admittedly quite small but perfectly adequate  A good buffet breakfast including waitress delivered hot food was included  Although not downtown its located in one of the tendiest areas of the city close to countless great bars and restaurants  
P => Good location and good restaurant We were on a road trip through Quebec and were recommended this hotel on short notice  You can walk into town in about  minutes  Subway nearby  The rooms are modern with secure locks and balconies some with fair views  The hallways are wide enough you could drive a car down them  There is active securtiy personnel monitoring a very long lobby that connects the hotel to a restaurant on the ground floor  You can park your car in a garage with an automatic door that has elevator access to your rooms floor   it was not cheap parking cost about day but I thought worth it for our peace of mind the first time in this city  The beds were comfortable and the bath roomy clean and modern  We were very happy with this choice The hotel is a school and run by students and I think they do a very good job  The attached restaurant is also a school and that was the most pleasant surprise  They have a daily menu for dinner that was for us a six course meal for what we considered an absolute bargain  Even if you dont stay here you should check out the restaurant  The atmosphere is a bit cool almost as if youre in a cafeteria or conference center but the food and service are excellent  Its in a mixed use neighborhood with shops office buildings apartment buildings and restaurants a little gritty in some corners but overall quite acceptable  We walked downtown to see some of the artists during the Jazz Festival but there is a subway stop right nearby as well so you can around the whole city easily  We found this to be an excellent overall value in a good location and one of the highlights of our trip  We would recommend it highly to anyone  
P => Very nice stay in the Institute Just two blocks off of the Quartier Latin located it is very close to the action yet far enough to get a good nights sleep  I loved the modern interior  The very clean room was in the top floor facing north  Very good  queen size beds  The breakfeast in the morning was great and included  Parking is pretty steep  per day plus the  for the double bed  room is also not the cheapest  The staff was very helpful and friendly  
P => Great place great location Stayed here for  nights in mid tember  Its staffed by students with some professional non student staff as well  Great service everyone very helpful and pleasant  Good room great bed but very hard pillows  The rooms have small balconies ours had a view of Mont Royal itself  I think some rooms are handicapped accessible  Parking is available for CDday charged to your room breakfast is included in the restaurant downstairs  Very slow breakfast service Thats my only complaint  Husband loved it  Great location close to everything a subway stop right behind the hotel  Give it a try  
P => Great place great location My wife and I have gone to lInstitut for many years before recent remodeling  A very very ent hotel and manageable proportions   really excellent sit down breakfast   and a great location in the French district with lots of young vibrant people about  Very close to METRO and all the transit links  Well go again  
P => Quelle salle de bain  
P => 
P => Terrible place The room was very dirty  There was dust on the window sill fan and bedside table  There was also a large spider web in one corner with a large spider crawling on it  There were several walls that had holes in them and finally there was no TV or phone  
P => Over priced and dirty Like others I was pleased with the exterior and location of the Hotel de Paris but very dissapointed with the room itself  It was cramped and dirty we actually had a plane of sheet glass sitting behind one of the curtains in our room leaning against the TV cabinet  We cycled into Montreal and stayed here based on the fact that it had the Route Verte certification but were very dissapointed with the bicycle parking amenities we were told to bring our tandem bike up two flights of stairs to place in our room  
P => Good location but disappointing overall and definitely over priced First thing I should mention is that we stayed in the annex across across the road from the main hotel quotRun downquot would be the expression that would most accurately describe the place  Either that or quotdone on the cheapquot  The towels were thin and small and they were replaced on a seemingly random basis  The building itself could have been doing with a lick of paint and the exterior garden was overgrown and shabby  Little things that are easly fixed but make a big impression   clearly the owners do not see this as a priority For example the cleanliness left a lot to be desired dusty shelf floor could have been swept with a bit more effort and the shower cubicle was tiny was really hard to move around in   lets just say if you were even slightly obese you would have a job even getting into it  There was a stained old rug on the floor which I made a point of avoiding when walking barefoot The window shutters were cumbersome and the AC unit was completely and utterly useless   it clearly hadnt been cleaned in eons and therefore served no purpose other than to sound like a jumbo jet taking off Breakfast isnt worth mentioning   go to Coras and enjoy a proper mealPLUS Good location MINUS No working AC facility despite being listed as such  
P => Nice place near McGill I enjoyed this small hotel which is in a very good location I was able to walk everywhere I wanted togo  I took the suite  It had a balcony overlooking the old city  My twin dhters who will attend McGill next year stayed in a budget room  The staff were helpful and prices were very reasonable for downtown  
P => Great little boutique type hotel We stayed at Hotel de Paris on the long  weekend  We had a very cute room on the second floor of the hotel with a queen bed at a very reasonable price  The room was spotless and the staff friendly  It is a smaller hotel not a chain and thats what I liked about it it has tons of character and is just a pleasant relaxing place to be  Great location near a ton of restaurants and the metro  Highly recommended  
P => Clean and affordable This hotel was great many many many stairs Clean rooms we stayed in a budget two star and it was small however the bathroom was completely new and the sheets were clean  front desk is very kind and helpful  Excellent location if you want to walk to the village or latin quarter  And Rue st catherine is about a  dollar cab ride  Breakfast was modest but just enough to get you started in the morning choice of fresh muffin or croissent with teacoffee and a small cup of juice  Could not ask for more at  dollars a night  Honestly if your going to drink or shop and dont plan on using your room for anything other than a place to sleep  Hotel de Paris is a great bang for your buck 
P => It is a great pace to stay I came with  other friends on a cross country trip and they set us up in the Hostel area  The staff were really nice and were able to give us great advice on activities  We also made friends with another group of young people in the lounge and ended up going on excursions together we had a blast 
P => Cute little hotel I enjoyed my stay at Hotel de Paris  I was on business in Montreal and loved the location close enough to walk to all my meetings downtown and some great restaurants  The room was clean quiet comfortable and had free WIFI and a small desk to complete all my work  The hotel has character and friendly staff  Definitely a more enjoyable experience than another Holiday Inn  I would definitely go back especially for the price  
P => Good Solid Accomadations  I stayed at the hotel for the Easter long weekend  The location was excellent and the room was on the rd floor  It was clean cozy and quiet  Very nice accomadations especially for a standard room  The manager at the front desk was extremely helpful and gave me great directions to get around the city  Great experince at a very affordable price  
P => great value great place for young people Enjoyed my stay here  I took a budget room for  canadian dollars with my girlfriend  It was small but clean  This turned out to be   US a great deal for downtown montreal  There is also a youth hostel attached to the hotel so we could use the kitchen and common room facilities and met a lot of nice people  On our way out the cleaning girl was cleaning one of the deluxe rooms  It was awesome like a  star hotel huge beautiful room with balcony overlooking the whole city  Did i mention the building Its special  Look at the photos on the site  
P => very good small hotel I had been staying in Old Montreal at the Nineteenth Century hotel for a few days  Changed to Hotel de Paris downtown in the plateau better price and better location  This is another beautiful building  The lobby was under reation but my room I asked for a luxury room was great  It was huge and had a large balcony overlooking the city  There is a youth hostel attached to the hotel and it was a nice place to meet some young people  Ann Munster 
P => One of the Worst Experiences This hotel was one of the worst in my experience  Dont stay there ifyou are over   It is noisy inside and out and the room was tiny and dirty  Dont be fooled by the romantic sounding name either   theres Nothing charming about this dilapidated old building  
P => not good hotel it is a hostal   for backpacker The hotel is not really a hotel it is a house refurnished to be a hotel old very old beds tv etc no shampo small towels breakfast offered is  bagelcoffe orange juice sample They have no clean up the room in the hotel neither trash pick up nor bed cleaning For the price we paid   CAD per night we can stay at Queen Elizabeth Fairmont s hotel so watch outThere is quotfree wirelessquot internet and local calls free No parking at all closest is a Double Tree parking lot about two blocks If you are backpacker it is ok but for same amount of money you mabe can get a better and real hotel No lugage help front desk people in morning has very bad attitude by the way we are paying    to guest  
P => Perfect spot when I am in downtown Montreal I find myself in Montreal on business and pleasure a few times a year  I had stayed at this Hotel a few years back and had really enjoyed it  I ided on my latest trip to stay there again as it is perfectly located for me to be able to walk to my meetings and then to be near the part of town I enjoy most at night the St  Denis area  The hotel has a very personal feel the staff are friendly and helpful  The building is architecturally beautiful with the unique look you see in Montreal and also with its castle like turrets  In fact I stayed in one of the quotturretquot rooms which was large and comfortable  The room and the bathroom were large clean and up to date Check in and out is simple and easy with a personal touch  Unlike the large sterile McHotels that are in downtown Montreal this one has a unique charm  
P => be Good for the Young I last stayed at Hotel de Paris in Montreal in early   I found it agreeable for the price plus it was safe clean and had a helpful staff  I found all of the above still true on this trip  But   things were also different this time around  In the seven years since my last stay the price has more than doubled  The sinking US dollar has made everything more expensive but I could see no real justification for the current cost per night  The hotel itself is a bit long in the tooth and in serious need of reation  I think an elevator would be a nice touch  Last time I stayed in a street level room this time on the third floor  Theres a hike of about  steps to get from the street to the main lobby  I now have bad knees and the going up to the lobby then three more flights of steps was an arduous task for me  I saw other middle aged customers struggling in the same way that I was  My room last time was rather small but this time my room and bathroom on the third floor were really tiny  You could not open the door alll the way to the room without hitting the bed  I could barely squeeze into the shower the opening was quot  The wi fi was spotty at best and quot TV was ginal at best  The free breakfeast consist of toast and bad coffee  There is no ice or soda machine  There are good things though  It is just a few blocks from the Metro which I found to be very convienent and in a nice neighborhood  Though tiny my room was clean and as before the staff is friendly and helpful  The hotel is attached with a youth hostel across the way and that seems to be the mindset of the owners  When I was their ages I didnt mind going up hundreds of steps to get anywhere but now that Im on the shady side of middle age it is a consideration But all in all I think I could have done better for the price  
P => Terrible I work for Ster Travel which is under the Expedia umbrella  so we received a certificate that we had to use on Expedia  we usually stay at Bedamp Breakfast spots when we go to Montreal but we couldnt find one on Expedia so we went with a hotel  My stepmom and my my father live in Montreal so we usually have them go and check out the spots after we book them and they told us that the bathroom was beautiful and that the hotel was in a ent area except if you go down one side street it gets shady  but overall she said the room that they showed here was pretty nice WRONG it was tiny  I mean you open the door an dthe bed is right there to your left  not even an inch away from the door  there was one chaie and one huge window facing another building  the bathroom was small that you couldnt take s hower without your elbow touching the shower wall  The temperature of the water would just change on its own  It was a nice looking bathroom which is eiving until you get in and realize how tiny it reallly is  If you suffer from clostophobia DO NOT stay at Hotel de Paris  
P => Theft of items at Hotel de Paris Our room was entered while we were away during the day and an assortment of items were stolen  We reported this to the hotel management submitted a very legitimate claim for   and then was quotstonewalledquot by the owner and manager for a few weeks  Promises were made and not kept  After constant contact with them they sent a check for   They never reported this to the police  Garage for car is a joke at   per night  Breakfast was a shoddy excuse  
P => very good boutique hotel I really enjoyed this hotel right near St  Denis and Park Lafonataine  Had a fine time sitting on the balcony and looking down to the river  Freindly staff  Will come again  
P => I would say find a better one    First of all I didnt see anywhere that says this is a HOSTEL  If it does say then I take the blame for it  Here is the storyWe arrived at the quotHotelquot and the lady was nice did the stuff and said see that house across the street you stay there  Im thinking this is the hotel we booked this is the hotel we saw on the pictures and thats the reason why we booked this hotel just so we can go accross the street in another house  Whatever We went there and the entrance looks like no one ever lived there  Grass and weed is growing everywhere  The room at first glance looks excellent but then you notice the walls are cracked the windows are falling apart and then we turned on the window AC which is probably from   Very loud and no cooling Ok we said we can go with this for   a night we expected anything The parking was on the street and my feeling was pretty much if you get it you get it if you dont get a ticket good for you No bed bugs and ently clean no complaints here Next morning we go for breakfast in the terrace  The buffet will almost collapse from its age but hey its an old building The breakfast includes ONE croissant coffee and fake orange juice in a glass that is half the size of a coffee cup  and the guy serving you is quotveryquot busy and lets you know that because he had  other people to serve and bring  croissants I get mixed feeling about this place  If you are level set that this is hostel and that you will pay some good money for just below average place then you might be happy Otherwise I would recommend to go with other place where things are for certain noteIt does look to me like some of the reviews are overblown  
P => Very Nice This hotel was nice A  minute walk from the bus station and St Dennis shopping area The room was large and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was included in the little cafe bext door    basic but nice  
P => Very good all purpose hotel Spectacular building this hotel seems to be constantly trying to get better  Everytime I have stayed here there was someting new  This time breakfast is included in the price and is served in a really nice little Bistro downstairs run by a funny Frenchman from of course Paris  There are a few types of room from budget to superior  I like the superior rooms in the Annex across the street  They are large and comfotable  We couldnt connect to the wifi which works haphzardly in our building but had free internet access to the wired terminal in the lobby   I donquott even consider going elsewhere the staff seems genuinely happy to converse and is friendly and helpful  They also remember me  I like that  
P => Great hotel downtown We loved our stay at Hotel de Paris  The staff is friendly and helpful rooms are nice and clean and the location is a few steps away from St Denis street  Excellent 
P => Great location beautiful building This is a terrific little hotel with friendly staff and if you like heritage buildings this is one lovely Victorian  I stayed in a deluxe room with my boyfriend for  nights  We had a balcony and great view of downtown  Dino at the front desk helped us find all the great night spots in town  I will come back here ia Grenouille 
P => Good budget hotel We stayed here for  nights right before New Years and we will definitely stay here again when we are in Montreal the next time  Definitely a good budget location for backpackers or  The location is great and there are a bunch or restaurants and pubs withing a walking distance  The room was a good size beds were comfortable enough and the staff was very helpful  The bathroom was fairly small but I have to say that it was clean  The same cannot be said about the carpets in the room especially under the beds as it looks like it has not been vacuumed for weeks  The parking situation was ent as there were parking places on both sides of Sherbrooke as well as on Saint Andre next to the hotel  
P => NASTY Avoid the nighte My experience with Hotel De Paris was so bad that I went out of my way to create a tripadvisor account and write this review I also want to agree with another comment regarding the assumption that the good reviews were written by the hotel staffowner  If you look at their accounts you will see that those accounts were used only once to write those reviews  I found this hotel on hotwire com  Since I usually have good luck with hotwire I booked Hotel De Paris for  nights over New Years weekend  The hotel was rated  stars comparable to a Doubletree so I paid  a night  Hotel De Paris is the worst hotel I ever stayed at The hotel is really dirty and smells  The room was tiny  The carpet was dirty and didn t look like it was vacuumed for a very long time  The sheets and comforter were disgusting and didn t look like they ve been washed  The walls were extremely thin you can hear everything  The bathroom had stains and was gross  The hotel should be rated  star or a low scale hostel  I tried to upgradeswitch room but the other rooms were worse  FYI I checked out their web site and the rooms are nowhere close to the pictures  Also I woke up after the third night this morning with bed bug bites on my arms and legs  I have already written an email to hotwire telling them that I will never use their service again  Please do yourself a favor and never stay at this hotel Our friends got into the Hyatt priceline for the same price we paid 
P => great location I had a real good timein this hotel  Was easy to walk all over and the receptionist spoke perfect spanish an helped me a lot  The room was nice and breakfast very good  Jorge 
P => Excellent place to stay Ive been to this hotel a few times and always found clean rooms and they do have different room categories for you to choose  The staff is friendly and they always help you with any questions you might have Its a few minutes walk from St Denis Street great place 
P => Dirty smelly and possibly disease ridden They dont mention anywhere on their website that they are also a hostel  Not to mention a very bad hostel who puts their guests in the musty basement  I am so sorry for anyone who books this hotel  Their pictures on their website are so cute and quaint but I swear these rooms do not exist  The hotel staff is not friendly and helpful as some of the reviews state  I really think the positive reviews are writen by the hotel staff themselves  The walls were so thin that I could hear my neighbors urinating and every other sound they made I cant believe this hotel has not been shut down for fraud  It truly is the worst hotel Ive ever stayed in  Do yourself a favor and stay someplace safe and nice for the same price THE PLACE SMELLS AND THE SHEETS WERE FILTHYEven worse the front desk refused to refund my first night stay when I informed them I could not possibly sleep in such a dirty bed  I left and found a room at the Sheraton downtown and actually payed less than the Hotel de Paris  
P => Stay Away from Hotel de Paris After making a reservation with the Hotel de Paris more then a month and a half ago and receiving a confirmation from their website I assumed that my vacation in Montreal would go with out a hitch  Upon checking in I tell the person at the desk that I have a reservation for the superior Queen Room in Annex   He then asks me if I want sheets   silly question of course I then ask if the hotel de Paris was a hotel to which he replies yes but they also have a hostel  What kind of hotel is   Star  and has a hostel Anyway the quotconciergequot proceeds to search for my reservation everywhere but the computer and informs me that he couldnt find my reservation and that the hotel was completely booked  Even with the confirmation information he was unwilling to be accommodating  There is a computer in the lobby and I checked my reservation and it was still active  How is it that they were unable to locate it After almost  hours of trying to find us a room the person at the desk finally called the Sam W who I assume is the owner of the hotel  Sam W instructed the person at the desk to find us a room in another hotel  The first  hotel  was Hotel de la Cassa  If this location is comparable to the Hotel de Paris then they really should remodel  First we had to be buzzed in to the Hotel de la Cassa and the women was behind what looked like a prison window and did not speak either French or English well and frankly the lobby smelled like cat pee  We needed two rooms and there was only one so we had to return to the Hotel de Paris  Upon seeing us again the person at the desk called back Sam W  After several minutes of them conversing Sam W promised that they would find us a room in another hotel and that the Hotel de Paris would pick up the difference  All we would have to do is call the manager Monday morning Hector Z  This was an obvious lie because upon checking out of the hotel that they found for us on Monday we called the manager Hector Z and he proceeded to say that Sam W had never spoken to him and that it wasn t his problem and that the reservation that I had made was through an independent web site not true at all since I went to the Hotel de Paris website and made the reservation through them and received a confirmation through the Hotel After suspecting fraudulent activity I am still monitoring my credit card I contacted the police who said they would make a note of our situation but it was a civil matter  I have my suspicions if they are actually a hotel  I am unsure why the Hotel de Paris is so highly rated  I would really think twice before staying here  
P => Total Nighte Beware all I saw the hotels website and liked the pictures of the rooms so I reserved their largest hotel room for my family  I should have heeded the other terrible reviews on this site but like a fool I chose to stay here  It is not conveniently located as the reviews state as well  I have a feeling the hotel staff writes the good reveiws themselves  The building has been remodeled but very badly  When we got to our room and opened the door the smell was terrible and the room was the shabbiest  a night room I had ever seen  Although the bathroom was remodeled it did not make up for the dirty green carpet non working tv tiny room for  and dirty radiator with garbage inside the floor area arouond the radiator  One of the beds which were hard as rocks had a pull out bed  When I pulled it out the sheets were filthy and the actual pullout drawer was disgusting full of dirt and hair  When I informed the guy at the front desk he said he would get us new sheets  My husband insisted on speaking with the owner but the front desk guy said he had no idea where he was or when he would be there  We had to pay for one night but never ended up staying there  That would have ruined our trip to Montreal  We got a room at the Springhill Suites in Old Town instead for  more a night  Also the parking for  they offer is street parking and you cannot park on the street from  to  pm  We also found out the place mostly rents out beds to people who cannot afford rooms  The environment around the hotel was shady  We actually saw a group of people doing drugs around the corner  Horrible  
P => Bring Earplugs Considering that recent reviews have been so positive I was really disappointed with this place  My stay was over two nights in the quotEdith Piafquot room which is Room  in the quotannex quot The annex is the hotels building on the SW corner of Sherbrooke amp St Andre  The main part of the hotel is on the NE corner  My biggest problem with the hotel was that the walls were paper thin and the guy staying in the adjacent Room  snored like a Harley Davidson at full throttle  He slept early in the night  even all night long and well into the next morning  We theorized he had sleep apnea because the buzzsawing was in fits and starts  We could also hear TV sets people urinating etc  The room itself was attractive with a high ceiling and hardwood floors  The bed was rock hard swayed worringly and squeeked loudly with every slight movement  It wasnt a quotbudgetquot room since we paid a net of  CAD for the two nights  However it was furnished like a budget room with two small towels no washrags two tiny latherless pieces of quotLisaquot soap which were not replaced on the second day no shampoo no hair dryer no nothing  The wall was peeling the thermostat didnt seem to work it was hotsultry despite the lowest setting and there was a faint odor of old tobacco even though there were no drapescarpeting to harbor such an odor  Parking was in a tiny dark dirty garage below an apartment house for  per day  I would step into a puddle of goopy water when I exited the car at my assigned parking space   However you would in all likelihood be able to find parking on St Andre just north of Sherbrooke if you dont mind leaving your car on the street  In sumy the hotel was underwhelming  If you dare to stay here pray that your neighbors are not snorers 
P => Make yourself at home    This is the third time I stay at L Hotel de Paris in Montreal  It seems everytime I come it only gets better  They have a variety of room types available  This time I opted for the suite room  i think it was and i gotta say wow Its a large room with a big bed and a nice balcony up front  It seems they ve done some reations over the winter because i noticed all the corridors have been redone and really spruces up the place  A nice new thing they offer is a free continental breakfast  They also have a Bistro on site but it was only opening in il  The staff is very friendly and really make you feel at home  Its not a huge hotel so I guess it is easier to make a personal connection with the clients  There s a new young guy working there whos a lot of fun and full of good advice about the city  I recommend this place and I d defintalely keep coming back  
P => Very satisfactory I attend a conference in Montreal every ember and stay here all the time  The rooms are clean and comfortable and for the first time this year they added a free breakfast I noticed that there were some other changes also and the place is quaint and very Montreal  I find the location convenient the staff reliable and friendly and I like the price 
P => the room matters I stayed here based entirely on the price  The adds said  so i figured if its ent for that price id stay  And the  price was the value of the room  It was not perfectly kept but i was good enough to sleep in for me and id say most people  Then i asked what the other more expensive rooms were like and they said quotnicerquot So i had a look and for some more money the rooms were a significant step up  So i bought a more expensive room and it was luxurious  I think that the bad reviews about the rroms are from people paying  for a room and expective the luxury suites  Look if you pay the  to get the luxury sweet you get a luxury swet it you pay  buck you get a  room  Hotel de paris is not the greatest deal of all time but its fair and you get what you pay for plus there are some perks lik the nice costomer service  Id stay here againjim from victoria BC 
P => This place is AWFUL I stayed at this hotel with my husband  Everything about this place was terrible  The ceiling was leaking it smelled of mold  I asked for a better room and the guy at the desk said I dont have they key to the good room  
P => For a good time in Montreal follow these directions    I have been to Montreal a number of times and have stayed at this hotel a few times  Basically it is cheap clean and central with a good dose of old world charm However when I visited this time my whole view of the hotel and Montreal completely changed  WHAT A HOTEL CAFE The food was fantastic super cheap and the girls running it really made my visit They made me maps and told me exactly where to go to really experience Montreal  I have been to Montreal a number of times but this time was the first I didnt feel like a tourist  The cafe is a meeting point for fellow travellers and local with people meeting up for coffee or drinks while they explore the city  Apparently they also have a hip hop brunch on Saturdays Its all the best of Montreal vibrant and hip while remaining friendly and accessible  I am planning my next visit right now and wouldnt stay anwyhere else 
P => Perfect for a girls night out We stayed at this Hotel a bunch of times now and we simply love it Everytime we go to Montreal for a girls night out we always rent the ATTIC room room  I thinkand we have a blast We usually are     girls so for us the deal is great  There is plenty of room for everyone to sleep   the room has  double beds so no one ever has to sleep on the floor Girls just one tip though   bring an extra mirror There is only one in the bathroom and its tiny Just to avoid any cat fightsLOL 
P => Balcony rooms are great Just stayed at the Hotel de Paris not the hostel next door for the third time with my husband  We really enjoy the place but I think it is probably not for everyone First it would not be for anyone with bad knees  Just getting into the lobby is quite a steep climb from the street  Second it would not be for light sleepers   at least not on summer weekends  Montreal is a late night town and the rooms at the front especially get a lot of street noise  That said we like to stay in the front in one of two rooms with a rooftop balcony   a fantastic place to chill with a beverage and some conversation  In fact the balcony is the whole point for us   the view of Rue Sherbrooke and downtown is wonderful  Weve stayed in both rooms that share the balcony and they were both nice  We were much less impressed with the standard balcony less room where we stayed on our first visit  Of course the balcony makes sense only in the summer  In the winter its likely to have four feet of snow on it The hotel would not be a bad choice in the neighborhood even if you opt for the less expensive rooms without the balcony  Its clean enough the staff is ent the or is pleasant if slightly faded  But there  be better choices  In fact in winter we prefer to stay across the street and down a block at the more comfortable but slightly less atmospheric Hotel Chateau de lArgoat If you do stay in the neighborhood dont miss Parc LaFontaine a great place for a stroll or a run  In winter there is ice skating in a pond with high embankments that protect skaters from the wind Im also a big fan of the Cafe Cherrier a bistro at Cherrier amp St  Denis  
P => Rude Obnoxious Staff I stayin this dump for the Grand Prix weekend and I thought I was going to catch some sort of plague from its disgustingly dirty showers and bathrooms  One of the four showers that served thirty people only worked in the scalding hot position  I left a pair of sunglasses there when I left and even though I told the staff exactly where I left them and asked them nicely if they would look for them they refused and when I called back the second time I was abruptly told that they were not found and then I was hung up on  Also the Air Conditioning unit for the entire building was IN our room and even if you could stand the noise of it it was impossible to sleep because it was too cold in the room  
P => Horrible place to stay They say on the hostel website that all the bathrooms and matresses are new I dont know about the matresses but the bathrooms certainly were not new they had mold on the walls and only one of the three toilets with showers locked and up to  people had to share those  toiletsThe bunk beds felt like they were about to fall apart and the room smelt damp The staff are extremely rude and if you ask for a refund of your deposit after you see the room they wont give it back to you eitherIt is a rip off for the quality you get  The Hotel La Residence next door actually worked out cheaper than the hostel when u added the price of renting sheets a towel and buying a little breakfast  It was small but it was clean and they were very friendly I wouldnt advise anyone to stay at the Hotel de Paris hostel and i dont think the hotel is much better I heard from talking to guests staying in the hotel part apart from one or two rooms that is  
P => Clean HotelHostal I stayed at Hotel de Paris in  and it was very clean and neat    I went there with my girl and I must say that we are a very picky bunch but we all agreed that this we would stay here for the weekend  I t was comfortable  We stayed in a budget suite for  adults I think it was with two double beds and a  tv   We had a view of the street so we see our car parked on the side street  There was not much parking   The parking for this building was in another building how weird is that  It was very complicated  Whenever you went out you had to go to the front desk and ask for the key then return it when you got your car out    A bit too much walking around  Terrible parking arrangements and they charge day        and youre not even garaunteed a parking because they share  This hotel has no elevator so you have to stair it    Its located in an ok location  The clubs try Cresent St  or St Laurent are about  mins walk eatry and other action St  Denis about  stop lights up  very busy  a lot of food places and store along this street  Another busy street St Catherines  Dont forget to check out Victoria Sq    about     mins drive away Overall this hotel was clean beds were made bathroom clean cable tv   the staff was helpful somewhat friendly   parking sucks but it is reasonable and clean what more can you ask for   Dont be scared because it is a hostal because honestly I didnt know about it until i read it somewhere and that was when I was leaving checking out  It was nowhere near a hostal in my eyes  The outer or is a bit ancient but dont be fooled the place is clean Enjoy your stay like I did at Hotel De Paris 
P => Nice little hotel This is a smaller hotel with nice clean rooms  I stayed in what was called a budget room with a double bed  The room was clean with a cute bathroom and cable T V  All in all a great little place for the price  The hotel had nice staff a great location and a good breakfast with plenty of parking  All in all we had a very pleasurable stay  
P => great value for money This is a very good little hotel very reasonably priced with a wide variety of rooms  I saw some really large beautiful rooms as well as some very small ones at great prices  There is also an affiliated youth hostel across the street so you can sleep in montreal right downtown at any price range you choose from  to  canadian  I stayed with my wife in a very clean budget room at  canadian dollars about  US we had a private bathroom and the front desk was very helpful  
P => Any other hotel is better ANY This place must have one or two good rooms if one is to believe the reviews but the rest are a total pig sty Smelly smokey filthy old thread bare utterly disgusting  I think the pictures on the net are fake or hugely PhotoShopped  The staff is rude too  These guys have buildings all over the street nobody on site  Unbelievable bad choice  Any other hotel on Sherbrooke West is better and cheaper Dont waste your time and money you  catch something from those sheets too UGH 
P => Great locarion This hotel was actually very good  The location is ideal  I had a luxury room at  canadian and everything was brand new including the furniture  The place was spotless  Also my dhter who will attend University in Montreal stayed at the adjacent youth hostel and had a good time and met some new friends also students looking for apartments  Someone seems to have an axe to grind about this place  I was very satisfied  
P => Disgusting filthy and totally misrepresented  
P => the luxury rooms are really nice   
P => Hotel vs Backpacker sectionsa difference

P => The Gay Villages best place to stay for its convenience service and price  I have been staying in the Hotel Dorion during all of my stays in Montreal for the last  years due to its convenient location in the Gay Village and because of its reasonable prices  During my recent stay at the Hotel Dorion I was pleasantly surprised by all of the improvements in the hotel since my last visit two years ago  A new wing has been added which is nicer than the old section with its attractive clean modern rooms and with air conditioning  My room also had a refrigerator and a fabulous Jacuzzi  Other improvements are that the hotel now offers a continental breakfast on weekends fresh coffee is available  hours a day and the hotel now has wireless Internet service  The most noticeable improvement is the competent new management of the hotel especially Joanne who is a delight to be around and who is completely on top of the situation  Raymond and Carlos were also very helpful to us and very friendly  The bilingual staff provided good service and a friendly atmosphere at the Hotel Dorion  Everyone that I encountered was very accommodating such as helping me with driving directions or making sure that I have fresh towels and everything that I need in my room  I like the fact that the staff obviously cares about their guests  With the new improvements at the Hotel Dorion I wouldn t consider staying anywhere else in Montreal  For convenience and service at a reasonable price it is the best place to stay in the Gay Village  I would definitely recommend it to my friends 
P => affordable hotel in montreals gay village even though this hotel is located directly above club taboo gay strip club it is very quiet  plus the staff members are very nice and the rooms are clean   a metro subway station is located very close by as well as banks grocery store and of course gay clubs  old montreal and chinatown are within walking distance  my only reservation about this hotel are the staircases      they are fairly steep so youll get plenty of exercise even while walking up to the front desk area  be sure to ask for a non smoking room if you dont smoke the hotel dorion is a good place to stay regardless of what your budget is  
P => Hotel Dorion Friendly Clean Great Location   I stayed at the Hotel Dorion from Christmas through the New Year  and I believe it was a good value the price  The  staff was very friendly it has a secure entrance that you have to buzz to gain entrance  It is within walking distance of the Gay Village  The linens were clean there is no room service but they will exchange towels sheets etc  if you bring them to the front desk  They have a continental breakfast on weekends which is ok because there are some great restaurants nearby  The Metro Papeniau is across the street a superket on the corner a Drugstore on another corner The Taboo        club and bar downstairs  The showers can however be kinda tricky with the hot water adjustments  I am returning this winter and I will be staying in the new addition  The rooms are suppose to be larger and quiter  Well see   
P => The Dorion is nice if you are a smoker The Hotel Dorion was quite nice seemed to be recently remodeled bathrooms were new and there were no problems with noise from the bar downstairs from the rd floor which is where I believe all the overnight rooms are located  The AC in the room was provided by a window unit which was noisy but not any more so than units I have owned in the past  The staff were very pleasant  However the room absolutely reeked of tobacco smoke to the point that I had difficulty breathing and felt really sick at points  To be fair the hotel has no smoking signs plastered all over the place so this is mostly a case of the patrons being   However one would think they could install those very sensitive smoke detectors as they have in airplanes or take some other kind of measures to solve this problem  In any case I would recommend this as a great budget hotel for those who smoke or live with a smoker and are used to the smell  Otherwise look elsewhere  
P => Great low budget hotel in the gay village Located in Montreals gay village and above a male dancer bar this hotel is popular with gay men  Whilst the music from the bar downstairs was not loud this isnt a quiet hotel   though you can certainly get a good nights sleep okay   The gay village is buzzing with bars clubs and restaurants so this is an ideal location for anyone on a budget like I was  Canadian wanting to be able to walk back after am   The room was adequate  Clean room and linen comfortable bed and enough space  Color TV with cable channels air conditioning telephone in the room  The ensuite bathroom was very small with a shower but again adequate   You enter the hotel by a buzzer at the front door reception is on the second floor  Video cameras monitor all coridoors which are clean and well lit   Breakfast is only available at weekends but there is a fab  cafe just across the road  Subway is just one short block from the hotel  Nearest bar is ten yards from the hotel   Hotel address Hotel Dorion  Dorion Montreal HK A  Tel               or toll free

P => Wonderful clean hotel with all the amenities in a neighborhood setting My husband and I enjoyed everything about our visit  We loved the king sized suite that even had extra pillows and blanket which you usually dont get in a king size room  There was a kitchennette which was handy and a charming local grocery right next door  Parking was easy  The staff was especially friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the location  it was quiet from the noise of the city yet right in the heart of the downtown restaurants and sights  
P => Good Stay Booked directly with the Hotel exchange a few emails and the customer service very good Peggy very helpful and answer all my qeries without any unhappy Room good sizeDeluxe we paid  Canadian Dollars per room without breakfast  Close to Subways station  The problem is you need walk through the tunnel about  mins for highup walk From station walk to the hotel about  mins  Tip Another station nearby and you dont need walk through the tunnel you need change the line not direct to the hotel is the problemNot much trouble many restaurant nearby the hotel post office and superket very close too  Although not too close to downtown but the subway very easy to catch and cheap too Happy our stayes at Hotel Du Fort 
P => Will defintely stay at Hotel Du Fort again  I chose this hotel because of the mostly postive reviews here and I wasnt disappointed  I think its a pretty good value compared to nearby places  We had one of the smaller rooms but it was still plenty big enough with a small kitchenette hidden behind folding doors  And a little coffeepot plus a real mug and spoon Everything was clean and we had a wonderful view from our window There were a lot of restaurants within a few blocks be not the really nicehigh end places but moderately priced places with lots of ethnic food choices  The old city was a bit far for us to walk to but we just drove down and parked in that big lot by the water  Id skip the breakfast buffet and go to Tutti Fruitti instead   its about three blocks away on St  Catherine  
P => Good Comfortable Hotel With Some Issues Stayed at Hotel du Fort Montreal for a one week vacation this past ust  The hotel is located on RueStreet Fort right off St  Catherine the main commercial street in the city Please note that this section of St Catherine is not the commercial downtown section withall the chic shops and restaurants   rather the area where the hotel is located is a largelyresidential quieter section of Montreal   not a bad thing as you will find many interesting shops and boutiques and reasonably priced restaurants here The hotel is about  minutes walking distance from downtown there are also three Metro stations within a three to four block radius of the Hotel du Fort Atwater Guy Concordia and Georges Vanier to get you anywhere in the city you want to go  The Georges Vanier station is just two stops away from the Central train station for those arriving or leaving Montreal by train As for the hotel itself it is a medium sized residential style property with large spacious and quite comfortable rooms with spectacular views of the city especially from the upper floors  The room type I stayed in was the King Signature which had a siiting area with a sofa and lounge chair A wooden divider with a makeup table lamp and hair dryer arated this living area from the sleeping area which contained the bed and a small chair  In addition the room contains a large desk armoire with a TV and dresser drawers a large closet a kitchenette with refrigerator and a good sized bathroom  The bathroom was well appointed with such convieniences as erate switches for the light and the fan safety bars in the shower a non slip tub floor and a laundry line features which are not always found in more expensive properties at least not all in one room  That said this bathroom had two items which I found rather disappoiting   a very powerful shower with a narrow water jet which was anything but comfortable and non adjustable  Also instead of the usual bottles of toiletries there were wall dispensers in the shower for shampoo soap etc  Perhaps the hotel is trying to be enviromentally freindly but I found this rather cheesy and motel like for hotel of this caliber  One other observation regarding the room   the website indicates all the rooms have flatscreen TVs   this turns out not to be the case  When I asked the manager on duty about this he said that those TVs are only in the suites  This  be important to some not so much to others but I thought I should mention it Now to the issues I alluded to in the title of my review  These concern the breakfast and thebusiness center  The breakfast buffet no ala carte menu available served in a very elegantroom with large picture windows is described on the website as having hot and cold items   in truth the only hot item every morning was scrambled eggs  The other items were of the continental variety   fruit pastries cold cuts juice coffee  The breakfast was certainly not bad but for the price   CAD I did expect a bit more As to the business center located right off the breakfast room please note that there is onlyone computer available fro everyones use  During my stay I usually had to wait longer thanusual to use the computer this experience culminated one night with several guests inckud ing myself complaining about one guest hogging the computer for over an hour  To the hotels everlasting credit the front desk staff remedied this situation immediatel and removed the offender  Also to their credit I recently received a letter fron the hotel manager apologiz  ing for my experience in this matter and told me that the computer use policy has since been revised to allow each guest  minutes use on said computer and in addition I was offered a complimentary room upgrade for a future stay  I sincerely hope that this policy will be adher  ed to and respected by all the guests  What this would mean is how much of a priority the use of the business center is to you during your vacation The front desk staff was very freindly and efficient in all other matters as well  They mademe feel very welcome and made many recommendations for my sightseeing restaurant andtransportation needs while in Montreal  In regard to the latter the concierge can furnish youwith an Opus card for   which is good for unlimited trips on the citys subways and buses  You can refill the card yourself when the encoded value runs out  You must return thecard at checkout or you will be charged the   on your bill The housekeeping staff were also excellent except for an unknown housekeeper who withgood intentions Im sure left my room windows open on the two hottest days of my stay  Thiswas not a big issue though and I let it pass In sumy the Hotel du Fort is a very pleasant hotel to stay in  Centrally located in a quaint quiet neighborhood it has large comfortable rooms a caring staff and reasonable rates  And if the above issue with the business center are indeed resolved then the hotel will be evenmore inviting P S  For those of you looking for additional shopping and dining there is a large shopping mallthree blocks from the hotel  It is the Place Alexis Nihon and contains a McDonalds good forbreakfast and sinfully delicious pastries   believe me on this a food court and shops for all your needs especially the basic things you  need for your trip  It is located atop the Atwater Metro station and across the street from the Pepsi Forum a huge sports entertainment complex  
P => A Small Apartment   Great Location Great time in Montreal  Hotel is older and was like having a small comfy apartment in the city  We had a huge corner room with a kitchenette bedroom dining room and living room   extremely comfortable  Its right off St  Catherine Blvd  where we walked to restaurants and the center of the city  We chose to take a taxi to Old Montreal vs  drive  Its too far to walk  The breakfast is in a lovely dining room and was okay at   but we typically had breakfast in our room  A grocery store is across the street  Free internet was great and parking was only  a day  The halls had a little musty smell but we didnt notice it in our very clean room  It was a little dated but very comfortable and we would stay again  
P => Good location good value top ks Hotel Du Fort is in a great location for exploring the City by foot or on the Subway  It is located off one of the main shopping and restaurant roads so theres plenty of choice for meals Our room was spacious and comfortable  We found the hotel staff helpful and happy to help  
P => Comfortable  We stayed only one night at the Hotel du Fort but we wished wed booked for longer  Stayed here on our annual trip to drop our son off at McGill  It was not too far from his apartment and convenient to the Metro and downtown  The room was huge bed comfortable price reasonable  Parking was convenient and about the going rate for a city hotel around  I think  Nice view of downtown  The exercise room was nice and well equipped but for some odd reason the treadmill was locked and required a special key from the front desk  My only complaint is the for fee internet access  I HATE paying for internet access  
P => Nice stay right in the center of Montreal I have selected the hotel based on reviews on Tripadvisor and it turned out pretty good  We stayed  days  It is located next to St Catherine street which is walking distance to shopping centers great restautants and underground city  There were two grocery stores accross hotel  Hotel is about  min walk to the subway which was very convenient for us coming to the hotel from the train station as well as travelling to botanical garden and Olympic Stadium  All staff spoke English and were pretty helpful  The room was nice and pretty big with king bed and sofa  Nice bathroom  I also used the gym in the hotel which was not big but had enough machines to exercise  Very nice value for the price we paid  Hotel exceeded our expectations  I will definetely stay again and recommend to the friends  
P => Good Value Hotel in Convenient Location  Stayed here for a couple of nights during a roadtrip across Canada amp USA  Had seen the reviews on Tripadvisor amp got a discounted rate from the tourist information place  The hotel is very clean amp has friendly efficient service  There is parking at the hotel  I really liked our room it had a great view amp the bed was very comfy  It is around a   minute walk to the shopping areas amp barsrestaurants etc  Recommended  
P => Great Hotel  I stayed there for my Birthday and overall a great trip  No meals or that included but averall a good value  It was close to the metro for easy access to shopping clubs and other activities  Very clean and pretty good meals in the restaurant  
P => EXCELLENCE ALL AROUND Stayed at Du Fort for  nights with my friends and absolutely loved it  Service is exceptional rooms are spacious location is excellent Hotel Du Fort is located  blocks away from Crescent St  if you are a college student its the place to be and right next to St Catherines all the restaurants and shops  Everything is in a walkable distance and away from all the noise  The hotels staff is professional and friendly  Metro is few blocks down the closest bar is across the street Sports bar  very cheap breakfast and bar food  Also parking is about  bucks a day with in and out access but you really dont need your car metro will take you practically everywhereTIPSCrescent St  BARS CLUBSSt Catherines  FOOD SHOPPINGSt Laurent  CLUBSSt Dennis  HOOKAH BARS 
P => An Amazing Boutique Hotel Where  Hospitality  is Their Standard This gem is off the beaten path but is extremely convenient to just about anywhere youd want to go in charming Montreal  I cant recall a hotel where everyone   and I do mean everyone   is quietly there for you and more than willing to make your stay as comfortable and hassle free as it can be  My wife and I experienced this with all from the front desk to the chamber maid on up to the General Manager They are all glad that you are their guest   and they show it The rooms are very spacious clean and have a very handy kitchenette with microwave refrigerator sink and coffeetea and a coffeemaker  Very easy to feelquotat homequot This hotel must have the best smelling elevators in town as the aroma of freshly baked croissants waif up from the beautiful breakfast parlor on the second floor  Here is a wonderful breakfast buffet serving hot and cold fresh foods to satisfy any appetite If youre looking for a worry free wonderful hotel that delivers more than it promises we heartily recommend this Montreal gem to you  Youll be glad you followed this advice 
P => Handy location Superbly friendly staff comfy beds Having kitchenettes in the rooms drastically reduced our overall trip expenses  The staff was extremely courteous and helpful  The rooms were very clean and comfortable  We have stayed there periodically since  and always appreciate the accommodations and the location is wonderful for us   just minutes from local transportation  
P => Good basic hotel  Very friendly staff  We stayed at the Hotel du Fort for the first time this y  The best part for us was the friendly staff  They were courteous and helpful  The room we stayed in was large and comfortable the or was pretty basic  The only problem we encountered was the first room we were in had not been cleaned before our arrival and had a damaged tub faucet  We were very quickly moved to a new room which was larger than the one we started in  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed  There was a small kitchen area which was great for storing extra food and keeping it cold before we traveled again and there was an area for drying your hair with a mirror built into a table  Rue du Fort is just off Saint Catherine so there are many restaurants and shops in the area though we did find ourselves walking quite a lot to see some of the attractions we were interested in  The last day of our stay we went to the breakfast buffet not included in the cost of the room and liked it a lot  We would stay here again and would recommend it to others  The Hotel displayed an electronic quotbillboardquot near the elevators detailing Concierge recommendations  This was a nice touch  
P => Excellent hotel I stayed here for two nights to attend a conference in Westmount  Although there was an initial mix up with my room it was quickly and pleasantly sorted out  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed the toiletries are delightful  The front desk staff was always helpful no matter the time of day or the number of guests they were handling at the time  In particular they knew just how to hail a cab The breakfast is very good and again the staff in the breakfast room equally pleasant  I plan to return to Hotel du Fort the next time I am in Montreal  
P => Adventure Central We love Hotel du Fort  We have recommended it to several of our friends and they have never come away dissatisfied  We are frequent fliers at the hotel its our first choiceHotel du Fort is located in an quotup and comingquot area of Montreal  The Pepsi Arena is nearby as are new restaurants Le Mizo etc  There are many shops and botiques in the area as well as stores where one  expeirence local produce and cuisine  The Atwater Metro is two blocks near by  The hotel is conveniently located and easily accessible to the weary traveller or those seeking some adventure  The parking garage is exceptionally clean and well lighted and everything is handicap accessible Hotel du Fort continually seeks to improve service to its guests  The new breakfast menue has ben modified to be more pleasing to the guests The staff as e veryone agrees is very professional and welcoming  They are very patient with me when I try to speak French at the front desk merci  Everyone should experience Hotel du Fort TMAP 
P => Nice clean hotel Good location large clean rooms quiet  The hallway on the floor we stayed on smelled a little weird but other than that its a nice hotel  
P => Splendid Stay My husband and I stayed for  nights at this hotel in e and really enjoyed our stay  The hotel staff is very professional and do a great job of answering your questions thoroughly This hotel just off a major street Saint Catherine and close to Guy Concordia or the Atwater Metro stops  The hotel room was large and had a great kitchette with a sink frig  microwave and coffeemaker  The lovely bathroom was very large too  The hotel had a nice gym and a grocery store and Internet cafe across the street  There are lots of stores resturants and bars along St  Catherine so finding a place to eat was not difficult  Many of the bars amp resturants have English menus and the people of Montreal speak English well and often  The hotel had a great sports bar across the street Sports Stadium the place had great food cheap beer and tasty poutine fries with beef gravy and melted cheese curds Yum Gotta try it Montreal is a large city and the major sites are spread out so be prepared to walk drive or take the Metro subway  At the airport we were able to get to our hotel very easily and inexpensively by using two public buses and the subway  Make sure you have exact change before you get on the bus We did not have a car but used the subway countless times throughout our trip to get to what we wanted to see  The subway is very user friendly but get a  day pass because the cost of a ride is   no matter the distance  The people of Montreal are so nice and helpful  We loved visiting Montreal and wed go back again and would stay at the Hotel Du Fort   
P => A surprise A fellow traveler selected this place  I was skeptical due to the location and on first impression of the outside and the neighborhood  But inside the place was nicer than it looked  And on getting out into the neighborhood there were lots of stores and shops within a block or two that made the visit unexpectedly pleasant  Unless you know your way around Montreal or are exceptional at directions better take a GPS to get there from the airport  Its in an old part of town with lots of one way streets crisscrossed by freeways  
P => Comfortable and spacious This is a great little hotel with spacious rooms and kitchenette very handy for snacks and breakfasts Beds are comfortable and linens are very nice  The location cant be beat     minutes to Ste Catherine  
P => Loved the breakfast I got a suite in this hotel thanks to my travel agent at the same cost as a normal room  my office was only a  min walk from here on st  catherines  the front desk is very help ful to tourists and they helped me identifying the must visit spots in montreal  they also informed me about the events happening in the weekend The american breakfast is included in the room expense  it is quite good  you will find many tourists in the hotelthe hotel has a gym though it is very small  you will get internet connectivity to complete your office work but you  find it on the slower side  
P => all round good hotel Stayed there for a weekend  It wasnt the best but it was quite good for the price  The location of the hotel is within downtown and is walkable to the subway station and other main attractions  
P => Very friendly and comfortable place to stay The Hotel Du Fort was a real pleasure to stay in during my last visit to Montreal  Location wise the hotel is just of Rue Sainte Catherine which has a great choice of cafes bars and shops  Its about a  minute walk to the nearest Metro stations of Atwater and Guy Concordia I would recommend using the latter station  The city centre is easy to reach by metro and can also be reached by foot in about  to  minutes Taxi from the airport cost me CAD  but its a set fare in Montreal to the city centre hotels The staff at the Hotel Du Lac I found to be absolutely brilliant very professional helpful and polite  Especially the staff on reception  Though all the staff that I passed during my stay from cleaners to managers took time to smile and say hello which really makes a difference I was allocated room  which was very spacious well orated clean and very comfortable  Room has  double beds and a small kitchenette with a fridge and a microwave  Good sized bathroom and with being on the th floor an excellent view of downtown Montreal Breakfast was at CAD  in a pleasant comfortable room ent buffet spread and pleasant service Definetly will stay here again on my next time in Montreal  
P => Best Keep Secret   Montreal Gem My boyfriend and I were both very impressed with hotel du Fort  A four star property in the best location for the price of a three star  In town for festivale Juste Pour Rire we were is good spirits but nothing went wrong anyway  I am very picky and have very high expectations  In North America I accept no less than a four star  I ran my finger atop the mantel for dust  I was impressed  We recommend this hotel for cosmopolitan twenty something Canadians and others with comparable taste  
P => Loved it I recently stayed at the Hotel du Fort for a week at the beginning of ober  and two days at the end of the same month  I am a professional travel writer so I spend A LOT of time in hotels  I didnt know what to expect but the online reviews were good so I gave the Hotel du Fort a shot  I am very glad I did  When I called to reserve the woman who answered was friendly and professional  When I checked in I was pleased to find that the room was spacious and had a nice view of the city  It was also very clean and well appointed  Everyone on the staff was friendly bilingual and helpful  The capper was when my wife called from overseas and asked if the staff could help her give me an anniversary present  One of the front desk staff went out and bought chocolates and a card and hand delivered them to my room  The Hotel du Fort hits all the right notes and it was very pleasant to come quothomequot to each day  I highly recommend it  It is a great value for the price  What more can I say I wish all the places I stay in were like this  
P => Great Place Great Staff The best thing among many good things at the Hotel Du Fort is the helpfulness of the front desk and concierge  They always had great information about things to do and places to eat  The location is also great just off Catherine St  but far enough off that we did not notice any noise  The Hotel Du Fort is quite reasonably priced  We would definitely stay here again  If you are driving be sure to reserve a place in the underground garage  At  a day with in and out privileges it is steal  
P => Great rooms views and location My boyfriend and I spent a weekend at the Hotel du Fort over the summer  The location was perfect   we walked everywhere  We were very impressed with the size and cleanliness of the rooms  Would definitely stay again  
P => Excellent We spent  nights here and thought it was fantastic  Our room was big with a kitchenette and sitting area and a ent size bathroom  The service was impeccable  We didnt have the breakfast so I cant comment on that  The location of the hotel is also good only about  minutes walk from the Eaton Centre and  blocks from the Metro  There are some good restaurants nearby as well as a superket so everything is convenient  Highly recommended 
P => LOVED DU FORT The Du Fort is ideally located only steps away from St Catherines Street  VERY clean With the exception of one crabby guy at reception the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful A definite must and for the price    it was a great dealWill definitely stay at the Du Fort on our next trip back to Montreal  
P => A first rate experience  I have been at the hotel with my wife for a weekend at the end of our vacation  We found the staff to be friendly and really helpful on this our first visit to Montreal  They helped us plan our day do the online check in for our flight home and printed the boarding passes and for an extra fee  extended our checking out time essentially giving us another morning to explore the area We stayed on the th floor      the view is fine and the room is unusually large though probably one of the smaller ones  We agree that the hotel is a little way out from the centre but found the immediate area alive with all manner of characters and types  If this is a problem take a taxi We used the metro station on Guy and also Attwater though there is a bit of a walk at both ends of your journey whichever you use  There is the superket opposite the hotel which gives you the flexibility to use the kitchenette provided in the room  We also had two enjoyable meals at the pastaria at A Ste Catherine O just a block and a half away from the hotel good value and treated like on of the family  The hotel is involved in the quota la carte expressquot scheme so food can be ordered in if that suits We slept very well rarely disturbed by others and paid for our breakfast which was   taxes  The hotel has recently added scrambled eggs and beans   didnt try those to the breakfast bar which gives it more variety but it is still not an EnglishAmerican breakfast  The only slight negative we had was the microwave smelled of popcorn TV in the room has a fair selection of FrenchEnglish language channels and a selection of movies We considered the hotel a real bargain good value for money with excellent staff and would happily return  
P => Little  outside  but definately worth it We have been at the hotel for a whole week  i want to say that i have never seen such a polite service oriented so wanting to help staff at the reception  Really  Anytime i needed them they were more then happy to help We stayed at the th floor   the view is great So as i said at the title the hotel is a little on the quotsidequot and not the center BUT rue du fort is at the corner of Rue St  Catherine and that is a major shopping and restaurant street  a  min walk on that street and you are really downtown The metro station is a  minute walk  You have a super ket right next to teh hotel a pharmacy where to do your laundry amc  movie hall and right infront of the entrance of the hotel a  hour internet coffee  Hotel has a free internet connection at the business center but it was busy most of the time i tried to be there  wireless is  a day at the hotel I had some issues with maintenance noise at  am and a maid who didnt give a damn but issues were fixed immidiately Continental breakfast is served on floor  and was quite nice and not expensive   per adult and half for a child TV in the room has a nice selection of movies to choose from should you want to All in all   I thought the hotel is truely worth its price its comforatble and excellent staff  I would come here again  
P => Great first stay in Montreal We stayed at this hotel from y       We were in town for the purposes of attending a concert LOCATION Excellent  Close to the Metro which really is the best way to get a round Montreal during the day  A little west of the hotel was a bit of a sketchy area but no one bothered us  Lots of great places to eat close by   especially recommend the Three Amigos about  blocks east of the hotel on St  Catherines  Great food great price and we love that we could go out to eat in Montreal at midnight on a Saturday night  Also loved Old Montreal  Amazing Mont Royal Park was also a must see ROOMS Huge and really reasonable  The kitchenette was great loved our view of the city from the th floor  Fireworks each night of the weekend were visible in the distance  Rooms were a bit dated in or but nothing to complain about at all  Rooms exceptionally clean and great prompt friendly housekeeping every day STAFF The front desk staff was more than willing to spend time with you to let you know what to do in Montreal and how to get around hail you a cab or whatever else you needed I really had no complaints whatsoever will stay again if in Montreal 
P => Well located comfortable hotel I stayed at the Hotel du Fort for a week whilst at a conference  The hotels location is good near the bars shops and restaurants of Rue St Catherine without being noisy  I walked to the conference centre each day an interesting  minute walk but got cabs back each night from various parts of the old town for about C tip The room was large clean and comfortable with excellent city views and powerful quiet airconditioning  Having a kitchenette in the room was great  Reception staff were helpful and efficient and managed to find me an emergency dentist Only slight gripe was having to pay C day for WiFi access I would expect this to be free in this class of hotel  
P => ent Stay A small group of friends and I stayed at the Hotel Du Fort in Montreal over Memorial Day Weekend  Check in was smooth as the front desk clerk was very polite and quick with the check in process  My initial hopes of the hotel was extremely high as the lobby seemed to have a semi  luxurious feel to it as the hotel website portrays  Unfortunately upon checking into my room my expectations of a luxurious stay were let down somewhat  The room which I believe was the next in line upgrade over a standard room was large enough in design and very clean but lacked any luxury features I expected from what the hotel website photos portrayed  My biggest let down was there was only one picture on the wall and a  s type feel to the d cor and wall paper  Fortunately after the initial let down the rest of the stay was pleasant  The hotel staff always smiled when walking by the front desk or passing in hall  and always asked if there was anything they could do for me or my friends  As for room comfort the beds were comfortable and the AC worked great  The bathroom was large enough and the shower although a bit dated was very clean and worked well  The location of the hotel could not be better as we were close to all the nightlife and restaurants of Rue Crescent and short cab ride away from Rue St Laurent  Overall if you do not expect luxury standards and value cleanliness location and friendly employees you will enjoy your stay at Hotel DuFort  
P => Front Desk Staff are the Greatest From we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel welcome and special by the front desk staff  During our stay the front desk staff were always relaxed accommodating and friendly  As I was not familiar with Montreal they gave us good tips on where to go where to eat where to shop etc  Kathleen and I particularly enjoyed the buffet breakfast as I am a picky eater  The room was huge and the bathroom clean and of the average size so it seems smaller by comparison with the huge room  
P => Hotel du Fort Satisfaction overrides Jazz Fest Dissappointment    Hotel Du Fort get a way has become an annual tradition for myself my husband my brother and his wife  Last years get a way included the Jazz Festival in early y  The Festival turned out to be more Hype than Jazz disapppointing to the most dedicated attendees  But we counted on the usual expected hospitality of the Hotel du Forte to return to each day and wake up to each morning  The restaurant served a full Breakfast Buffet each morning not stale muffins and hard bagels but fresh fruit fresh baked goods an array of breakfast foods including exceptional toasted granola yogurt and more  Tables were set with cloth napkins tablecloths and a smiling waiter or waittress to pick up empty dishes and greet each of us good morning and pour coffee  I must add that since our reserved room was not ready upon our arrival we were graciously awarded an upgrade to an exceptionally spacious suite    which enhanced our stay immeasurably  Overall I always enjoy our stay at this hotel especially since the  star accommodations are very reasonable if you dont mind a brief quotcolorfulquot walk to the downtown area or a short bus ride to the Old Town Montreal cafes Cathedrals etc  The advantage is that you can park your vehicle in the attached garage upon arrival and not get into it again until you leave Montreal  Did I also mention for cyberspace kies there is a Cyber cafe directly across the street open  hours daily Oh yes and a fully stocked local ket at the corner just in case you need something after the restaurant is closed  Hotel du Fort has become a wonderful family tradition 
P => Perfect for what we needed at the very last minute My husband received  tix to the HabsSabres game on Friday night for Saturdays game at Bel Centre Club Desjardins  They were awesome tickets So we packed up the kids and went Got to greater Montreal out by P E  Trudeau airport and started looking at our GPS lodging listings  Hotel du Fort came up I looked at the listing on Tripadvisor saw it was   of over  hotels in the area bang we chose it The front desk was helpful with recommendations about taxis vs metro vs walking bang on accurate every time  We had breakfast and parking included which was terrific  Even the parking garage was warm The room was spacious and clean  Comfortable they put us on the th floor with a great view  The only thing missing was a pool but honestly we didnt have the time to go for a swim  I asked for extra pillows and they were at my door within  minutes this at pm on Saturday night delivered with a bright smile Breakfast was quite good  No hot items on the buffet but that was okay the balance of it was very tasty the breads were terrific  Hard boiled eggs were a hit with my kids  The children were made very welcome which was nice but it wasnt a Disney esque experience  Id have been perfectly happy to go there on a quick romantic getaway with hubby All in all we were very happy to have chosen it and I would recommend it without concern  
P => Great location Stayed for  nights  Great location  Grocery store across the street metro subway  blocks away shopping on St  Catherines street around the corner  What more could you ask  The room had a queen size bed lots of space kitchenette with included fridge microwave and coffee maker  You can get cutlery from the front desk or go the the Dollarama on St Catrherines St and get plastic dishes and cutlery which we did The gym had the basic cardio machines  Went early and it was busy  Great way to work off the french pastries  Would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Just what I expected My fiance and I stayed here for  nights and it was just as everyone said in their reviews  The room was clean and spacious  The bathroom was clean and bright  We werent given a voucher for breakfast so we did pay the person charge but it was still good  Your basic bagels muffins cereals croissants and cheese  I personally think the location was great  Its right on St  Catherine where all the shops are  We basically hung out on Crescent about  blocks all weekend   we are in our late s  Parking was  a day but I felt that it was secure there  I would recommend this hotel  
P => Excellent hotel My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Du Fort for  days It was a little awkward to get to by car but thanks to GPS we had an easier time  Once you enter the hotel you quickly appreciate a well run hotel employing very capable staff  We were able to dump off our luggage and return the rental car with little difficulty The room itself was very nice quiet and included a fridge and microwave  It was well maintained  The front desk staff was very helpful with directions to the metro and recommendations for restaurants all nearby which were excellent Alpenhaus Le Paris and Au Bistro Gourmet There are all sorts of cafes drug stores and grocery stores nearby We had a great stay at Hotel Du Fort and the quality of the accommodation was a major factor  
P => Lovely Hotel and Staff Charming boutique style hotel one block off one of the major streets filled with super shopping and wonderful restaurants  My husband and I even walked to Old Montreal and back to the hotel without any problem  The hotel staff is extremely helpful and friendly  The hotel is spacious and clean and very quiet  My only recommendation is to bring your own haridryer  They do provide one but it is in an inconvenient place  Other than that the hotel is perfect  
P => Five Star Hotel for a Three Star Price We had a fabulous stay at the Hotel du Fort  The front desk staff welcomed our family and made us feel at home and the service staff was wonderful  The room was very spacious and spotless with all the amenities  The hotel is situated on a quiet street  The free internet access on the second floor was a bonus for our dhters  Great meals were to be had within easy walking distance of the hotel  An easy walk down St Catherines for lots of great shopping  We would definately stay here again  
P => Sweet Suite Deal After Best Western Europa failed to honor their price online we booked a suite using Tourisme Montreal      for  plus tax  The hotel is right on St Catherine and just Blocks away from the Bell Centre and Crescent St dining  The Metro is a  blocks away in the other direction so a car is not needed  Hotel rooms are on the th floor and up with offices in between  Our room had a great view south to the river  Parking is extra  as is the continental breakfast   There is a gym but we only stayed one night so did not try it  Ther is no restaurant in the hotel but room service will bring food from local restaurants if desired  The suite was large and comfortable with a fridge microwave and coffee maker and a sofa bed suitable for children to sleep on  We have spent much more for a room with much less in Downtown Montreal Great deal for the price  
P => Staff made things right My wife and I stayed here as a base to run in the Montreal athon  Upon arrival I was told that the room type I reserved I had the confirmation in hand was no longer available  I could settle for a smaller bed or a smoking room  I pointed out that it was  minutes after the listed check in time and doubted that everyone else had checked in before me  I insisted on the room type I reserved or a refund to the price of the lesser room I was provided my parking voucher included in the price of the room I booked and asked to check at the desk once I parked my car  The desk clerk apologized for the inconvenience and provided me with a key to a no additional cost upgrade suite The hotel isnt fancy but it is quiet CLEAN and had a very friendly staff  They made their error right and offered an apology  We found the walk to Crescent Street to be easy and refreshing  No worries about safety and had the weather turned bad the metro was only a block and a half Overall this was a pleasant experience and I would definitely stay here again  
P => Large room good location good price Stayed  nights at this hotel Room was large comfortable and clean with a killer downtown view  Room was a bit dated and was surprised hotel was only  years old Location was good with plenty of restaurants cafes and bars nearby  Would recommend LParis on Catherine and for cheap eat of rosterrie chicken would recommend Scores further along To get to Old Town was a  min walk and to walking along Catherine beside the hotel for  mins will bring you to start of shopping area  Latin Quarter is   min walk  Overall a good stay and would recommend  Montreal is a great city very lively  Best city in Canada imo  
P => tidy but not fancy I stayed at the last  weekends of ust  It is clean and tidy but not elegant  The facilities are minimal  Actually it is at the upper floors of a hotelschool complex  It locates at the west end of the busy district  Subway to go downtown is close by but you need to good through a tunnel which is slightly smelly and somebody sleeps there at night  Taxi to go downtown is around  If you choose the signature room it is pretty spacious with a queen and sofa beds almost at the same price  Some rooms have a pretty good view of downtown  If you book through AAACAA it costs you a premium but includes parking and breakfast  Depending on the number of occupants it  worth it You need to register in the hotel before you can go to the building parking  However there is no parking space in front of the hotel  
P => Great Stay good price My family and I booked this last minute  The hotel is downtown but a little far from the hustle and bustle of the main St  Catherines area  Its about a  minuite walk  Too far though to walk to Vieux Montreal  but most downtown hotels are  Unfortunately the metro was closed because of repairs so we had to use the Georges Vanier station vs  Atwater or Guy  Which turned out to be more convenient going to Old Montreal  The hotel itself isnt spectacular but nothing bad at all except it doesnt have a restaurant but has a breakfast and lounge area  The service was good housekeeping was a little slow There is a good Persian restaurant two blocks east on St  Catherines across from the drug t  There is also a small shopping centre at the corner of Atwater and St  Catherines  about  blocks west of the hotel  As well there is a nice small area a   min  walk west on St  Catherines past Atwater north on Greene  in westmount  If you walk south on rue du Fort and across from the Canadian Center for Architecture there is a sculpture park with a nice view of south Montreal  Lastly before booking your hotel room with any online site like expedia call the hotel and ask the price for a room it  turn out to be cheaper ask if you can get breakfast or parking for free  Remember to be careful the area  as most of downtown Montreal can get slightly rough  
P => Pleasant for the price My friend and I stayed at the Hotel du Fort for  nights during the week Tues Friday  For the price the AAA rate   which included parking AND breakfast it was well worth the stay  The room was clean the hotel is in a ent location and every single person on the staff was friendly Never having traveled to Montreal it was a shot in the dark   but an excellent choice Its only a few short blocks from Cresent St  which has many restaurants to choose from  There are also many places to eat on St  Catherine so one never goes hungry Its also only a few blocks from the subway  It seems to be a more business oriented hotel so we found it nice and quiet at night and not terribly busy  I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others  
P => Good Hotel Stayed here for  nights with my  young children and husband  Our overall experience with the hotel was excellent  The staff were very pleasant and helpful and EVERYONE including housekeeping spoke English  The room ours was a prestige suite was spacious clean and neutral and we had a lovely view  The kitchenette area had plates etc  which was perfect to fix breakfast or a snack for the kids  I brought a couple bags of microwave pop corn which held them over before a later dinner  The only issue was the location  Yes it is conveniant  You can walk to many places but the neighbourhood is a little seedy  Also the parking lot is designed for small cars so be careful if you go in a full sized SUV  The breakfast was well priced at a promo price of  but at the regular price it isnt  
P => Not a restful stay Yes it is a nice hotel in the western fringe of downtown Montreal  The room is UNusually big but the bathroom is comparatively small with very little space to put toiletries on  As a whole it is nicely orated and the complimentary breakfast was very good What bothered me is that they put us up on the th floor next to the exercise room  At  oclock in the morning we were wakened by a thumping sound that continued unabated  We thought somebody broke the rule by using the exercise room too early  I went out to take a look and to my surprise on the door the sign read quotopening hours am to pmquot  At the time of reservation I had specfied a quiet room  How can they put us up in such a room which is subject to noise in the early and late hours I complained to the manager and no apology was given  All he said quotThey shouldnt have given you this room  Please do me a favour  Fill out a comment form as you check outquot  Obviously tired and stressed out  the day in Montreal was somewhat spoiled as we headed to Quebec city that evening We used the parking garage next door  It wasnt cheap  a day  It annoyed me a great deal because the garage door opened a mere few seconds after inserting the parkcard  By the time I pulled the card out put the car in gear to drive in the door closed down on me  I had to try several times before I made it through  When exiting the garage I didnt know I had to insert the parkcard in again and the door refused to open  
P => A Nice Hotel The parking garage was clean safe and very easily accesible from the hotel  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The room was large clean and comfortable with a nice view of the city and the Mont Royal  The hotel is very close to two metro stations so getting around is easy  Its also close to the highway so we didnt have to drive in downtown Montreal for very long  Skip the breakfast weve had much better free continental breakfasts at the Hampton and riott  This breakfast isnt worth the money  
P => Absolutely lovely I stayed at the Hotel du Fort for a weekend break during a business trip to Southern Ontario in ober  What a little gem of a hotel Staff were wonderful during my very late check in dealing with me very professionally while at the same time gently chasing away a rather inebriated young woman who had followed a young man back to the hotel     grin The room was wonderfully comfortable and the tiny kitchenette was perfect for some snacks amp bevs picked up at the nearby Provigo The continental breakfast included in my room rate was excellent but would not have been worth the quoted price  The little raisin rolls were very good though so be    Staff were professional and attentive and happily switched between French and English without hesitation great for this unfortunately unilingual western Canadian Id happily stay there again and in fact hope to sneak away from another business trip this fall for a weekend in Montreal at the Hotel du Fort 
P => Nice price and location The Hotel du Fort has a nice location in downtown Montreal  The hotel is clean well staffed and overall a solid choice in the area  The rooms were nice and modern but felt like a hotel  Although there are no real bells and whistles at this hotel I really appreciated that   it allowed my husband and I to use it as a hotel and get out and explore the city  A tip Definitely check the hotels website   I found a much better price there than at the travel websites e g  Orbitz  
P => Excellent Service I was very impressed during my stay at Hotel du Fort   the staff were extremely professional helpful and very friendly  The rooms were clean comfortable and spacious  The location is very convenient   near the metro grocery stores    The staff were awesome and calls and requests to the front desk were answered promptly and quickly ie requesting cutlery  The rooms have a kitchenette which is really handy to have  There are some great features like a large screen TV in the common area where breakfast is served as well as a couch and a library  The continental breakfast was quite ent as well  For a picky traveller must say that I was very pleased with my stay at Hotel du Fort   I felt so well taken care of I almost didnt want to go home I would highly recommend Hotel du Fort to anyone looking for a place to stay in downtown Montreal  
P => Would be a great hotel at twice the price Even after reading the positive reviews the Hotel Du Fort exceeded my expectations  This hotel is a find   great location spacious and nicely done rooms good breakfast and professional friendly accommodating staff   all at more than reasonable rates The only strange thing was that with the way the room was set up you couldnt watch the TV from the sitting area only from the bed  Not a big deal I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone  
P => Nice hotel in a great location We stayed at Hotel Du Fort from      We had a large clean corner room on the th floor  It had a kitchenette a sitting area and a king size bed  Since it was a corner it had  large windows on two sides  It was a non smoking room but someone definitley smoked in there at some point  Musty smoke odor but not that bad  Location is great It is right on St Catherine St so it is never far to a bar or restuarant  Cresent St is only about   blocks away  The hotel staff is very nice and helpful Parking is expensive at about  a day Canadian 
P => Great deal great stay great hotel We booked a room with king size bed and when we got there they bumped us to an executive suite for only and extra  Suite had  rooms with private hallway kitchenette with small fridge plates glasses etc  all spotless  Had plama tv and couch in one room and another tv in the other although couldnt figure out how to turn it on   but we could have called  Bed sheets spotless and great reallyyy comfortable bed  Bathroom clean too Great size room   all for about  US dollars  Parking in underground safe garage cost about  Canadian dollars  Concierge helpful and friendly Near Catherine Street and about  minute drive from Old Montreal  Would definitely go again  
P => An affordable oasis in the city We ided to stay at the Hotel Du Fort after many positive reviews here on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed It is located on Saint Catherine St  which is the main downtown drag  You have access to a multitude of grocery stores and restaurants all within walking distance  If you plan on taking the Metro which we recommend instead of driving you are located between Atwater and Guy Concordia station  Each are about a   min walk away The staff was very professional and we were even able to check in early  The front desk staff and concierge gave us a lot of great info about restaurants and must sees in Montreal  On departure they stored our luggage and called us a taxi ahead of time so we would not have to wait  The rooms are spacious and very clean with a small kitchentte and fridge  The beds were very comfortable and we did not have one complaint about our room  Overall it was a wonderful experience that we would gladly repeat  If youre looking for clean comfortable accomodations located in downtown Montreal that is reasonably priced do not hesitate to stay here 
P => Surprised By All the Glowing Reviews Having read many glowing reviews about Hotel du Fort I was feeling pretty good about my stay  The hotel was just OK ProsClose to the Guy Concordia stop on the MetroStones throw from Rue Ste  CatherineSuperket Provigo across the street and another ket  block awayPrice  USDnight through ExpediaConsThe room drab tired musty smell dustyApparently this hotel is popular with tour groups that cater to teens and  somethings  It felt like I was the only person on my floor not affiliated with this particular group  The floor sounded like a college dorm even at  AM  One of the staff was telling me that this particular group was one of the better ones  Yikes 
P => Hotel Du Fort was toatlly worth it Hotel Du Fort was great it was very centrally located and  blocks from the train station and around the corner from Rue ste catherine which has bars clubs restaurants everything  Taxis are easily accessible and the hotel staff are super helpful with directions calling taxis and general information  
P => Amazing I found this Hotel by complate chance  As soon as I visited their website I was hooked Being a frist time solo traveler i am only    I was nervous at how the hotel staff was going to respind to me and my boyfriend and our  guy friends staying there  The second that we stepped out of the cabs the staff was so helpful  Eveytime we walked through the lobby the Concierge were always there to point us in the right direction  We only experianced one problem  For the first night we were put in the wrong room  But as soon as I relized the mistake the staff took care of it and we were in out new room very quickly Overall I would recomend this Hotel to anyone  It is in an ideal spot for tourists just a few blocks away from shopping bars and clubs  And only a short cab ride away from old Montreal 
P => Great hotel great staff great location I have just returned from a weekend holiday at the Hotel Du Fort  The hotel is great and has such good service  We stayed on the th floor with its own ice and pop machines and one floor above the gym and snack machine  I wasnt sure just what to expect at breakfast but it was a lovely continental spread with cheeses pastries etc  The staff were very knowledgeable and gave great dinner suggestions  They also had maps and the official tourist guide for Montreal all of which was very helpful in planning the day  Check out was at noon but had a cab come to meet us at the hotel at  as we had to be at the airport for pm  They stored our baggage for us while we walked along St  Catherines St  one last time before going home  All in all the Du Fort is great and I would not hesitate to stay there again  
P => great location We stayed at the Hotel du Fort for  nights in tember  and had a great time  The staff was friendly the room was clean and what I liked the most was to have my own make up mirror  We were on the th floor therefore the view was absolutely wonderful at night  The kitchenette is small but cozy  The room is a good size  My only complaint would be that the bed is a bit to hard for my liking  The location is great because youre close to the boutiques and restaurants  I would definitely stay there again  
P => Hotel Du Fort   GREAT PLACE TO STAY  Just got back from staying at the Hotel Du Fort  WE HAD THE BEST TIME  The hotel was clean  hotel staff very nice  We are going to make this a yearly trip now  The location couldnt be better  It is located in the middle of  metros  all within a few blocks  You can be in Old Montreal via metro in   minutes at the most  We used the metros every day    traveled everywhere in Montreal   saw everything   and had a great time  Eat late   this is the city that never sleeps   seriously If you love beer and food    Montreal is the place to go  Also visit the Cock N Bull Pub  local bands play on Thursday and Friday nights  located on St  Catherine  Best place to eat is Cine Express   about  block on St  Catherine  Grocery store has everything you will need for breakfast etc     However Cine Express is very cheap    huge portions and great food   serves breakfast  stays open until   am Cant wait to go back  Have fun  we did  
P => Du Fort a comfortable and convenient hotel My wife and I had a delightful stay here for  nights in early tember  Hotel staff is friendly and helpful with directions reservations and booking tours  Parking is underneath hotel arate charge of  or so per night  Expect to carry your own bags carts are available  The room was C per night plus   taxes  Our room was clean quiet and comfortable with the bathroom and closet a little on the small side  Flat screen TV was in good working order with the usual selection of recent pay per view films  C  There is no restaurant but a buffet breakfast is available each morning  We passed on this since our room had a mini kitchen with microwave sink coffeemaker and dishes and silverware  There is a well stocked grocery store almost across the street  Also there is a newstand and a breakfastlunch place in the building that is not a part of the hotel  Location is great on the west side of town just off one of the main eastwest streets St  Catherine  Restaurants bistros Iranian Japanese etc  groceries post office stores a movie megaplex are all within easy walking distance less than  blocks  There are a lot of colleges and technical schools in the area so there are lots of students thronging the streets  The retail is mixed not the high end but neighborhood is very safe to walk around in during the day or evening  Metro green line is about  blocks in either direction  Would we stay there againrecommend to others Definitely yes  
P => Loved It I booked this hotel through their website after checking Tripadvisor of course  They offered a AAA rate of  CA which included parking per day and continental breakfast    What a pleasant surprise The hotel was clean the room large and had a small compact kitchen which came in handy for dinner leftovers  The staff was friendly and very helpful  Location was great   we parked the car in the hotel lot and never moved it  The Atwater Metro was a few blocks in one direction and the Guy Concordia Metro a few blocks in another direction  The hotel is half a block from St  Catherines Street   the main drag through Montreal  We walked or took Metro everywhere we wanted to go with no problems whatsoever  Many ethnic restaurants and cafes well within walking distance  At no time did we feel threatened walking the streets no matter what time it was  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Spacious rooms good deal First a word of caution  If you happen to be arriving on Canada Day y  note that Montreals Canada Day parade starts on du Fort street  You  be delayed in drivingparking until later in the afternoon  No worries though as the rest of our stay was excellent  Very large spacious rooms  The appointments in the room were above average if not unspectacular  Nice flat screen tvs  Small lobby helpful staff  Well within walking distance of Metro stops and many downtown spots  
P => off the beaten track good value My family of two adults and two teens booked this hotel through their website  We arrived after  pm  I was pleasantly surprised  Clean and very quiet in an urban neighborhood  Not a tourist area  The breakfast at the du Fort was too expensive for four  Convenient   Post office grocery stores and internet cafe across the street  Little fridge and microwave in the room  Walk to transportation walk to car rental shops and restaurants  We really liked the ethnic dining options nearby  I found the desk staff very helpful in contrast to some other reviewers  Always call to re confirm and get the managers name  
P => Budget not Boutique I travel to Montreal regularly on business and thought I would give it a try since they were offering pretty reasonable rates  This is a hotel catering to the budget tourist or anyone else looking for an inexpensive stay downtown ProsReasonable rates Spacious and well equipped rooms with safe windows you can open and a kitchenetteConsOdd ball location in Concordia University ghettoOnly two elevatorsInsufficient and indifferent staffBland room designsSmall bathroomsNot particularly cleanSimilar hotels in the downtown include the riott ResidenceLe Cantile Suites and the Phillips Square  Of these the Phillips Square gets my vote  
P => Excellent Hotel I originally stayed at the Hotel Du Fort in Montreal about  years ago yet my recollection of the quality of the hotel was vague  For whatever reason I ided to stay there on our most recent trip to Montreal just to try something new     and I was blown away with the curteous staff the quality of the room the overall cleanliness of the lobby and our room and most of all the value for our money  ie   per night in the heart of downtown Montreal  The location is ideal     park your car and leave it     everything is accessible either by foot inexpensive taxi or subway    Every aspect of our stay at Hotel Du Fort was positive     Ive now switched allegiances from my former quotregularquot hotel accommodations in Montreal  
P => Great location Dont let the austere and rather bland facade fool you this is an understated but elegant hotel located right downtown You would never guess this hotel used to be an office building   there is much warmth and charm offered in the cozy attractive and exceptionallty clean rooms that offer great views of the cityMy husband and I stayed here recently and I really loved this hotel not only for its ambience but for its GREAT DOWNTOWN LOCATION  Not only are you just a few blocks away from the metro subway but you are also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants that offer a variety of cuisine from Thai to Italian to Indian Schezwan Mexican French   and so much more Most rooms are equipped with a small kitchenette mini fridge and microwave and although breakfast is included in the guest lounge nd floor there is a very excellent grocery store Provigo located just around the corner from the hotel on Ste Catherine St  which is open until AM  On the opposite corner is a major post office so convenient for mailing those postcards and gifts to the folks back home   and if you are travelling with a laptop high speed internet access is only  Cdn for hr access  Left your laptop at home Not to worry because there is an internet cafe right across the street from the hotel it is called quotBattle Netquot if I remember correctly Unique QualitiesThere is no pool but the hotel has recently added a small gym and excercise room but I havent had to opportunity to check it out  They also have excellent conference facilities and a small buffet breakfast lounge area  The buffet breakfast is nothing fancy   your typical juices fresh fruit cereals hot and cold croissants bagels toast muffins tea and coffee  The croissants are outstanding  And all layed out in a very attractive and quiet setting  The wide screen TV is set to CNN and local news but it is set back in a corner of the room and not so blaringly loud as to disturb those who enjoy a quiet breakfast  Newspapers both local and the New York Times are complimentary also The views of the Montreal skyline at night and the mighty Saint Lawrence river in the background are well worth the rates alone Speaking of rates they are fairly reasonable compared to the other downtown hotels in the area  We paid   Cdn a nightper room during a weekend stay ch  in a standard room breakfast included My only complaint about this hotel is the rather plain bathrooms with standard size bathtubs  Theyre Ok I guess   pretty much what youd expect of any standard hotel bathroom   but I love a good soak at the end of the day in a big whirlpooljacuzzi type bathtub and its a shame more hotels dont offer this feature Still in my opinion   definately worth the money in comparison to other hotels in this area Hotel web site www hoteldufort com 
P => Great value  This hotel is a great value  My wife and I spent there to nights the room was very big and very clan  The bathroom was huge and the room had an impressive view over Montreal downtown  
P => Will recommend Hotel du Fort and return Had a great stay at the Hotel du Fort  Its in the middle of a busy lively part of the city where people live and work  Our best meals in Montreal were within easy walking distance of the hotel Le Paris and Bistro Gourmet  both great food and friendly service  Good access to the Metro to get everywhere although walking distances arent that bad with good sightseeing along the way  We had very good service from the hotel staff thought our room was attractive and comfortable and found the continental breakfast very good although chocolate stuffed croissants didnt help my weight 
P => Disappointing We arrived at pm to check in and both receptionists were on the phone taking reservations  After close to a  minute wait one finished and started to check us in with no apology for the long wait but then the phone rang and she left us there waiting while she took another reservation We had booked a king deluxe suite with sleeper sofa because we were a party of   adults and  child  However the room was stocked with  bath towels and there was no bedding for the sofa bed  We also had to call the front desk to get a light bulb replaced because the one in the lamp was burned out We did however have a good lh at the parking garage  Its located next door to the hotel and is closed at night except for hotel guests who must swipe their pass at the cardreader for the gate to go up  The funny part is that the cardreader is located so close to the gate that there isn t space to drive all the way up and roll down your window to swipe the card  You have to stop your car before you get to the machine get out of the car and swipe the card  But do it quickly because the gate only gives you a couple of seconds to go through before it shuts again  We felt like we were on Candid Camera  
P => Great Value Location Hotel du fort was a great value in montreal during the jazz festival  The hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable  Our room was sufficient for two people and liked having a hidden kitchenette  It was a bit noisy having a room near the elevator and vending machine though  Hotel was close to  subway stops which we used constantly and felt very safe walking at night  While the hotel is kind of on the edge of downtown we found the location great and quiet and walkable to restaurants shops and public transportation bus and subway  I would stay here again  
P => Great Hotel  Great Location I have a son who is a student at McGill University in Montreal  We live about  hours away and we try to get up to visit him fairly often  In the course of our visits weve stayed a number of places in the city and Hotel Du Fort is truly my favorite There is really nothing not to like about this hotel  Parking is right below in an excellent parking garage  The staff is courteous and friendly  The lobby is small clean and very nicely appointed feels like a smaller European hotel  The elevators are fast and clean a big plus compared to some of the bigger hotels in town where you  wait  minutes for the lift  The rooms are really lovely and spacious  I think the place must have been reated fairly recently because absolutely nothing feels even the tiniest bit frayed worn grimy or tired  The beds are among the best hotel beds Ive slept in and the bathrooms are clean bright and have have very high grade fixtures Breakfast though not cooked is done very well offering much more than just cereals also has boiled eggs ham platter cheese platter fruits juices toast pastries etc  The internet cafe across the street is extremely handy as is the fact that there are two grocery stores located less than a block from the hotel The location is nice though it is a bit west of most of the things we usually end up doing in the city as in a few blocks west  But again its certainly a very nice area with perfectly good access to everything via the Metro  Finally the hotel is priced very reasonably and you get a whole lot of value for your money Ive stayed at the hotel a number of times and have recommended it to a number of friends  If you are looking for a smaller reasonably priced clean and comfortable hotel in downtown Montreal you really cant do better than this  
P => The velous heart of Montreal Our two month journey found us spending eight leisure days in Montreal the last week of ober   The Hotel du Fort afforded us that extra level of comfort we seek when traveling for months  We enjoyed a large very clean and meticulously furnished Superior Studio  Front desk people bent over backwards to offer every type of help from sightseeing to neighborhoods recommendation  buffet breakfast is DELUXE Continental as pictured on the hotels web site  The breakfast room with large projection TV free newspapers etc  verges on opulent  Great way to start the day  As noted on the web site the studio has a partition with king bed on one side and sofaclub chair on the other Their comfort corner is a mini kitchen with frig and microwave  We requested a no charge hot plate and set of dishes and utensils for the week  We were not driving and I recall the hotels parking fee is on the high side Location is fantastic only a couple of blocks to the subway and all sorts of shops stores kets within a block  Pepsi forum with super multiplex is just three blocks away All in all super comfort and convenience for a very reasonable price  
P => Nice Suprise At first glimse I thought I had made a poor choice  However once inside the hotel I found it to be an excellent choice  It was reated a few years ago and now has large rooms a kitchenette behind louvred doors nice bathrooms and an very expansive continental breakfast on the nd floor Dining Room  The hotel is spotless throughout  The staff was courteous well informed and extremely helpful  I was first given an end room but it had had a smoker in it and I was then given a room which was larger than the first room  The Hotel is a few blocks from the fashion district of St  Catharines St  and  minutes walk to Sherbrooke art musuems and Crescent Street  It is not luxurious but the rooms are very nice  I would recommend it  I also lucked out on the rate from Quebec Tourisim  
P => You can o better My boyfriend and I just stayed here ober   and we were quite disappointed  We stayed in a standard room supposedly non smoking that definitely smelled like smoke  Also the elevators were having problems and when I called the front desk to ask if we could take the stairs we were on the th floor I was told no they are for emergency use only we had to wait for the elevator and then I was asked quotWhy are you in a hurryquot We were in fact on vacation and trying to get to a museum before closing  The room was fine and very basic but for the price you can do better  
P => Nice Place

P => outdated yet cosy My boyfriend and I wanted a place to stay for a mere two nights  Hotel du Manoir was a good value  The place is likened to an old fashioned wood chalet  The room and bathroom were relatively clean and some basic toiletries were included  The staff were friendly and pleasant  The hotel was well located in the heart of the city provided that you are not phased by panhandlers and the homeless that are omnipresent in this area  If youre looking for a no frills accommodation in the thick of the city I would recommend this place  
P => Great place to party for the weekend I booked this hotel on Booking com and it was perfect for what I was looking for  I stayed there one night went to the clubs the casino  It was right next to the club area and the drive to the casino was quick and easy  
P => I love this place Ive stayed at the Hotel du Manoir about half a dozen times over the past eight years and I think it offers a superb value for the price  It is not a five star hotel but the rooms are clean and comfy with high ceilings and spotless bathrooms  There are many conveniences that are great if youre on a budget A little fridge in each room telephone with free local calls free Internet access in the lobby and a free continental breakfast er which Ive never woken up early enough to try  The location is fabulous right in the lively Latin Quarter with wonderful little import shops and tons of coffee shops and restaurants  And let me add that its a perfect location for vegetarians with two amazing vegetarian restaurants nearby    Le Commensal practically next door and Yuan about a block away  From the Latin Quarter you can easily walk to various other parts of Montreal such as downtown Old Montreal Chinatown etc  Although the neighborhood is lively Ive never had a problem with noise at night  The rooms seem pretty sound proof And last but not least the manager at the front desk is exceptionally kind and helpful with a wonderful sense of humor 
P => honest review I took a chance with this hotel because half of the reviews on this site were positive and half were negative  Im here to set the record straight  This is not a one star hotel it is a zero star hotel  The location is on the busy St  Denis which would be fine if it were not for the local bum population thats parked right outside your front door step  Upon checking in it was obvious that this hotel was not up to par  The carpeted and cramped stairway featured a large stain near the top where someone had apparently vomitted  The rooms were cramped and haphazardly arranged  At the foot of my bed was our only sink  The toliet and shower were in erate rooms the shower boasting a soft floor for which I prayed I wouldnt fall through  The bed linens were not sufficently clean  The air conditioning was ill suited to handle the cooling of the room  Overall I would never recommend such a hotel to anyone  This hotel is better suited to be a brothel than a place that accomodates tourists in Montreal  
P => Bedbugs   never again As I woke up at  am in the morning I saw two bedbugs on my pillow   I left the hotel inmediately  I put everything in garbage bags and then threw everything away my bag jeans socks underwear running shoes and a  Ralph Lauren jacket I used as a pillow  Clerk said they would close the room   well these nasty insects move from room to room I changed clothes three times before coming home and I threw away those clothes as well I sprayed poison on my car apartment take my advise be very very very careful if staying   this place or youll have a surprise when you get home 
P => Great value  location This hotel is a gem of a deal  Its cheap clean great location  friendly staff  This was my first visit to Montreal and I didnt know my way around  The hotel is located in the Latin quarter  The neighborhood is a rustic chic trendy area  Affordable dining and cool bars  Excellent Thai restaurant and a hookah bar nearby  Our stay was very pleasant and exceeded my expectations  I thought the place would be somewhat rundown considering the low room rates but it wasnt  It was well maintained and had the feeling of a European hostel  I highly reccomend it  
P => Good Value I stayed at Hotel Du Manoir St  Denis in Montreal for  night and felt that it was good value for  including tax  There were  of us  guys and  girl  Booking  rooms at a regular hotel or  large roomsuite would have been expensive and awkward so staying at Du Manoir was the best solution for us  The guys stayed in a double room with  double beds for  including tax and I had the single room with a double bed  The rooms were basic but clean and they even each had a fridge and TV What more could you ask for The concierge was very friendly  It was centrally located too at St  Denis and Ontario walkable to many restaurants and bars  The only drawback are the thin walls  You can hear your next door neighbour easily  We were there il th so the hotel was not full and all we heard were each other but during high season I imagine would get noisy  
P => What a GEM I have stayed here more than  nights over the past few years  The rooms are cabin nottypine clean and comfortable  The staff is excellent Friendly and so Accommodating In addition to a great value their location is ideal  Park your car and DO Montreal by foot  Close to metro too  Well be there again in a few weeks and wouldnt think of ever staying anywhere else  Its not the Ritz  We stay at too many four and five star hotelsresorts during any one year so its a fefreshing change to stay at such a home y place when we go to Montreal  
P => sympatique  
P => Le confort et la propret    petit prix  
P => 
P => Not recommended We spent  days and  night it is one of the worst hotel where I have been the receptionist was so bad he doesnt care about the customers be they dont know what is the customers satisfaction the room is too small the bath room also is not enough for even  person I am so upset because of the receptionist attitude that i hated the hotel  
P => Sketchy I stayed here for five nights il   il    Four of us had two rooms  In both rooms rooms the tv remotes didnt work and the staff didnt seem to care one tv only had  channels the other tv had a nice few  You almost have to stand on the tiolett to close the bathroom door shower has barely enough room to turn around  rooms very dusty with spider webs in corners no ice machine or AC and pretty much no lobby  Besides not caring about the remotes most staff were friendly in giving info about the city and the location is great  Good spot to stay for a bunch of guys out for an event at the bell center or to party DEFINETLY not a place to take your wife or family  
P => beware To everybody B E W A R E of this Hotel du Nouveau Forum Montreal  This place is not the place for you guys to bookcheck in or stay  The receptionist is not so very helpful  the chinese guy with a long hair  the rooms so very very small and the washroom so tiny not so spacious and it needs to share to the other room next to you  About the floor carpet dusty dirty and so cleaned the same also with the bedsheet so smelly  This place is disgusting and very uncomfortable to stay   B E W A R E  
P => Good Location for the Hockey Traveler Not a bad hotel for the price  Room was small but quaint  TV remote control didnt work  Breakfast is Bread and coffee or juice only  
P => Never again Will never stay there again  Rooms are dirty  Forget about quotensuitequot bathrooms   although repainted they stink and the paint is peeling off  Sink full of rust  Breakfast tables are dirty you need a paper towel to wipe them off first  Parking is included walking distance to downtown probably the only good thing  Will never stay at this place again  
P => CHEAP AND CLOSE TO EVERYTHING I stayed there  times   once for new years in  and then  weekend last year   if ur a teenager and dont want to spend a lot of money on a hotel i highly recommend this  rooms are tiny and feel crowded  and washrooms are tinnnnnnnnnnyyy  but if ur not planning on staying in the hotel long and are just using it to sleep then book this  cheapest place in downtown montreal  and literally a  min walk to clubs and party scene Two of my friends got bug bites   thats the only problem and theres no kicthen or anything   and security wise anyone can basically walk in and out  good for sneaking in  but not good for rapists and such  friendly staff   and never got noise complaints   basically threw a party in the hallway on the rd floor and did beer bongs and no one came up stairs  
P => Had  great stays there Im surprised to read many bad reviews of this place  Ive stayed there twice when I used to live in Quebec City and had to sleep in Mtl  Both times I was very satisfied First the rates are very cheap for a place this close to Downtown  Especially convenient if you attend a show or a hockey game at the Bell Centre right accross the street The staff was real friendly and helpful  The rooms were a bit small but very clean including the bathroom  Beds were confortable TV worked fine Breakfast was excellent  I remember having a pleasant conversation with the employee on duty  She was real friendly asking what I was in town for if I slept well even though they had many guest that night who attended the Motley Crue show   Fact is I slept perfectly didnt really hear any noise The only thing I can think of is that this place went suddenly through a downward spiral in  years  Thatd be sad because it had a great value for the price  
P => The second worst hotel in the world We booked two rooms for the victoria day holiday in  I couldnt wait to get out of there  There were a few things that made this place intollerable  There were stains on the toilet seat i tried to wipe them off with a tissue it didnt work  It was the first hotel that I actually had to pad the toilet sit   Extremely smelly AC   although it was extremely hot and the window in the room didnt open we had to turn the AC off   quotContinental breakfastquot   I think these people read about hotels in some magazine  Their idea of continental breakfast is an extremely stale microwave heated croissante limited one per person   The shower was not in the same room as the toilet  The shower is just a nook in the wall right beside the front door so when you enter your room you see a shower curtain on your left no door Just dont go there  
P => shameful sux horrible and WOW for the continental breakfest pfff add  n you can get a nicest hotel trust me    
P => ent hotel for a great price Hotel du Nouveau Forum is a good hotel for a great price  It is very basic but that is fine with me since I dont spend much time in my hotel when on vacation  The rooms were basic clean and a ent size and the hotel was quiet  Free continental breakfast coffe tea juice toast croissants are included and for  more you can order bagels or cereal  Staff is very friendly and helpful  The area isnt the prettiest near a parking lot and the entrance to the highway but it is safe and close to lots of activities  It is within walking distance to downtown  If you like to walk it is about   minutes to Old Montreal  Or you can take the metro the nearest station is just a block away  If you are looking for a hotel with lots of amenities and with great views this is not the hotel for you  But if you are looking for a safe clean place at a bargain price check out the Hotel du Nouveau Forum  
P => Good price but is it worth it  The hotel is quite small and the rooms are even smaller  There is just room for the bed and that is it  We stayed at the hotel because it was a great price and the location is excellent  second walk to the Bell Centre  However I would not stay there again  The service is horrendous  The maid did not clean our room because we did not leave a tip in advance  The quotcontinental breakfastquot consists of toasts and butter  The rooms are quite dirty and it was a rather scary experience  My word of advice is spend a little more and stay somewhere else it will be worth it  
P => Muy bueno se esperaba peor  
P => Aurait besoin d tre r    
P => bon rapport qualit  prix

P => Balcony   two thumbs up Hotel Elegant gave me a TV brand new bar fridge clean room clean corridors no smoke smell balcony parking on premise  AND a cute concierge lady  Not to mention that it is in a great spot if you want to get around  A short walk   minutes from quotMontrealquot night life and short drive   minutes from Old Montreal   which is beautiful by the way   the location of the hotel is in a great spot  We slept like babies  What else can I say Im happy with Hotel Elegant  
P => What a dump  Firstly I am easy to please so dont get the idea I am a complainer  This joint is a dump  You can see through the towels  There is nowhere to put your bags  Breakfast is a cold croissant or a muffin only one per guest  The streets surrounding are full of beggars  On the up side though you can walk to the corner and get on the metro to the city  
P => fine for the money I just came back from Montreal  I was there for business but extended my trip to enjoy the city for few extra days  I stayed at hotel elegant  I was a little disappointed when I arrived as it wasnt very solubrious  However the rooms were clean and attebded every day and the location was good too  Just across the road from Metro and bus station so was convenient for getting around  Also right in middle of the action for Just for Lhs festival which was on while I was there  Overall good value for money but if you want something a bit special try elsewhere 
P => Dont be fooled by the pictures of this hotel on their website This place sucks   big time The fact that you had to be buzzed into the hotel before you could enter it says a little about the clientele and the neighbourhood that this hotel caters to  As soon as we pulled up outside of quotHotelquot quotElegantquot two words that should never be used together in the same sentence to describe this place and I saw two shirtless frat boys lounging on their room balcony swilling beer I knew that I wouldnt enjoy my stay in this illustrious establishment  Theres a smell throughout the place that while not exactly stinky wasnt very pleasant either  I couldnt put my finger on it  It reminded me of industrial strength disinfectant with a cheap scent added to mask the smell  It was most obvious in the hallway elevator and lobby but was noticeable in the rooms too  They insinuated that theres a microwave available to guests but what they leave out is that its ONE microwave in the kitchenbreakfast room area which could barely fit four cafe tables for   And forget about that quotfree continental breakfastquot that they offer  it consists of assorted muffins and croissants from Costco and are stored in the fridge  As other reviewers have commented the neighbourhood is dodgy the rooms are small the washrooms are dirty the dirt in our bathtub looked like actual dirt   as in people showered with their shoes on  Which is exactly what I did as well the beds are hard and the pillows are deflated our room had a lovely view of the parking lot in the back along with run down houses in various stages of disrepair to access the parking lot in the back without having to go around the block you have to walk through the back hallway which is lined with trash bags that have been sitting there since who knows when  There was a dirty oscillating fan sitting in the middle of our air conditioned room which we tried using but it was still too hot so we finally called downstairs to the receptionist I refuse to call her a concierge to ask why it was so hot when its supposedly an air conditioned room  It turns out that the place has central air conditioning and you have no control over how cold you want to make your room  I also strongly suspect that they didnt change the sheets from the last guest so I just lay my jacket down over the pillows and hoped for the best  And while there were no bed bugs feasting on me by the time I woke up in the morning I certainly fell asleep worrying about that possibility  I could go on and on about this jewel of a hotel but I think you get the picture  Our room was  a night and that was about  too much  For another  extra we couldve stayed at a Best Western  Whats  compared to a good nights sleep 
P => Never Book This Hotel Hotel Elegant is hands down THE worst hotel in all of Canada  It is an absolutely revolting establishment with no regard for its customers  I had the worst stay Ive ever had anywhere  Firstly when we arrived we found that you have to buzz to get into the hotel and were subsequently locked outside in the cold for over twenty minutes  The excuse for this was that the receptionist couldnt hear us buzzing knocking calling or yelling  Then there were Hotel Elegants rules which include no visitors after  pm no alcohol and no outside food  This place is more like your mother in laws than a hotel  The rooms themselves are even worse  There are stains literally everywhere and in four days of stay our sheets and towels were never changed once  And the free highspeed wireless internet they advertise It requires an ethernet cord  Dont bother waking up for the continental breakfast either  Its quite literally canned orange juice muffins from the grocery and cheap tea  All of which is quite obviously bought weeks in advance and tastes incredibly stale The staff is what tops this place off  They all act extremely snobbish and turn any small complaint you make into a lecture on how you should be glad the hotel is so cheap  And by the way their prices fluctuate on how much they want to extort you as we discovered when a friend came to get a room for the night and got the exact same room we booked for twenty dollars lessLastly and this really takes the cake on our last nights stay we found a pair of dirty red boxershorts underneath one of our beds  These shorts did not belong to any of us If I were you Id take my money and go down the street to the Comfort Inn where it might be a tiny bit more expensive but at least your sheets are clean  
P => Basic Clean Quiet Cheap Room I stayed at the Hotel Elegant with my spouse just for one evening  The price was right very inexpensive the room was very clean and the staff very pleasant  The style of the room is a bit out dated but it has all the basics except an alarm clock but you could get a wake up call  Its definitely very low key but if you are just looking for a nice quiet place to rest your head after site seeing and dont plan on spending much time in the hotel its just the right place  Also it included a yummy continental breakfast 
P => Great for the money This is a great stay for the money  It was very cheap so dont expect a palace  The hotel is clean on the inside has quite rooms is in a great location and has close off street parking  
P => What a dump This hotel is anything but quotelegant quot I have been in Motel s with more charm and grace  Tacky tacky tacky from the lobby and front desk to the rooms  The entire place reminded me more of a youth hostel than a hotel  For instance there was a crudely made sign with no frame even tacked to the wall saying no visitors after  pm The rooms were small and very cheaply and poorly furnished  Wireless internet ended up needing a wire Also there was a crappy crappy attitude on the part of the staff    very rude and obnoxous  Stay here only if you are desperate  This place bills itself as three star but probably doesnt even deserve one star  
P => ent hotel but    Hotel Elegant is advertised as a quotnew constructionquot and that is certainly true  The furniture amp fixtures appear new but thats not to say they are nice  It seems as if many things were purchased very cheaply small amp scratchy towels  ply toilet paper thin bed coverings TV with a remote that never worked  However the hotel was clean the beds firm amp comfy and the pillows fluffy  The bathroom was small but adequate which also describes the tiny shampoo packets  Having an elevator was a nice extra having no temperature control in the room   not so nice  On the plus side we loved that there was a mini fridge in the room and a super powered hair dryer in the bathroom One of our least favourite things about this hotel no parking lot  I realize this is not unusual for the Latin Quarter but it was unexpected to us  The parking space we were given was a block amp a half away underneath the library AND we had to pay for it The hotel staff were always polite and friendly and spoke English  We did not try the free breakfast but it was available between am and am The location of the hotel disturbed us at first  There is a large construction project going on directly across the street and the bus station is right behind that  Several undesirable locals often loitered around the area and we were approached by a beggar within seconds of exiting our hotel  But we soon grew accustomed to the quotfeelquot of the area including the lively quotVillagequot district just south of the hotel on Saint Catherine street  And a short walk to the west was St Denis street with its fantastic array of food amp drink amp night life  We also found it quick amp easy to reach the Metro at Maissonneuve amp Berri which is the best way to get around Montreal  All day Tourist passes are   All in all a ent hotel for the price  Fair enough place to crash after a long wonderful day spent exploring beautiful Montreal  
P => good clean hotel ent location but neighborhood can be a little questionable This hotel is fairly new and very very clean  It is a good economy budget hotel that has the bare basics but you are getting good clean accomodations and service for the cheaper price  The room had a telephone tv closet area big window and full bathroom  There is wireless internet access if you have a computer  Some rooms have mini fridges but because the hotel is newer they have not finished putting them in every room yet  There is VERY limited parking in the back of the hotel but a nearby parking lot charges  CAD a day  The hotel provides a small breakfast daily big muffin or croissant jelly tea or coffee glass of OJ and has a couple drink vending machines  The location in regards to being near excitingtourist friendly parts of Montreal is good but the street itself looks like it  sometimes get sketchy  The street is full of budget hotels and new constructions  We were there during the jazz festival so the people around the street were okay for the most part but it definitely looks like the late night crowd during an off season or certain week nights could be very questionable  Still it is close to the subway St Catherine and St Denis exciting streets with stores and nightlife a     minute walk from McGill and Mount Royal and a  minute walk from the jazz festival and underground mall  The only downside is that the walls are pretty thin so if there are noisy guests nearby you will probably be able to hear them  We could occassionally hear showers running in adjacent rooms but enjoyed our stay well enough nonetheless  
P => Sch nes neugebautes Hotel aus dem Jahr  der Vino Hotelier Famile  
P => 
P => cheap but still it does not pay its price   The carpet and closet were stinking of pee the basin was very dirty my guess is that previous guests had peed in the basin dropping all around    Only the ceiling light was working  The location is nice but extremely noisy  They advertised the availabilty of fridge and microwave actually the receptionists has them but kindly allows you to use them  The price did not match those at which I had booked the room the explanation the receptionist gave me no explanation  The advantage is that you can have a single room at a little price now I think it would be worth it to pay a bit more for both beds in a double room of another hotelhostel  
P => hahaha never ever stay here Ok this is being written from the actual hotel I felt so disgusted at the place that I have wasted no time in reviewing it  Our basic one bed room   exactly that   smells no tv no towels no lamp  just one shady twist on off light in ceiling there is soap thankfully but the horrible washroom down the hall is out of toilet paper and dirty and gross  Upstairs is a small and offputting shared shower have not committed to experiencing it yet  There are shady people going down the narrow hallway constantly they are loud and definantly up to no good  Families with noisy rude kids seem to live here too  Not a secure room as the window does not lock and it faces the street just about head height at street level Stay far far away from this dirty dodgy stained floor hotel Wish we read the reviews before we booked   wont make that mistake again 
P => Badest Hotel to stay I aboslutely agree to the others reviewer  Wost hotel I ever stayed My reservation got lost and it took me over min to chek in  had to log in at the reception computer to print out my reservation  and there Ive seen why my reservation got lost  lots of papers an list and just crap all over The hole quothotelquot smelled after campher ast you know it from mothballs  And in the room there was a bad smell of cirgarette smoke too  The rooms had to change it after one night were so small I didnt really know where to place my luggage The curtains were to short so that sun and nightlight just sined on my headThe towels and sheet dind look very clean and they havnt been replaced at anytime during my stay  The same with the rooms in general and the showers In the nights ist very noisy because of the bad windows and the busy street The only positive thig is that this hotel is next to the subway station  
P => Great Location This is the best possible hotel for people who are on a budget and arent disgusted with the idea of walking down the hall to use the washroom  The rooms ARE clean and the beds are pretty big  The hotel is small and quaint with a homey feel  This hotel is located directly on the corner of where you want to be in montreal  I walked to old montreal from there and it wasnt that long of a walk  All of the night life shopping and dining is steps away   The rates are low for a reason but I would not of changed my ision regarding this hotel  
P => STILL a very crappy place indeed Well all I can say is that I really wish I had read all the reviews here before booking a room at this place at HostelBookers  First lets get to the good  Dont worry though cause this wont take long The only good thing I can thing about this place is that it is located very close tto the Berri UQAM subway station the subway intersection station of three lines  This made getting around the city very easy NOW for the BAD   The people are right there are lot of shady characters around the place  I saw drug deals going down multiple times people running at the sight and sound of police cars gambling and a lot of bums hocking loogies left right and centre  Also during the weekend there is an excessive amount of noise because of the bar directly below this place which also invites a lot scary unwelcoming individuals Believe it or not the actual insides of the hotel are just as putrid as the outside  The showers are extremely claustrophobic and when located in the rooms are guaranteed not to open fully  The sink is located in a tiny nook in the room with no covering door or curtain  The public showers are filthy  The sheets and towels arent replaced on a daily basis  There are no phones in the rooms  The TV sucks and takes up way too much of the already limited space in the rooms  There are mice I never saw one but I suspect its true after I saw little nibbles in my cookie and its packet  The beds are mighty uncomfortable  The staff are kinda shady  The fan really does feel like its going to fall off it hinge and come crashing down on you  On my last day there was no hot water available for the showers  There are no clocks in the room  You feel like your gonna fall walking up and down the narrow stairway  Now believe you me all of these things are true  I have mixed reactions about this trip because while Montreal is an amazing and friendly place to be I feel my stay at this place made my time in Montreal uncomfortable  I really wish I had read these reviews before being suckered into this place  I only wish for two things now that I have returned home    that  YOU do not stay at this place  and that this place is CLOSED down and the surrounding area cleaned upThat being said I hope I have shed some insight into this place and hope you will enjoy your stay elsewhere in Montreal 
P => Worst hotel ever with bed bug suspicion Reading the other reviews will prepare you for the stay in this hotel  It is indeed not very tidy room smelled from cigarettes surroundings are not everybodys cup of tea it is very noisy due to the pub prostitutes and streetlife  However internet worked when we were there My bookings were lost so the manager was nice enough to keep me without costs but also without paying back the deposit I got a mattress and could stay in the room of one of my friends  Unfortunately I received more than  bug bites all over my body during my stay in Montreal  Since I was on a business trip and had virtually no outdoor activity and since I found a redish bug on my sheets I have the strong suspicion of bed bugs either in the mattress or in the floor  Neither of my friends who slept in bed got bug bites  The manager tried to play down this problem which annoyed me even more  So this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  If you really stay there make sure to take precaution for bed bug infestation  
P => European flare We arrived at the airport in Montreal late at night the hotel is quite the economy hotel and therefore has no airport shuttle  It is a flat rate of  for a taxi to downtown Montreal  The hotel has a great location it is right across the road from an entrance to the underground and Metro entrance  To enter the hotel you need to ring a buzzer for someone to let you in  hours a day  hour security  We did have some problems checking in on the first night because their credit card machine could not connect  After trying for about a half hour they told me I could pay tomorrow  Upon entering the room I noticed that there was only a sink a bed and a tv that got one english channel  However everything was very clean and there were two toilets and two showers in the hallway  My girlfriend loved it and would return in a heartbeat I personally would rather a hotel with my own shower and toilet  If you are looking for a place to simply sleep and are on a tight budget this is the place for you  If you enjoy any amenities at all keep looking  
P => Ripped off    I stayed at hotel Eureka for the Canada day long weekend  When I called the person said that the room would be  dollars a night and since there were three of us the extra person would be  a night  So the total cost for two nights should have been   Okay   so I make a reservation When I check in the bill comes to     I ask why its so high and am told that its the extra person and the taxes  This was my mistake I shrug and sign the credit card slip The bill seems way too high so I find out what the tax rate is      verified by a person at the Holiday Inn  So the bill should only be    I point out the mistake while Im checking out and am told that apparently the extra person is  each night accompanied by an official looking spreadsheet Who would agree to pay  each night for an extra mattress on the floor Not me  So bottom line is DONT MAKE A RESERVATION   THE PRICE CHANGES BETWEEN THE PHONE AND THE FRONT DESK Apart from my main complaint about feeling ripped off by the hotel guy you should also know that  the shower are extremely claustrophobic  there are some stinky people staying in the hotel  theres no AC and the ceiling fan does look like its about to fall off and kill you  the tv isnt broken   it just doesnt have cable so you get   channels in black and white  the room was tiny  parking cost   night  the floor of the closet in our room was totally gross   the tile was peeling and it was really dirty  the towels are old and threadbare  the blinds dont block out any morning sunlight bring an eye mask  theres a LOT of street noise on Saturday nights I slept fine with earplugsBut on the plus side  the hotel is less than a block from a main subway station where three subway lines intersect  its a block from the gay village which feels super safe to walk in at night as a woman anyway  the hotel has characterSo all in all if you dont reserve and manage to negotiate a reasonable price upon arrival speaking fluent french would help its not a bad place to stay  Just dont reserve in advance  
P => Shady place not recommended The area in which the hotel is located in is very dirty with a lot of weirdos roaming around  The hotel itself unlike any I have visited locks its front door at all times  They have a camera to screen its visitors and unlock the door with the buzzer  No parking is available for visitors and closest  public  parking is  per day  Had we known about the parking fee which brings the pricenight to  incl  tax we could have stayed at a hotel rated much higher and in a much better neighborhood Our room was very small despite the fact we took one of the larger and more expensive ones no ac tv with  working channels and very thin walls  People are arriving at all times of the day or night and it gets noisy even after   in the morning  We barely got any sleep during the weekend  Toilets are shared and there are  for the entire floor with   rooms  I had to wait to use them on several occasions  The service was poor rooms very not cleaned although we stayed for two nights and no fresh towels were offered  On top of it all the management has found us guilty of breaking a shower door and without notifying me has proceeded to charge my credit card   allegedly for work required  No invoice or any explanation was given except  you broke the door  and my repeated calls were not answered  I am currently considering legal action against the hotel  AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COST

P => I like to make my own opinion about hotels This is a great place for a short stay  The staff is more than accomodating  I requested no room service so they gave me extra towels and such without complication  The breakfast is bleak but it is free so beats nothing  I read about the bus station noise at am  I have difficulty sleeping and I slept well each night  I was in room  facing the bus terminal and noticed a noise when I opened the window but very quiet other than that  This place is really close to the metro and I found affordable parking with nice attendants  I was greeted only by the day employees when leaving so cant give an accurate opinion but the night crew is great They went out of their way for me My only complaint is that they wont accept tips for the valubale services they offer  I am in no way employed by the hotel as I live In NY  There are local stores open for late night needs in case one did not pack essential items  This hotel is a great place to stay 
P => Good hotel  nice room We stayed at this hotel for two nights  the room was very clean and cozy with its own washroom The hotel is located in a very convienient location old montreal ste catherine street  and also right next to the bus terminal Since we did not know anything about the city the front desk staff was very helpful They serve continental breakfast in the morning  coffee croissant oj and big muffin which was alright I have to say this hotel is pretty safe than other hotels on the same street   we saw couple of drugdealers and hookers staying in the front lobby of the other hotels on the same street overall we had a good experience for a low price If your on a budget and looking for something nice and quiet stay at this hotel  
P => Great value a ent hotel to crash in nothing fancy The negative reviews had me a bit worried but this hotel is fine as a place to crash  The cost was so reasonable thro hotwire that I was able to stay a day longer then expected  Small room  I didnt request a non smoking room and it the towels smell a bit like smoke  I also smell smoke from the other rooms and weed as well  This hotel is a few doors down from the bus terminal which is great for me  It doesnt seem close enough to hear the terminal noise that review confused me because there is another hotel directly behind the terminal  Its been pretty quiet though Ive gotten a good nights sleep  Im using the free wireless internet while eating breakfast in bed  The breakfast you pick up at the front desk and bring to your room coffee oj and a big muffin  Short walking distance to downtown Montreal  Good value if you need an inexpensive modest place to crash  
P => Punaises  Lors de notre s jouron a  t  victime de punaises  Cet h tel pourtant paraissait correct alors m fiez vousLaccueil  tait tr s moyen et notre chambre sentait la cigarette  
P => Perfectly suited for our needs My boyfriend and I are both university students  Being on a tight budget we wanted to get away for a weekend in an affordable way  Hotel Europeene met our needs perfectly  This hotel offered us a very good rate a clean room a comfortable bed and friendly service  The hotel is two blocks from rue St  Catharine lots of shopping restaurants and the liquor store  They offered muffins and coffee for breakfast  Wireless internet as well allowed us to keep up with our course work and emails  
P => Clean and Cozy location stellar  minute walk from central bus station  minute walk from central subway station  minute walk from Montreal Jazz Festival   minute walk from Old Montrealthe room smallcozy but clean  modern bathroom   no cracks no water leakage no holes in the walls  tv well working refrigerator  room cleaned after first day and thereafter on request  plenty of clean towels on request  breakfast drab  microwave heated croissantsmuffins with crappy coffee  but meh   such an affordable hotel who cares  no elevator in hotel so if youre on the fourth floor look forward to some stair climbing  if you have special needs e g  weelchair there is no ramp to climb the steps into hotel friendly desk staff  no curfew  
P => Reasonable hotel for a short stay This hotel is a family run business  Some of the rooms are a bit on the small side but they are clean and the furnishings are well taken care of  It opened its doors to the public in the year   This hotel is ideal for a short stay if you are just looking for a place to crash after a long day of sightseeing in Montreal and you are not really looking for luxury and amenities  If you have a car there is a parking lot half way down the block and you can buy a parking pass for the day at the hotel lobby  The hotel is in downtown Montreal near the bus terminal station in a lower middle class neighborhood  
P => Most convenient I chose the Europeene online  I selected it because of the price  I was delighted to discover that the shuttle from the airport drops you right off behind the hotel  I have the same complaint about the airconditioning the others have  The fellow behind the desk gave the impression that they operated the airconditioning on demand and controlled each room individually  Who knows I thought the quotContinental Breakfastquot was fine  Before we arrived my wife was a bit miffed at me for choosing such an inexpensive spot sight unseen but she enjoyed the stay  Our first night was red by our neighbors who slammed the door repeatedly  They were knocking it off the hinges and rattling our walls  We asked the management to speak to them they were young kids and as soon as management left they were slamming it again  We asked for and received another room and we were fine for the rest of the week  We enjoyed ourselves immensely  Montreal is a beautiful city  You  be interested to know that the Hotel Europeene is one of many comparable hotels on the same road  If youre unsure if youll like it you can book one night there and then choose one of the others nearby  I dont think the other hotels have an internet presence  
P => Only if you are desperate Stayed here for a week because of the price and price alone  The air conditioning is not very good only the hallways are cool the room was so hot I left the windows open anyway  Of course that didnt help much because then the noise from the bus station was loud  Breakfast as mentioned by others was a joke On the other hand the room was fairly clean and the location near the central Berri metro station cant be beat  Would I repeat No I would spend a few extra bucks and stay someplace else  
P => Terrible I walked into my room which reeked of pot and then tried to get some rest but my room overlooked the BUS TERMINAL  the buses dont stop until midnight and start up at about am  Also whenever I left the room I came back and found a note that said quottips pleasequot  It was unnerving  Didnt get phone messages and was unimpressed with the place  On the up side it was clean  
P => eptive advertising  online purchasers beware Some main points which travellers should be aware or beware of  Courtyard view  Dont expect plants or even to face other hotel units  This essentially overlooks an ugly small enclosed area where airconditioning units and fire stairwells etc exist  Airconditioning  It is centrally controlled I guess by management and there is no temperature control in the room  Sorry Free Continental Breakfast The way it works is  the receptionist at the counter will give a very measured quantity of OJ and CoffeeTea Only one available and a choice of one KirklandCostco croissantmuffin per guest in a room  Very pathetic reduces the whole breakfast advertisement to a sham  Poor noise insulation There is lot of noise when people walk around etc because of poor noise insulation between floors  Really small room area After checking in with a suitcase and a travel duffel bag my wife and I found there is absolutely no area to move around  The entire space is occupied by the bed  Room service doesnt respect privacy   This despite hanging a quotDont disturbquot sign on the door  The whole room was made up etc in our absence even though we didnt want it  
P => Got My Moneys Worth Cleanliness and convenience are the Europeennes strengths  My room was very small but absolutely spotless and had all the necessary basics TV hair dryer refrigerator phone  The hotel is located literally across the parking lot from the main bus station where the shuttle from the airport drops offpicks up passengers  Its also half a block from a subway station and from a shopping mall with plenty of food choices including a small grocery store  There are also plenty of other restaurants in the area ranging from McDonalds to casual sit down  Old Montreal is about a  minute walk away  The immediate neighborhood isnt very pretty and a nearby park seems to attract vagrants in the evening but I never felt unsafe The quotbreakfastquot is simply croissants and percolated coffee dry quotcreamquot and it isnt served until  a m  which was too late for me  Youre better off walking to the mall for a latte and fresh muffin at the Coffee Depot opens at  a m  My only real quotcomplaintquot is that the building is old lots of wood I think so sounds travel  My room was next to a stairwell and it sounded like herds of elephants going up and down all evening  On the second night of my stay the room directly above me was occupied and while the residents themselves were fine no loud music or parties or such their footsteps while just walking around were very loud and kept me awake even when wearing earplugs  Bottom line   I definitely got my moneys worth and I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again but only if I could get a room on the top third floor  
P => Cute little place My boyfriend and I stayed here for this past weekend and found it to be guite nice  Obviously not a luxury hotel but VERY clean every piece of linentowels were freshly washed and the room was immaculate  The staff are friendly enough and the location is awesome with in walking distance of everything you could need The only cons I could see were that there was no real policy about smoking and the staff openly smoked at the front desk  However hard core smoke a phobes should be ware of Montreal in general since smoking was allowed in EVERY restaurant and bar we went to with no division from the non smoking section the window to our room faced out onto the bus station and as such we were not able to keep the window open for any extended period of time  With it closed however it was not at all noisy and we werent expecting a picturesque view anyway All in all if youre looking for a cheap and above all clean place to stay in Montreal Id recommend this hotel  Its no Hilton but it was very quaint and charming in its own way  
P => budget room this place is okay  i stayed once last year and am staying again this year  the room i stayed in was an extra large closet  the front desk is very alert bc there are some quotless desirablesquot who walk up and down this street  i am hoping that the parking lot will be safe for my car as i might drive up this time  there is a parking lot up the street a little ways  i saw another reviewer say that it was not very expensive so this is a good thing   b  
P => good value Went to Montreal in ember for a long weekend with my girlfriend  I was afreaid that only a dive could offer such inexpensive prices but we were pleasantly surprised  We were close to all the sites we wanted to see  For a few extra dollars we parked in the lot up the block and spent the weekend walking  The rooms were clean and serviceable and the staff helpful  If your looking for fancy or elegant this is not the place for you  However if your looking for a safe place to rest and keep your stuff in between adventures in the city then this is the place  
P => Location location This is a spartan but well kept property  The staff was friendly and courteous and all spoke English when my limited French failed  The hotel is a half block from Montreals main subway station and central bus terminal  The frequent airport bus service runs from the bus station so this is an excellent place to stay if you dont have a car Despite the central location and busy daytime traffic the street Rue St Hubert was surprisingly quiet at night  Id definitely stay there again  
P => Great location  Almost every summer my husband and I head up to Montreal in y for the Just for Lhs Festival this quaint little hotel is just what we where looking for  We had a room at the end of the nd floor which was very cozy the staff at the front desk was very helpful and nice landed a parking spot right in front of the door and the hotel was within walking distance of the Just for Lhs FestivalFor those not wanting to pay high rates for a place to shower amp sleep but still wanting friendly service amp location in downtown I would definately recommend this place  
P => ok for the price This hotel is our default accomodation in Montreal if we dont want to spend a lot of money  It usually has rooms available  Its in a street with lots of very cheap hotels which we havent dared to explore yet and the bus terminal is close by  Its fairly new and the furnishings of the rooms are functional and clean but it has no charm  On weekends we usually park on the street but there is also a small parking lot close by which you can book through the hotel  Each room has cable TV  There is no breakfast room you just pick up your coffee and muffin at the desk and eat in your room  In principle you can walk to the pedestrian zone with all the restaurants or to the Latin Quarter  but we usually take the car since its not that close  During the winter you can often get better deals in one of the fancier hotels but in the summer this hotel is a good value  
P => Quite okay for the price  a very basic hotel more like a lodge  motel  Air conditioning was not too effective and some rooms are in the basement of the hotel  So footsteps  disturb a light sleeper  I would recommend requesting for a room on the ground  st floor  Staff is good and helpful  hotel includes free breakfast coffee muffin and cereals  Location is very central  Over all good for the price

P => Perfect in every way I am a former travel editor at one of the most upscale American magazines  I have travelled the globe and am never unduly impressed    and cant bear pretension  But I was totally taken with the Hotel Gault  Small exceptionally gracious staff stunning and chic superb location on quiet side street on the edge of Old Town  Two minute walk to metro  Totally stylish and original hotel    vel at how they took an old warehouse made it cutting edge modern in appointments and kept it at the same time warm and welcoming  Not hard edge like a Shrager hotel  Really magical  In the a m  they bring you wake up coffee    when youre ready  Lovely to return to a hotel where they know your name     and yet you are in a big city  
P => Agree with All the Great Reviews The staff at this hotel should be cloned They made our stay there feel like we were family Only negative was the carpet in our room had stains on it  Otherwise we were extremely comfortable the bed was wonderful loved the linens and drapes  Will definitely return  
P => Perhaps the finest Hotel Ive ever stayed at    My wife and I ided to book a trip to Montreal and at the last minute brought my parents along as well  The four of us stayed at the Hotel Gault which I found through Tripadvisor  We stayed on the th floor in an Etcetera room while my parents were on the th floor top  room  Both rooms were minimalist in design but that only lended to the vast spaciousness of them  It was like having a big loft size apartment in the city  First and foremost besides the exquisite rooms the staff at this hotel were superb  Bruno our bellman drew up city itineraries for us and was accommodating every step of the way  Then there was Brian who worked the front desk  Brian gave us restaurant recommendations that were spot on  Everywhere he told us to eat ended up being delicious  When we were leaving for back home we were low on ice and Andre another staffer ran down the street to get us more  He then stood on the corner in front of the hotel with another employee waving goodbye as we drove off  Ive stayed at hotels all over the world and never have I seen the level of excellence that this place exudes in every area  Beautiful rooms impeccable staff and the value for your money can not be beat ANYWHERE in Montreal  One last note the Gault is a  star hotel and on this same trip because Gault was booked for our last night we not my parents had to check into a famous  star downtown Montreal hotel  This place although nice couldnt hold a candle to our experience at Gault  In fact when our bathroom TV was broken and our mini bar key didnt fit the staffers told us quotwell take care of itquot not once apologizing  We were just another number   that is something we never felt at the Hotel Gault  The staff there waited on us hand and foot  All  of us give the Hotel Gault our highest recommendation and cant wait to go back  
P => Spacious and comfortable but  We booked one of the Extrassential rooms which are the corner rooms above the entrance to the hotel at the intersection of rue Sainte H l ne and rue des Recollets  Unfortunately at the time of our visit the building catty corner from the entrance to Hotel Gault was undergoing reation which meant construction noise outside our window from about  am to pm on weekdays  This actually wasn t too loud at first but on the third morning of our stay the city started ripping up two streets near the hotel  rue Sainte H l ne and rue Notre Dame  and THAT was pretty darn loud  And of course the loudest part of it always seemed to occur at  in the morning  Not exactly what one wants to deal with on a vacationOther than that our room was very comfortable spacious and stylish the best parts were the large shower and having  tall windows that could be opened out onto the street  There was a lot of storage space in the room  DVDs and newspapers were available downstairs and the staff was friendly and helpful  The free breakfast is served until  am  on weekdays later on weekends which is a first for any hotel I ve stayed at  One negative was that the in room safe was very light and not bolted down which made it seem easy for someone to pick up and remove not that anyone would be desperate enough to want my obsolete iPod but perhaps other travelers actually have something valuable to store  The hotel is on the edge of Vieux Montreal and we were amused that when we took the walking tour of Montreal from Guidatour it stopped at one point in front of our hotel we could also watch the horse drawn carriages going by from our window  The hotel is about a  minute walk from metro Square Victoria but a longer walk to Place Jacques Cartier   minutes  I should note that the windows are very thick and the construction noise is probably a lot less noticeable in the rooms further down rue des Recollets away from rue Sainte H l ne  Thankfully construction is always temporary  
P => Real hidden gem   definitely recommend Stayed in the lull between xmas and new year  What a great hotel great location rooms good size wonderful bathrooms  Stylish staff lovely  Oh and great to have a little gym  Only slight criticism might be the lack of food available outside of breakfast hours not huge choice  
P => Nice place convenient location Gault hotel is truly a nice place to stay room is beautifully or huge in size and with details of style i e  the curtain used to arate bedroom from bathroom much original than a simple concrete wall that make your stay enjoyable  To be honest there are a couple of things that don t seem to fit at least in my room the red chair and the tea table were somewhere out of place  All the other pieces of furniture from the carpets to the bed linen were just superb and matched nicely  Staff was helpful breakfast delicious not huge selection but everything fine specially fruit salad and hotel very conveniently located just at the door of vieux Montreal main attractions On the downside just a couple of small things  the very street door doesn t make a welcome feeling there is a flight of stairs from street level up to reception if there is no a porter on hand he wasn t when we arrived you have to push your luggage all the way up  no funny business   although the breakfast is included if you want to order something different from filter coffee you should pay extra 
P => When only the best will do    Stayed at the Gault  nights this ust during the Rogers Cup tennis tournament If you like small hotels with great designamenities amp superb servicethis is the place for younot to mention the exquisite breakfast which is included  free internet The hotel has class amp the staff could not be any friendlierAn oasis of piece in the perfect location  
P => getting old and tired only basic services This is the last time we will be staying at the Gault   time to move on  Carpets in rooms are dirty and need changing  Service is deteriorating  Bar service is minimal  No help with luggage  Hotel was never designed with comfort and travellers need in mind  This was ok as long as the o and service was outstanding Now the hotel is just irritating  dont get me wrong its not a bad place    it just isnt what it used to be  
P => Good but impersonal I stayed two nights in one of the loft rooms on the top floor  I had high expectations resulting largely from the enthusiasm of trip advisor reports  As a functional hotel it worked reasonably well  The style was modern no fuss and reasonable quality  The receptionconcierge people were helpful  The location is good   on the fringe of the old town  It wasentirely satisfactory but not in nay way exciting  The ground floor area is perfectly functional but somewhat soulless  The room was much larger than I needed or wanted and again rather cold concrete floor with rugs  There were minor niggles such as the breakfast arae being too small for the number of guests and the relative inefficiency of the staff  Would I stay there again   yes if I couldnt do better  But Im reasonably confident I will do better  
P => Gushing over Gault Hotel Gault was the epitome of class sophistication modern design and charm  My stay here was very comfortable and relaxing  The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful and the rooms were minimalisticloved and so beautifully set up  I loved the heated tiles in the bathroom  The rooms had such a modern romantic feeling to them The breakfast was nothing short of delicious as well as their signature cocktail  I had a fantastic stay here and would recommend it to anyone going for business or pleasure  
P => A chic and elegant choice This was our rd stay at the Hotel Gault in the past few years this time to attend the Montreal Jazz Festival  Once again we were very pleased with the experience at this true boutique hotel  Service is thorough and professional  The building is a reated heritage warehouse and the rooms only about  rooms in all have very high ceilings polished concrete floors most not all huge Parisienne windows lush beds and a cool layout pocket doors washrooms that open into the room with private WC  The location is perfect for us   on the very northwest corner of Old Montreal close to the dining shopping and culture but surrounded by heritage office buildings that assure a quiet nights sleep  We love the understated elegance and will defiitely return    again  Ask for a room with a balcony   they are very limited  They also have  great suite that we had on our previous visit that has an adjoining room that is perfect for  couples travelling together or a family with older children  Outstanding value  
P => Perfect We hope the owner of the Hotel Gault appreciates his fantastic staff  They are truly the nicest people you will ever meet and competent to boot  Thank you Andre I still hate myself for not listening to you twice and the rest of the lovely people at the beautiful Hotel Gault  We miss you and cant wait to come back  Steve and Lynn Detroit 
P => Impeccable   be the best hotel I ever stayed at I recently spent  nights at Hotel Gault Montreal I was extremely impressed with the hotel and felt that it was superior to all the other Tripadvisor hotels I stayed at during my Trip to Las Vegas Montreal Quebec and Mont Tremblant including the Four SeasonsWestinetc  All the other ones were great but Hotel Gault has got something SPECIAL    a sense for incredible design and or  In fact besides the Four Seasons Maui it might have been the best hotel I ever stayed at PROs  The interior design of Hotel Gault is world class  The chairs the beds the tables the showers   it is all very practical but also very beautiful    The loft style rooms are simply gorgeous with high ceilings and beds that make you want to spend all day in bed  Extremely comfortable   No room is the same so youll get a bit of a different experience every time youre at the hotel  The front desks employees and the concierges are extremely knowledgeable and very friendly  Internet and breakfast is FREE  The location is in a quiet street in Old Town Montreal  Simply perfect CONs  This is hard    the only thing I can think of is that it takes from  am to  pm to get clothes dry cleaned unless you want to pay  extra  And if you require a bath tub instead of a shower make sure you make your reservation by phone most rooms only have a shower When staying in Montreal this is THE place to be  You dont have to trust me but you can trust Bill Clinton he always stays there when hes in town  
P => Very artistic but not always practical We do not usually use this kind of hotel but were seduced by the comments of others on TA  Though the overall experience was good there were little irritations that could be addressed  chipped paint in the bathroom dodgy curtain fixings no in room coffee making facility the only full length mirror being in the toilet insufficient rails to hang towels  However the location is first class and the staff very friendly and helpful  The rooms are huge if you stay on the top floor as we did  
P => Another Great Vist to the Gault In ruary my wife and I had spent time at the Gault in one of their larger rooms  This time we chose their basic level room queen bed no bathtub as nothing else was available  Once again the service was superb and the room immaculate  We really enjoyed the room with its bare stone wall and huge window overlooking an inner courtyard really car park as it was dead quiet and private  The design of the room was great though fans of watching TV would be disappointed as the TV was small and not a flat screen  We read from their extensive design and art library in the lobby so were totally satisfied  The breakfast buffet had a good variety of food and the coffee was superb  
P => We loved the Gault  My wife and were in Montreal for a vacation and based on TA reviews took a room at the Gault  The place more than lived up to the big hype  Terrific location about   blocks from the Metro walking around in Vieux Montreal extremely cordial friendly and helpful service and a fantastic breakfast  It was a bit difficult for our minibus driver to find but the Gault is really just a very quiet block off busy McGill and not hard to find at all  We stayed there for four nights and loved our comfortable minimalist room  Would definitely stay at the Gault again  
P => Contemporary luxury hotel in an excellent location We loved our stay at the Hotel Gault  We stayed in one of the corner rooms which was spacious  The bed was sooooo comfortable and the large windows let in a lot of natural light  The only downside is that the hotel is very minimal and there were no extras in the room like teacoffee making  The breakfast buffet which was included in the rate was ok but no hot food and some of the choices were a bit odd for breakfast  I asked for scrambled eggs and bacon and when it came it was inedible and when challenged he only replaced the scrambled eggs and the bacon was then cold I then found out that I had to pay  CAN  for this breakfast However overall this is a fantastic hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful  It is also in a vellous location for sightseeing  
P => Best Place to Stay in Montreal I will keep this short because everything I say about this hotel has been previously written  The rooms and bathrooms are enormous and comfortable  The place is the perfect size for a boutique hotel and in a great location  The food at the restaurant is amazing tasty and so artistic  You really cannot find a better place to stay in Montreal for the price  
P => Perfect city boutique hotel ideal location We stayed four nights at the Hotel Gault  Impeccable friendly service with real insider knowledge  Very comfortable boutique hotel rooms spotlessly clean perfect bathrooms free high speed WiFi access in the receptionlobby area  High end and tasty buffet breakfast available Hotel Gault is perfectly situated in the western part of old Montreal  Five minute walk to Square Victoria metro station  Ten minute walk to centre of old Montreal  Fifteen minute walk to Rue St Catherine shopping district Would heartily recommend this hotel and very happy to stay there again  
P => Refreshingly different from other hotels Fulfilled every expectation of being unusual luxurious and the ideal retreat  If you want something small with all the mod essentials and more personality and a sleeker style than typical white space design hotels then this is it  Great for independent travellers wanting a haven but still right in the centre  Would definitely choose Gault again  In a quiet but convenient zone between the charming old town with its many different types of restaurants and the mass shopping and business districts  The quiet street and area felt safe at night  Victoria Square Metro is  minutes walk away and the main train station is under  minutes  You dont hear a sound from the street Enough touches of softness and colour to make it feel welcoming and the spacious open plan reception bar and breakfast area has cosy corners  In the rooms high ceilings and pared down interiors give a bright airy feel  Unlikely to be any bad choice of room here  Stayed in two types and both were much larger than the norm  The slightly smaller room could do with a work desk rather than slim table Breakfast over the weekend especially has a wide choice  More continental style rather than cooked it has plenty to keep you interested and looks like the chef has carefully chosen to add a touch of variety rather than the same every day  Attentive staff always seemed alert  
P => Trendy Casual but Business friendly Terrific Service I just spent the weekend at Hotel Gault celebrating my husbands birthday  Located on the quieter western edge of Old Montreal the hotel is a ten minute walk to the waterfront Place Jacques Cartier and Hotel W its rival  The elevator serves five floors the th floor has  rooms with gym in the basement  The  restaurant  is in the lobby and comprises about  tables at one side more formal and  round casual tables with multicoloured chairs close to the bar  All the furniture is contemporary the lobby seat looks like an open baseball glove  The back of the lobby is arranged with artsy fartsy magazines and side wall with DVDs all terrific  We watched Kurosawa again staying up until  am  I wanted a room with a stone or brick wall because I get nervous around modern Toronto style architecture thus reserving the Terra room  There was a wedding so the Terra room had disappeared and we were  upgraded  to a room that gave me the wobblies it had no age to it no olden wall and I had even lined this room during the reservation process because of this fact  I refused this room and asked for  a downgrade please  much to the shock of the staff  No joy  Instead we ended up in a suite that was truly magnificent with corner window and iette balcony clad in wooden shutters  A sitting area with large screen TV faced a rectangular sofa no cushions and very uncomfortable in the long term for watching movies this zone spanned by a stunning multicoloured carpet  There were  speakers one of which worked  Apparently they all work only with the DVD and it took someone   minutes to turn it on for us  After he removed his test DVD we could not get ours to work  There s something about spending time with hi tech when you travel it s annoying learning new systems  Then there is a dining table and small kitchenette arating the eating from sleeping areas  The miele hot plate accommodates  pans  is supplied  The cooking accoutrements ranked a  but we were not there to cook so no problem  There was a sort of coffee machine that looked like a combination ice cream maker meets playdoh squishing machine  No coffee was supplied  that s deliberate madame  nor mugs nor sugar  Missing also was the  flash light supplied in your safe   Sometimes I fret about what is not in the room that is supposed to be in the room  Will it appear on my credit card in the future Instead room service was needed for coffee and you were on your own in an electrical outage  The best coffee on the planet was then served in a piping hot thermos enough for   cups read an immediate call for a nd thermos was essential if my husband wanted to quench his thirst  The bed is king size and has what appears to be a down quilt and pillows  The bedding was terrific the bed was not as comfortable  The bathroom had a beautiful large oval tub for two with large shower and Grohe spray  We have those at home and no we would not get them again think WaterPic  Too bad no hot tub  Square sink on rectangular surface  Molton Brown bottles  The concrete floor was not cold but my hooves turned slightly black  Nooks and crannies hid clothing ironing board etc  It was a great space uber trendy and bordering on a high tech lawyers office not my kind of home from home  The receptionist Brian said that this was one of their best rooms  But watch out guys the rooms are beginning to look shabby  The glass table in the living room had chips along the edges the second table attached to it was at a slight misaligned angle watch those wine glasses the door over the  safe  was warped and detaching broken vases were hidden in kitchen drawers and that cute magazine holder in the pathway of everyone moving into the lounge area has been dinged so many times the vertical edges look like they have teeth  The room we moved up from was also shabby tears in the bed platform textile black rubberized streaks on the light grey concrete floor  And that room was an office that happened to have a bed in it  can I plug your computer in for you madame  I feel guilty for pointing these detractions out having been upgraded but be someone will pay attention to detail and make your stay even more special than was ours  With respect to service the best received to date on this planet from valet parking to check out  Kudos to Remi  The brunch on Sunday was stunning  Not the Montreal bagel here folks  But delicate if beans can be called delicate salads of Gourmet Bistro quality and great variety  Boconcini on tomato  And desserts icot crumble to die for  Don t miss brunch folks More coffee  Yes more  Grapefruit and orange juice  Make yourself seated in the lobby  We took the Blissful Deluxe package we each had  mins of massage in our room by a zen artist a DVD later a cocktail not of our choice vodka lychee and cranberry and a glass of wine instead of champagne  Strawberries dipped in chocolate  The system was a little strange we didn t know where were the coupons  we ran out  or whether we had the chocolates with the cocktail  no with the champagne  or if we used the TV to order the DVD  no they are in the lobby for pick up   We asked for an extension of stay past the noon check out and were happily granted it we stayed less than half an hour longer  Our car was brought around  The total bill was around  for one night plus we left  in tips valet parking the masseuse room service  I never know what to do here but that seemed fair at the time  So the rooms were   service  parking  brunch  coffee   Perhaps I m a little hard to serve at times I notice small things like someone else taking a table cleared and set for us I am currently walking challenged courtesy of an ice wipe out near Schwartz  smoked meat and the other tables were the farthest possible from the buffet so dealing with me   I also noticed that this was a friendly hotel for gays so  for that too  My tip is to come on a special weekend when the fireworks are on a festival is in town like the jazz fest or Fete des lumieres when most all the galleries are open  hours  A hotel that is great for the s s crowd single in pairs or threesomes  Montreal has much to offer and Old Montreal even has brick walls in your bedroom  And thanks Again Brian for the room upgrade 
P => Would definitely return again    Just returned from a long weekend at Hotel Gault  While the weather in Montreal was chilly the Gault was warm friendly and inviting  With help from Andre and the staff we were able to find our way around Montreal with ease  Lots of great restaurants within walking distance and the Centre Bell where we attended the Celine Dion concert was a mere  minute walk away  The rooms are simple but equipped with what a traveler would need while away from home  The beds are comfy and warm and the bathroom clean  We enjoyed the brunch the cocktail at happy hour and the chocolates on the bed at nighttime  We will definitely be back    hopefully when the weather is a bit warmer 
P => Consistently excellent discreet hip boutique hotel in Montreal GoodI have stayed at Hotel Gault half a dozen times over the past three years  It is consistently excellent fair prices especially if booked in advance fantastic non smoking public spaces great breakfast buffet and cool comfortable rooms  There is free WiFi throughout the hotel and the location on the slightly gritty edge of the old city Vieux Port is fantastic BadFront desk service is always good    but sometimes it is only just good  For instance I am never recognized as a repeat visitor and the staff can sometimes be a bit cold    but not always sometimes they are fine  The rooms are air heated which can lead to dryness  Not all rooms have tubs    though the showers are terrific  Most rooms have single wash basins for those who have grown accustomed 
P => Tasty Brunch in wonderful ambiance Since we live in Montreal did not stay at the hotel but went there for the brunch on Sunday morning  The service was fast friendly and professional  Delightful ambiance loved the artwork furnishings and Christmas derations and excellent not your standard brunch foods combination of ordering from menu and buffet  highly recommend for visitors and Montrealers alike 
P => Fantastic Service with only a few suggestions We really loved our stay at the hotel  When we walked in Andre was there to greet us with a warm smile  He knows his stuff and use his suggestions and expertise  The front staff was very warm and helpful especially for small requests spa suggestions etc The location was great although too bad it was cold were from the West Coast so we are not good with cold LOL  The hotel lobby was amazing   I loved the art pieces  The room was clean simple and modern  The heated tile floor was great in the bathroom  The bed was super comfy and overall a great view of Old Montreal from our Extraessential room The one thing we both raved about was the breakfast that was included with our room price  It was DELICIOUS I will never look at continental breakfast the same ever again Great coffee great selection and loved the choice of a la carte For the price we paid we had a government rate which is around the same as the promo rate there was nothing substantial to complain about  We would come back again for sure and I loved Montreal so much Our only suggestions werealthough I was told that there were significant changes happenning in terms of reations new artwork paint tvs etc  in the next year   cant waita flat screen lcd tv screensb perhaps an ipod docking stationc the shower needed a bit of a scrub and some washroom fixtures looked a little wornd the floors were a little worn but nothing bige the gym be a bit bigger more equipment not that people come to montreal to work outf the toiletries i would have recommended something other than the spruce scent   i know scent is very particular and the brand they offered was excellent i just thought it was very masculineOther than the above thanks to all the amazing staff and what a wonderful beautiful hotel  
P => Great Boutique Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Gault for a week long vacation  It was one of our favorite hotels  It is well located in Old Montreal  We were able to walk or take the Metro to all Montreal neighborhoods  The other reviews on TA were accurate and helped finalize our choice The hotel is modern and minimalistic  It is a wonderful blend of an upscale boutique hotel yet not over the top and intimidating  There  not be as many bells and whistles as other traditional luxury hotels but I thought the key choices were well made  The staff is extraordinarily gracious and multi talented  Michel and Brian were especially helpful in their restaurant recommendations and we enjoyed our many conversations with them  We reserved the extrassential room which was a spacious corner room with large windows that opened  While the concrete floor did show some wear it did not detract from our stay and the room was very clean When we return to Montreal we would definitely return to Hotel Gault  
P => Believe all the raving comments My husband and I went to Montreal for the first time this past summer and were looking for a modern nice hotel close to Old Montreal  Travel and Leisure recommended this hotel we found a good deal on the hotel website and we booked it We had a fantastic time in Montreal and the staff at Hotel Gault especially their concierge Andre I think was his name made our stay memorable  Andre got us a reservation at a near by restaurant called Le Locale it serves inative french food  The hotel was comfortable clean modern and with diferent spaces to relax from the gym to the lobby to the library We loved this hotel and would go back  I have read other reviews here my advise to you dear reader is believe all the raving  This hotel is great 
P => Top Notch Service Just returned from a  night stay at the Hotel Gault  We obtained our research from this website and our efforts paid off  All the positive reviews of this hotel are on the k  The hotel is in a convenient location in old Montreal the rooms are large comfortable and clean and the staff were enormously gracious and helpful  The breakfast was exceptional as well  We have travelled throughout the world and have stayed at many wonderful hotels and this hotel is at the top of our list for price comfort and service  We will definitely recommend to any of our friends who plan on visiting Montreal Steve amp HeatherSt  Catharines Ontario Canada 
P => Hotel Gault was more than good but     there were few things that fell short  The hotel is very attractive and the staff were mostly friendly but sometimes they would be so overwhelmed with one client checking in or out that the entire staff seemed to be dealing with them and not realizing another guest waiting to speak to them should have been acknowledged  Also the hotel front is on a corner of two side streets there is no real quotpull upquot if you arrive by car   also since there is no doorman on the street and you have to open the street doors go up a flight of stairs go through another door and then cross the room to find someone who works there that was unfortunate on our arrival as we didnt know how to negotiate our luggage parking etc  Secondly I asked for the Terra Room as I was interested in the free standing tub  The tub was wonderful but the room itself had concrete floors with only a small rug on either side of the bed and the floors were very very ked up and appeared dirty and the rugs were stained so that was a little disappointing when checking in but we got over it  All in all I thought the hotel staff was helpful and friendly when approached the breakfast was good the price reasonable the linens fresh and the location very convenient to Old Montreal but we also walked easily to the shopping and museum area  
P => Minimalist chic with warmth and creature comfort All the positive TA reviews of Hotel Gault are   true Our recent two night stay at Hotel Gault was absolutely perfect minimalist chic but with warmth and outstanding creature comfort We loved the blend of the old and ornate architectural exterior with the more stark and loft design of the interior  The public spaces had both a rarefied and inviting openness about it with clever combinations of warm blond wood and tin ceiling and concrete walls with wonderful displays of modernist art and whimsical but perfectly comfortable furniture  Our Extraessentiel room with its high ceiling was huge and the bathroom with its arate tile amp glass shower and its arate tub was also spacious   approaching the size of an entire hotel room in some cities The bed and bed and bath linen were all plush and of excellent quality  The or was minimalist and stylish with use of warm colors  Service was exceedingly nice and attentive  The bountiful breakfast service with an abundant variety started at  with coffee and espresso made to order  The location in Old Montreal was charming with small restaurants and coffee shops nearby while being a little away from the heavier tourist traffic it took us about  minutes on foot to get to Centre Ville for our work related meeting which made for a nice and enjoyable way for us to see the street and sidewalk culture of both sides of Montreal  I am afraid that now that Hotel Gault has just re affirmed for us the meaning of quotboutiquequot we will be obsessed with finding something similar to it whenever we travel 
P => One of our finest hotel experiences ever Wow We travel often for both business and leisure and when a special birthday trip brought us to Montreal we chose the Hotel Gault  What an excellent ision we made Simply put this is one of the two or three finest hotels Ive ever been to anywhere in the world  And for its price range its certainly    The closest comparison in terms of quality location and service I can think of is the wonderful MyHotel Chelsea in London As other reviewers have stated the property itself is gorgeous  We were in a quotTerraquot room and it certainly lived up to the amazing reviews  Another fantastic feature was the included breakfast and we even had dinner at the property once The staff were universally wonderful  Polite friendly helpful and patient with my embarrassingly bad French Im working on it While the location is great and central especially for those looking to do some sight seeing and quottouristyquot things we spent the bulk of our time several Metro stops away easily accessible from the nearby station Thank you Hotel Gault for being the cornerstone of a wonderful vacatino  
P => Fantastic Stay at Hotel Gault The tripadvisor reviewers were right on  We had a fantastic stay at the Hotel Gault located in charming Old Montreal and within walking distance to the downtown area Victoria Square Metro Station and Chinatown  We were in the Terra Room which was more spacious well designed and furnished than I anticipated the hotel photos didnt do it justice at all  The service was exceptional with nightly turn down service weather reports for the next day and bottled water  Although room could be a bit high we were able to save a bit by prepaying in advance  
P => Super Excellent hotel  Staff extremely helpful  Accommodations wonderful  orated in modern style in great taste  Breakfast included was delicious  Within walking distance of Old Montreal  Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel  
P => Missing the breakfast My girlfriend and I spent  great nights at Hotel Gault and were beyond pleased with the level of service and hospitality of the staff  Since the hotel is quite popular and was booked full we had to stay in an Extrassential room for two nights and a Extential room on our final night  And let me just say both room types were amazing  The extrassential is a spacious corner suite with three large windows offering somewhat of a panoramic view to the outside  We had one slight problem however on our first night here we noticed there was hair belonging to perhaps a previous guest on our bedsheets  Yuck My girlfriend hated this I didnt mind as much  But when we called the front desk they quickly addressed the problem and had two housekeepers assigned to change our bed sheets right away  After this issue the rest of our stay was smooth sailing The Extential room was also very nice a bit smaller  Yet it actually felt a lot more warm and homey to us compared to the first room we had  Both rooms were great but the smaller room just felt more comfortable  The drawback to this room type though is that youll have no privacy when getting ready in the bathroom The thing I will miss the most   by far   will be the courtesy continental breakfast they serve every morning  I love to eat and I eat well  I can say that the breakfast spread they offer is too good to be true  It was the best breakfast experience I have ever had Everything is served fresh and is prepared with a sense of artistic detail  I just loved waking up each morning knowing that the greatest breakfast in the Americas was waiting for me down in the hotel lobbyOverall this hotel is top notch in Montreal and one that I would absolutely recommend to young people couples and even families  It is a very chic establishment in a cool quiet neighborhood  I will definitely stay here again if I ever visit Montreal again  
P => Hotel Gault is superb Superb room breakfast included lobby lounge  Room was very quiet well provisioned  Great dinner in restaurant at reasonable price  Wonderful service was icing on the cake Not for budget travellers but good value for everyone else at  given breakfast and two drinks were included in the price  Breakfast usually  p p  and includes a buffet as well as hot food from a menu  Highly recommended  
P => Exceptional Warm  I cannot recommend this hotel enough  The building is stunning  Request a room on the th floor they have very nice outdoor patio areas  Beautiful contemporary rooms with very comfortable beds amp linens Excellent value  
P => Another GREAT experience at the Gault     This is my nd stay with this hotel  I actually flew up several years ago when the hotel first opened and I had a great trip then  I flew to Montreal for business and I knew that I wanted to stay at the Gault again  This stay was as good as the first trip  The first trip I booked a quotTerraquot room but this time I booked a quotTop quot room  I booked directly with the hotel from their website and they are very quick to confirm and all communications were great  The quotTop  quot room that I booked was spacious and it was on one of the top floors  It also had a nice outdoor patioterrace that I could walk out onto for fresh air  The bed was very comfortable and it had a small TV with a DVD player  There was no wi fi in the room but wi fi worked from the lobby  The room had free high speed internet with a cable but it was a bit uncomfortable as the desk was a high bar area and the chair wasnt the most comfortable  The bathroom had a nice shower  The area is great in Old Montreal and the buildings are gorgeous in this area  In fact I found it interesting that outside the hotel it said the building housed the first meeting of the YMCA over  years ago  The area is great with several bars and cafes in the area The hotel staff is very friendly and there is a bar area as well that gets lively at night  The room included free breakfast downstairs but both days I was busy so I never got to enjoy it  I spent  nights here and it was very comfortable  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Montreal  It was as good as the first year I went  
P => tough to beat Style and quality  spacious  idiosyncrasies of a boutique hotel delayed check in but a top flight hotel in a great part of the city  staff bar room appointments all superb  one of montreals finest in terms of value and personality  
P => I could live in this hotel   happily   forever  My husband and I visit the Hotel Gault every year  We have returned  years in a row  It is one of the most amazing properties Ive ever visited  As time has passed the hotel staff has not lost the attentiveness and attention to detail that makes it so special  The rooms are immaculately maintained and the furnishings show little or no wear  The staff go out of their way to make a stay comfortable and memorable  The Gault is close to so much yet it feels like a peaceful haven  Plus they serve the most divine breakfast I think I have ever consumed outside of my own home  I cannot wait to return there again this year 
P => So stylish My husband and I stayed in the quotEtceteraquot room at Hotel Gault last weekend and we absolutely loved it It wasnt like staying at a hotel at all it was like staying in your very own stylish modern loft style condo  The huge bath was an impressive touch  There was lots of closet space and just lots of space overall the room was huge  The staff were also very friendly  We went down to the lobby bar for a few drinks at happy hour and the tinis were very good  I had quotThe Gaultquot tini and my husband had a very subtle garita  Breakfast the next morning was complimentary and very good high quality fresh and delish Hotel Gault far exceeded our expectations and we will definitely go back soon  
P => The Gault was fantastic This was our first stay at the Hotel Gault and we were very pleased The staff were friendly and helpful at all times  Check in was a breeze  The room was well appointed  We had one of the corner quotExtraessentielquot rooms and it was very spacious  The shower was fantastic    so often hotel showers are such a disappointment but this one was luxurious in comparison given the size and water pressure The hotel is located in a beautiful old stone building yet the or inside is very contemporary  Our room was definitely quotminimalistquot in style yet very comfortable nonetheless The breakfast that came with the room was very nice  We had dinner one night in the lobby restaurant    the menu was very appealing and the food was great  We were very happy with our meal The hotel is nicely located  Close to all of the sights in Old Montreal yet easy walking distance to the shopping on Ste  Catherine  Fun thoroughfares such as St  Denis and St  Laurent are only three or four subway stops away Our only criticisms of the Hotel Gault are minor  These are minor quibbles and did not detract from the overall wonderful experience First the room came with two bath towels    extra towels would have been nice  We showered a couple of times each day and it would have been nice the second time not to have to use the same damp towel from the morning  I suppose we could have asked for extra towels but they should be provided as a matter of course as in most hotels of this caliber Second the room contained some fantastic looking modernist chairs which were in keeping with the chic contemporary or of the Hotel Gault  However they were not the most comfortable of chairs  After a day of exploring Montreal it would have been nice to sit back in a comfy chair and relax  I would not want over stuffed cliched hotel chairs but one does not have to sacrifice comfort for modernist and contemporary design  Next time they are upgrading the hotel furnishings the Gault management should consider chairs that are both chic and comfortable    such things do exist Finally and this is a problem with most hotels not just the Gault    it is the st century and the lack of a green program is inexplicable  The rooms did not even have blue bins for recycling  Unbelievable  Hotels like the Gault really need to start taking steps above and beyond self serving notes asking guests to re use towels to reduce their ecological footprint  
P => Top Notch Service I stayed at Hotel Gault in ember and I have nothing but good things to say  Firstly we arrived rather late and check in was quick and welcoming  We were introduced to the friendly and courteous hotel staff and were told a few things about the hotel  I asked for recommendations for the following evening for dinner as BYOW is something that lacks in Toronto  In the morning I was given  different options detailing locations their personal reviews crowd and varying cuisines yet all pertaining to my requests Excellent My room was quiet relaxing and more than inviting  I had a great night sleep and was up and ready to go after my free in room breakfast  A full a l  carte menu is included with free room service which was more than an added bonus as Montr al can leave you paralyzed the morning after The only thing I can say is that an LCD monitor would have been a nice added bonus but nonetheless the only issue I had No matter the request Hotel Gault went out there way for me   my friends and I agreed that we are pleased to have somewhere to stay when in Montreal  
P => A wonderful hotel  One of the nicest hotels Ive ever stayed in and Ive stayed in a lot  I fly  miles a year  Beautifully designed  Super friendly staff  Great food  A quothipquot hotel that makes you feel very welcome  Concierge desk staff etc  couldnt be nicer or more helpful  Older people  not think of it as quotluxuriousquot   no overstuffed chairs foo foo orations etc  But if you like modern design you cant beat it 
P => the best hotel experience ive had in montreal You  not like contemporary design I do and its one more reason I love this hotel  But even if you dont the level of service here is simply amazing and should make even the most modern design skeptic a lover of this hotel  My wife and I stayed in a suite with a private balcony a suite that easily eclipsed the size of our manhattan apartment All amenities you could ask for a well conceived design from top to bottom heated bathroom floors huge windows generous storage to hang suits unpack and really high quality linens  Notwithstanding how much I like the or of the hotel the staff and the professional level of service they provide are the main attraction in my opinion  Simply put they are helpful and dedicated to making your stay comfortable and pleasant  We arrived very late but the hotel staff were there to park the car and bring our luggage to our room  Im originally from Montreal and have seen a lot of the citys hotels when Ive come back to visit  This hotel really exceeded my experiences with other hotels  My wife and I are sure to return  
P => Modern and comfortable with excellent service We only stayed at the Hotel Gault for one night but it is deserving of a review  We arrived very late around  am but were still greeted with a warm and welcoming reception  After a quick and pleasant check in we were shown to our room  The room is large and sleek with more space for storing clothes luggage etc  than Ive seen in any other hotel  The bathroom was also very large and all of the furniture and or from the chairs to the drapes were modern and beautiful  We loved the long wooden desk and the concrete floors  We also loved the concrete walls in the hallway see attached photo and the view from our corner window was very nice  We ordered room service at  am and the food was excellent  An assortment of french cheeses with wine really hit the spot after our long day of driving  And again the service was spectacular  Check out was expedient and friendly and we left Hotel Gault wishing that we had more time to spend there  For those wishing to explore Old Montreal the hotels proximity to Basilique Notre Dame de Montr al and other attractions is perfect  
P => One of Best Boutique Hotels I spent several nights at the Hotel Galt in Old Montreal because it I had just finished attending a conference at McGill University and I wanted to stay in another part of Montreal  I had previously stayed at the Doubletree Plaza and Sheraton Le Centre  This property is located on the Western outskirts of Old Montreal but the property is close enough to work to most of Old Montreal  I even walked from the business district to this property During my stay in Montreal the weather was exceptional warm and dry  Check in was smooth I was escorted to my top floor room by the Galt Rep  who checked me in  She showed me all of the details of the room  I asked for the most quiet and sun filled room in the property when I made my online reservation  I received a discount rate by purchasing my rooms in advance  When I entered room the radiodvd player was playing classical music  The room was large with hip and super cool environment  The bed was comfortable Television had many channels and rotated around to living room and kitchnette section of the room  The bathroom could be sectioned off from the kitchenette and bed area or could be opened up to both areas  The bathroom featured arate room for the toliet  arate area for the bath tub and sink  arate shower The bathroom featured Molton Brown products which were all fine  Also bottled Galt water was provided on daily basis My rate included continental breakfast and one hot dish i e  eggs or crepes was very good  There is small gym in the basement  In old Montreal I recommend Sport Du Vieux casual dining Restaurant Du Vieux Port steakhouse with exceptional and friendly service and Restaurant Des Gouverrid Freinch cuisine I took the Greyline tour of Montreal and the tour company picked me up from the Hotel Galt  The day was sunny dry and pleasant The only issue I had with the property was the closet light did not operate and I did not mention this to the Galt Reps and it was not fixed during my staff  A couple of the Galt Reps were not friendly but most were fine I was satisfied with my stay at Galt Hotel because the Hotel amp room were Hip amp Super Cool  My room was comfortable amp quiet  Service is very good  If you are planning to spend some time in your room you can not go wrong with the Hotel Galt  I highly recommend this superb property in Old Montreal  
P => Very funky contemporary room Very private and comfortable   the windows opened so we could keep stuff cold outside it was ch  Did have some noise from drunk passersby late at night Other than that the brunch included was excellent  The room tastefully orated in a contemporary setting and the furnishings very nice   lots of room to spread out into with plenty of space for personal stuff  
P => Amazing service  loved the Gault Warm regards to the staff and management of the Hotel Gault  they were amazing and deserve much praise  From the bellman to the breakfast staff every person there was friendly kind concerned and helpful  When we were given a map the girl at the desk came right around and stood next to us indicating points of interest    no disinterested leaning over a map across a desk she cared  Umbrellas were readily available when the weather turned wet and they were of nice quality too  Of course The car was costly to park but I expect that in a busy city and they were most prompt in bringing it right up when asked  Good staff again   We were able to reserve a lovely huge room with a tub happy us  The room was vast and well appointed  some  not care for the ultra modern concrete floors and minimalist style but I loved it  Internet connection was fast and easy and the nightime chocolate was a nice touch The breakfast Lovely and beautifully served as well  Probably my best eggs Benedict ever now I am ruined for life    until I go back  First there is a nice buffet of cold items  meats cheeses breads fruits etc  then they take your hot order and make you very full and very happy So the Gault get best ks for service food rooms staff and location  As long as you like it cool and modern you will be very happy here  I prefer it to the Vogue which was also wonderful but less stylish and the staff at Gault was simply superb  Thank you Gault for a very nice stay 
P => Stylish This is a great hotel with not too many rooms and almost personal service  Great lobby staff rooms and location in the old town  Breakfast is great with buffet and hot meal  Highly reccomend this stylish hotel   large rooms too 
P => A friendly unpretentious luxury hotel Spacious comfortable nicely designed rooms  I stayed there with wife and three year old dhter it was an excellent choice  Staff were very child friendly and always very pleasant and helpful  The restaurant was excellent  Overall great value for a luxury hotel  
P => Very good hotel Good design very well located short walk to Old Montreal and Downtown Rooms very well equiped and comfortable however some of the chairs at the main hall cafe were not very clean Overall a very good option for a business or holiday stay  
P => Very pleasant stay We stayed for three nights in a spacious attractive room with a large terrace  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The breakfast included with the room was lovely  Great location  Highly recommended  
P => Sublime Stay We stayed for  nights and found Hotel Gault to be a sublime retreat  This exceptional hotel is centrally located for walking and near many great shops and restaurants  The rooms are serene retreats oversized with loft like open design and excellent ammenities  Theres a library living room bar and restaurant in the lobby  Staff members made us feel welcome and were always available to assist  After finishing a meal in the restaurant one evening the chef sent cookies to our table that he had baked at home that morning 
P => Great Boutique Hotel I am sitting in Room  as I write this review  We have a semi private balcony  The room is very contemperary But we have liked it for a change from the other hotels weve been to in Canada  The staff downstairs is very helpful  Continental breakfast is great  I would highly recomend this hotel  
P => Cool I stayed for two nights in mid y  and had a great experience  The staff was fantastic  The room was uber comfortable and really unique  It was quite modern so if thats not your thing and you prefer an old wrought iron bed and antiques in the room then look elsewhere  I was thrilled with my room    it was large the high ceilings and long curtains behind the bed were dramatic it had free internet access and the bathroom was great  It was a tad further away from the center of old Montreal than some of the other boutique hotels but no big deal  
P => Very impressed We usually stayed at the Fairmont QE in Montreal but on account of the great reviews that this hotel has received we ided to give it a try  And we got a good deal with their tasty promo Had the extraessential  room that is a corner room with lots of space Everyone we dealt with was super friendly and courteous Received turndown both nights  No problem there Room was made up by housekeeping while we were out  Did a good job cleaning Had dinner at the hotel restaurant came with room  Wonderful food and good service Breakfast both days  Good selection and included eggs or crepes made to order Location is good  Two blocks at most from subway entrance which connects to underground world in Montreal  Very convenient especially when it rained the way it did when we were there On a quiet street but right next to busy places like St  Paul Street with all the bars and stuff  So room and street noise was a non issue Room only one phone  Very surprised  And not cordless No coffeemaker in room  I really dont like that Otherwise everything was great Agreed with previous poster that bare floors seemed strange  But it wasnt bad  And the bathroom floor was heated We will definitely stay here again  I am VERY surprised but I like this more than I do the QE  
P => Something missing We stayed at the Gault at the end of e and while we had a pleasant experience something seemed to be lacking a certain attention to detail  Sometimes we did not receive the turndown service for example  Also the rooms have a lot of bare concrete floor which is not pleasing to bare feet cold and sort of scuffed up and dirty looking  I thought this would not be annoying since the Gault website indicates that slippers are provided but alas there were none to be had  We received an excellent restaurant recommendation from the staff but also got some misinformation as well  So I would have to agree with the previous poster that attention to some of the service related details seems a bit off The general quotvibequot of the hotel is rather young   somethings guests and staff alike so I think that what was also lacking for me was a feeling of being a bit out of place  As I look at the reviews here on TA it seems like the younger crowd really takes to the hotel while some of those older are more lukewarm      We had dinner at the Nelligan one night and felt more at home there as forty somethings  
P => Was great now only good    What the heck happened to this lovely hotel Has it become a victim of its success We stayed here in y  and were very pleasantly surprised  We enjoyed the hotel and the service immensely  Flash forward one year and the results werent so positive  First the positives The rooms are huge and unique  The bathrooms are super large especially the ones with the tubs and showers  The front desk people are very friendly and helpful so much so that we hate to complain  My wife loved the breakfasts which are included The negatives Where to begin The raisinet I accidentally dropped on the floor on the first day was still there on the third  Yuck The room wasnt made until  pm one day even though the quotmake up the roomquot sign was on the door from  am to  pm  And they only cleaned the room after we called concerned that the maid had died or something  They only give you one bath towel per person unless you call for more  The empty tissue box placed strategically on the night table was not replaced even though it was empty  Had to call the front desk after sneezing  The TV picture was snowy and required fixing  Theres no alarm clock or phone books in the rooms  We had to wait  minutes for our valeted car because we were told they were understaffed  Large functions held in the lobby each night were intrusive Management should consider this a wake up call  Train your room staff to clean rooms better and hire enough people to maintain your four stars  Or drop a star and lower your rates  
P => Would return to Hotel Gault in a hearbeat Just to second a lot of the other reviews on TripAdvisor we had two great experiences at Hotel Gault  We have made two long weekend trips to Montreal and found Hotel Gault to be perfect for us for both stays  The location size of the hotel small service and design were all fabulous Location is right in the heart of Old Montreal and near a subway station  Service is always wonderful consierge spent considerable amount of time helping us find restaurants make reservations and printing out maps for us  My husband loves modern design and was loving Hotel Gault with the polished cement flooring and other such touches  Breakfast is included in the stay and is above and beyond my expecations for a free breakfast made to order eggs benedict lox omlet etc  So good that we ate there every morning before heading out for the day Needless to say as we already have been there twice wed return again a third time  
P => Gault ultra modern ok stay Stayed at Gault for weekend getaway with my husband  We frequent Old Montreal several times a year for vacation and business  Found Hotel Gault to be just okay   We booked a room to find that it only had a shower  Had to pay extra to upgrade to suite with tub  The suite was modern and very different   Balcony is big and private if you book the best suite otherwise you share your balcony  The curtains made of organza were torn and the whole place had an office feel to it  Nothing warm or inviting  Breakfast was good and the coffee was hot  Overall Id say there are better places to stay in Old Montreal and Hotel Gault is only so so in my books  
P => Very nice Stayed at The Gault in a king room on third floor  Very funky and nice  Bedroomliving area curtained off from dressing and bathroom area  Toilet in closet like space with sliding door and shower next to it with clear door  Sink outside both  Platform bed nice and comfy with a duvet cover  We booked through the hotels website and it included one dinner  They have a prix fixe menu for meals too  Presentation was great food was good  Free brkfst very nice too  Ordered omelet from the kitchen to supplement the breads and salads offered  Parking is CAD per night  Its in Old Montreal and quite a walk to the downtown area  We did it with no problem but we like to walk  A few museums are nearby but beware of dog poop all over the sidwalks  Noon check out is much appreciated The staff seems to be younger people s and they were very willing to get you anything you need  Friendly and courteous too Building was built in  as the first YMCA in North America plate outside building says so  I would stay here again but would also consider a hotel a little north and few blocks to the west to be closer to the downtown area  Note The non Canada resident tax refund program is ending at the end of ch  If you do the refund at the airport as you are leaving you can get cash  
P => Great stay at the Gault I stayed at the Gault with my boyfriend for two nights at the end of ember   It is by far the best hotel I have visited   point of comparison are the Place dArmes in Montreal the Germain in Toronto and the Dominion  in Quebec city  The design is absolutely outstanding  The room was very big  The FLOU bed was extremely comfortable and so were the duvet and pillows The heated floor in the bathroom was well eciated  The DVD player in the room was useful to watch our dvds   check out the dvd selection in the lobby   and so was the internet connection in the room The complimentary breakfast was a nice surprise as you could order great hot breakfast from the kitchen and not just a continental breakfast  The staff was courteous and discreet Overall a charming and romantic experience  I highly recomend it  
P => A pleasure We just spent the better part of a week at the Hotel Gault in Montreal celebrating our th wedding anniversary and our postive experiences at this hotel and in Old Montreal have left us with such a memorable and joyful celebration  As in Paris we always prefer a small boutique hotel and with only  diverse rooms in the Hotel Gault we became acquainted with the friendly competent courteous and professional staff and in all of our interactions with them we all shared a genuine personal touch to all of our activities  From the time we made our reservations by phone and until we left by taxi to the airport every staff member chefs to attendants made every encounter a pleasant experience  Our quiet quottop quot room was impecably cleaned each day excellent toiletries we were also provided with a hand written weather report for the next day along with bottled water on the nightstand  With the excellent location of the Hotel Gault we leisurely walked or took the metro everywhere without fear or safety concerns and appreciated the non destructive humanity of the people of this fine city  The majority of our purchases consisted of items art to clothing that were creations of local artists and we never felt cheated or eived in our discussions and purchases  When we return to Montreal we will also return to the Hotel Gault and expect to again enjoy all the courtesies the enthusiastic staff provided to us  
P => Perfect again Hotel Gault is simply great  It was our second stay there and it hasnt missed a beat in the  years since our first visit  Gault now serves lunch and dinner to go along with the included breakfast that they have always offered  ReceptionWe arrived at pm and our room was not yet ready pm check in so we left our vehicle at the curb they checked our bags for us and then took our vehicle to the car park  We have a full sized SUV so it had to be parked a block away in a larger garage  Parking was CADnt  My wife and I walked around Rue St  Paul and grabbed a quick lunch and returned to the hotel at pm to find that our room was ready  We were then escorted to our room to find that our bags awaited us in the room The RoomWe booked a corner room  The corner rooms are very spacious with the heated concrete bathroom floors huge shower with Grohe fixtures and minimalist furniture  The queen sized bed was comfortable and the rooms contain an ironing board iron hairdryer workstation flat screen TV with DVD player movies available in the lobby and a compact audio system DiningThe dinner was incredible  A very small and modern menu that reflects the ambience of the hotel  The dining space is small and quiet and the tables overlook gaslit Rue St  Helene  Breakfast is also excellent  Theres a cold buffet offering with fresh fruit baked goods and juices  There are also choices from the kitchen such as omelets with bacon and hash browns  LocationThe hotel is a bit far from the downtown core  Its walkable for us but its a mostly uphill trek to get to St  Catherines St  Your only a block from the Metro and therefore a block to the underground pedestrian passageways so once you get a handle of the maps of the underground you can save yourself time and effort navigating the city  Hotel Gault is just  streets from Rue St  Paul and a  minute walk to Bonsecours and Place Jaques Cartier  Also the Bell Center is approx  a  minute walk but just a couple of Metro stops away  
P => Wonderful Stay at the Gault Everything about the hotel was great We booked a loft suite which was a good size very clean with neat furniture  The bathroom was incredible especially liked the big bathtub and heated floors  Service was excellent   nothing like leaving your car at the front door and not being bothered with ticket stubs to keep track of  When we needed the car we just called the front desk and asked for it   no problems at all  The breakfast which was included was fantastic   eggs benedict crepes whatever you want The lobby bar was cozy and friendly with wireless internet if you bring your laptop  We booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed at all  Stay here you wont be sorry 
P => Its my favorite hotel This is my favorite hotel in the world  Its got very modern clean spare lines so if that is not your taste you might not like it  Service is impeccable and location is great for going to other spots in old Montreal  
P => Modern This hotel is in the same category as W Montreal amp Hotel Nelligan  Both very modern sleeck upscale and hip  The room is very bare with the essentials  They seem not to provide enough clean towels wash towels and etc  I had to ask for more  The water chips and chocolates in the room were unked with prices  So I didnt know if they were complimentary or not     hence I didnt touch them You can hear noices from upstairs and next door very easily  All rooms seems to have very high ceilings  All with views of the surrounding buildings  The hotel is only  stories high so dont expect any spectacular views of anything The breakfast was good which was complimentary and included waffles and order of eggs if you wanted  All the staffs were friendly and helpful  The beds were extremely confortable  The room was clean and modern  At the summer promotional rate of  its hard to go wrong at this hotel  But I believe rates are usually around  which I think  be a bit too expensive when comparing to the W Hotel  Not sure if it justifies that price rate    its no four seasons and definitely does not have all the amenties to justify that price  
P => Outstanding Stayed  nights in an Etcetera room  Very nice large room with CD DVD wireless and LAN flat screen TV great bed  Bathroom was very nice with heated floors erate shower and large bathtub  Service was excellent and staff were very helpful  Breakfast buffet had good choices  Overall an excellent luxury boutique hotel in a great old city location  Wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  Only minus is only  machines in the gym  That said I never had to wait to use the treadmill    
P => Good but not the best Okay folks the Hotel Gault is a great hotel but I dont understand this hype with all the quotbest luxury hotelquot  The hotel Nelligan down the street has more amenities and their ambience is much more inline with the luxury theme same price  I enjoyed staying at Gault and the price is right   night  But I was disappointed by having no drawers to put my clothes in and the amenities were very basic  If you can get the same price at Nelligan or Le Place de Armes then were talking luxury  
P => nearly perfect I met up with a group of friends for a long weekend in Montreal  We all stayed at the Gault  The staff was wonderful Andre the concierge gave us great recommendations for restaurants and sights to visit  We were always greeted with a smile when we stepped in the front door or off the elevator and their only answer to a question was quotyesquot  As others have said the beds are very comfortable and the or and furnishings are warm modern  The hotel is beginning to show a bit of wear scraped elevator and room doors a patch of paint missing by our soaking tub and scuff ks on the room floor  Not a complaint just an observation  I would not hesitate to stay at the Gault again  
P => fantastic hotel i am just returning from a two day business trip in Canada and can not say enough about this hotel  The rooms are excellent mine had a roof top terrace and a heated bath room floor  The furnishing strickly Knoll and the bed was the best  The location is central and the design superb  The food was ok and the drink pours are small but the staff incredible  Ther are only  rooms so everyone is treated like a true guest I can not wait to return 
P => Excellent great service and great value Stayed at the lovely hotel gault recently  Well worth it  Was there for a long weekend with my partner and the staff could not have been nicer Room was cool without being overdone  Stay on the top floor with the terrace if you can swing it  Breakfast in room was lovely But mostly the staff were so very nice and helfpul  
P => Best Luxury Modern Hotel Experience   Excellent My husband and I just returned from our Honeymoon stay at the Hotel Gault  I have to say the entire experience was fabulous This is by far one of the best modern luxury hotels we have stayed at thus far  We travel around the globe frequently and have not come across an establishment that can truly be given an excellent rating in all categories  The Hotel is very clean rooms are spacious all necessary amenities included breakfast was great and the staff was extremely accomodating  I would have to say that the staff was on the same level as a stay at a Four Seasons Hotel  The location is very convenient and within walking distance to all of the major sites shopping and dining  I highly recommend this hotel You will not be disappointed  
P => Merci beaucoup Living on the north shore of Montreal I heard and read many good things about the Gault so i ided to try it for one night  Was there    to celebrate my wife  th birthday and loved every minute of our stay  My wife and I were pleasently surprised by all the attention and service we got from the moment we arrived to the time we left  Our room was on the top floor   very modern confortable and clean  Great view from our balcony all those architectural details on old buildings that you miss from ground level  Included in the price of the room is a brunch witch we specially enjoyed the quality and variety is unbelievable and it is served in the lobby  They make good cofee I think its their specialty  If you want to impress somebody this is the place  Carole et Michel 
P => Perfection We stayed at the Gault from  to  and absolutely loved every minute of it  All the previous post have been right on  The hotel is just beautiful on the outside and so modern on the inside  The hotel staff were so wonderful and extremely friendly really made you feel welcomed  Our room was so clean and roomy  The bed was so comfy one of the best hotel beds I ever slept in  Loved the heated floors in the bathroom and the shower wow The continental breakfast was an absolute delight especially the waffles  It was so nice sitting in the dining area having breakfast overlooking the streets of old Montreal just lovely  The location is convenient to the metro just a short walk  We just loved walking in old Montreal so romantic  We would definitely stay here again it really made our vacation special  I highly recommend the Gault  
P => A very good hotel I think a dose of realism is required here so let me try to give a balanced review  I read ALL of the reviews and from doing so its easy to expect some kind of heaven on earth here  But a modern  room hotel in the centre of a city like Montreal is unlikely to be THAT good it just isnt possible  Having said that Ive still given it  stars because its not far off as good as it could be and the things that are not perfect dont knock it down to  stars  We are fairly fussy  We stayed at various small inns on our  night trip all with several  star reviews on Tripadvisor and one very expensive hotel at Mont Tremblant  The Gault is a very good place to stay in Montreal  The location is good Andre is a very personable and helpful guide  We said what we wanted and he booked us  excellent meals   Chez LEpicier very good food in imaginative dishes in the old town The Globe a scene restaurant with a ridiculously noisy DJ waitresses who look like models and very good food and the best   O Chalet a new restaurant with a funny s camping theme which could have been tacky but actually was rather stylish and the food absolutely superb  Once place we found on our own was for excellent brunch   Le Cartet  Mc Gill Our room was mid range its admittedly very modern here minor criticism but it did have excellent ameneties   a lovely bed wired free internet access wifi doesnt work too well through concrete walls excellent shower funky storage  Breakfast is a very good buffet but the chairs and tables are not the most practical minor criticism  The staff are all very friendly and helpful  The location is fine  Ive got to say we were rather disappointed with Montreal perhaps its over hyped  The best things we found were various interesting structures   the Geodesic Dome on the island right out of science fiction the sports stadium you cant miss it if you go up to Mont Royal just look for the spaceship a building around the corner from the hotel made of coloured glass the industrial buildings and ships down at the docks  Anyway if youre staying in Montreal this is a very good hotel  If I was going again Id probably look at other reviews on Tripadvisor but might end up back at the Gault anyway since you cant go wrong there  Hope this helps  
P => Perfection in Montreal I have traveled all over the world and stayed in many high end hotels and can unequivically put the Hotel Gault easily in my top  of hotel experiences  This was my first visit to Montreal and while I loved the city I didnt want to leave my room I dont want to re hash what everyone else has said about this great boutique hotel and I agree with all the positive comments so I will just give my personal bullet points  The staff is genuinely friendly and caring  probably the nicest staff I have ever encountered  They all know your name and treat you like family  They are very gay friendly and welcoming to all  The loby at first glance seems spare and minimalist but gradually shows its true warmth and comfort  The breakfast is excellent  they will make you anything you desire quotfreequot with room  Nice little bar for a cappucino or a preprandial libation and they serve Voss water  my favorite  Spend the extra  for one of the quotessential top fivequot rooms  private quiet and your own balcony  While I missed the soaking tub that is in some of the other rooms the balcony and views made up for it  The room was very NY loft like but very quothomey quot The bed was great and the linens superb  Great mini sound system and lots of storage space  Loved the heated bathroom floor which can set by you  Superior sound control  NO city or neighbor noise  I stayed in  and never wanted to leave Great location close to old Montreal and great restaurants  Go have a drink and the elegant room in the St  James and either of the two bars of the W both short distance walking  Remember   wine is VERY VERY expensive   times the price in the states  I carried a few bottles with me from the US because of this  but splurge for a glass of Champagne in the St James bar  beautiful and elegant dont miss the deal at quothappy hourquot drinks and appetizer pairings for  CA Another thing not to miss is pizza on Youville St at Pizzaiolle sp  A bit of a walk but worth it is Restaurant Cavali  authentic and heavenly Italian fare  Hotel Gault is the only place I would stay in Montreal and cant wait to go back  You will love it 
P => Spectacular My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Gault for a weekend in Montreal and were completely blown away  The outside was stunning the lobby and common areas were very friendly and relaxed and our room was very modern amp sleek lots of exposed concrete amp steel king bed two curtains arating the bedroom from the bathroom comfy chairs great patio style doors opening to iet balconies etc  There was a DVD player in the room and DVDs downstairs in the living room which you could borrow free LAN connection in the room free wi fi access in the lobby and a free well   included in the price of the room breakfast better than what youd find in most cafes  Its on a little street two minutes from Place DArmes and two minutes from a metro station so both quiet and convenient The staff were professional and relaxed at the same time and happily did everything we asked of them gave us great suggestions for places to eat like Holder a very good resto pub around the corner on McGill pointed out interesting things to see in the city let us use their computer to print out our boarding passes let us sprawl in their lobby even after wed checked out   all without any of the pretention or aloofness that you get from many high end hotels I cant imagine a better hotel experience  I cant imagine staying anywhere else in Montreal either  
P => A fine balance Over the last six months my team and I have tried eight high end hotels in Montreal  I do not pretend to speak for them this is purely my view  But I do feel passionately that this is one of the better hotels I have stayed at The lobby has an open well designed but homely feel  The concierge took time to explain individual features about each of our rooms there are only  in the whole hotel  The library seems to be a particularly comfortable place for meetings  Though they are a little light on the books but make up for it with the videomagazine selection Each room is unique  I found mine had an excellent blend of design and warmth despite the minimalist effort that had been put into it Service is excellent overall  Attention paid to detail   helps when there so few rooms  The only thing I found annoying was the air conditioning despite being quiet could not be turned off at night  Excellent bed very good pillows  
P => Disappointed After having read all the wonderful reviews I was expecting my stay at the Gault to be the quotsummitquot of a two week Canada trip  However I was rather disappointed both by certain aspects of the room and by the service  This has been the only time that I have disagreed so significantly with the Tripadvisor rating Room problems several lights didnt work the safe was broken the toilet seat was about to break amp there were no clothes hangers at all strange for a luxury hotelService problems the people at reception and at breakfast were very friendly  BUT I was not so thrilled with the overbearing attentions of the concierge Andr  for many travelers advice on restaurants and extended anecdotes on the city  be welcome but that advice shouldnt be forced on more independent minded travelers who know the city  At one point I resorted to running away when he approached me for the umpteenth time At the end of our Canada trip I found that both the Germain in Toronto and the Auberge St Antoine in Qu bec City were superior hotels with regard to service amp accommodation  
P => Didnt like it I dont understand all these rave reviews  I stayed here last ch and apart from being locked in the bathroom for fifteen minutes due to a faulty lock this hotel is very basic and totally overrated  The chairs in the rooms are like office chairs very uncomfortable and you could not watch tv from the bed as it didnt swivel  Staff were not overly concerned about my locked in problem and only offered minor compensation  Breakfasts and location are good thats about it  No one to help bring luggage in on arrival I prefer the St James as do the Rolling Stones 
P => By far the best hotel in Montreal in Canada and possibly the world  Hello as a seasoned traveler for both business and pleasure I just had to write and say that this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at  The rooms are modern but very cozy with every amenity you could ever need and more  However what truly makes a hotel is the staff and service  The Gault staff is most courteous professional congenial and polite group of people I have ever done business with  They were so polite and treated my wife with such attention and respect that we were both almost embarrassed by how polite and helpful these people were  I am definitely going back  One tip though the room rate can be a little pricey so I strongly suggest that you book online in advance and take advantage of their online deals which often enough are at   off the regular rack rates  Five stars 
P => Simply the best Dont waste time looking any further  Book here you will not be disappointed  Perfect location for Old Montreal  Perfect stay  
P => Classic Stay Classy Staff We went to a wedding and stayed at this beautiful hotel in Montreal  We highly recommend it  At first glance the lobby and its modern furniture makes you think you are going to be in a very quotstuffyquot and quothipsterquot place  But the Hotel Gault is not like that at all  The staff is so warm and inviting that you end up wanting to stay there foreverThe furnishings are very modern rooms are huge the breakfastbrunch is delicious and very healthy  The lobby serves as a restaurant for lunch and breakfast and as a quiet bar at night   We especially loved the heated floors in the hotel rooms  Most all the rooms had balconies some balconies were larger than others  Most balconies were narrow which meant that you could not sit on the balconies  However the windows were huge and elegant with beautiful flower boxes  The breeze that came through added to the wonderful environment in the room  We were quite impressed with the staff  They made our stay at Hotel Gault so pleasant  Well definitely go back there for a visit 
P => Perfect This hotel was amazing Friendly and helpful staff  Great location  Fabulous room  Would stay there again in a heartbeat  
P => One of the best boutique hotels in the world I have actually stayed in this hotel  times over the past several years  I first went shortly after they opened  I have traveled all around the world on over  international trips in  years all vacation  This hotel is head and shoulders above most hotels I have been to  Its ultra cool and has excellent amenities  More importantly the staff is amazing and goes the extra mile  The last time I went I remember that I called down to ask if they could recommend any places that delivered food  They gave me some phone numbers  I asked about one of the restaurants and they didnt have a menu so they went down the street to go get one Also I had to mail some letters and didnt have stamps but offered to buy some stamps  Again they didnt have any stamps there but offered to mail them for free  The room I stayed in was great  Once I stayed in a quotStudioquot and another I stayed in the quotetceteraquot and the other the quotTerraquot  All were great  The breakfast buffet in the morning was really great  They were always very friendly about directions parking and the service was head and shoulders better than most places  One night I had a date with a girl I met and I went to buy a bottle of champagne  Someone that came in for the turndown service noticed it and immediately offered to bring a bucket with ice and even brought champagne flutes up  I ended up leaving an expensive Prada belt in the room when I left and I expected it to be long gone  I called and they said that the cleaning lady found it  They immediately Fed exed it to my office the next day I cant recommend this hotel enough  When I go back to Montreal I wouldnt stay anywhere else  mike apartmentsba com 
P => Impeccable terrific and suave The Gault is the real deal when it comes to service and cool  I spent  nights there for a long conference and every night spent in the Gault was a treat  They are THE NICEST staff I have ever encountered in any hotel in the world and I have stayed in over  countries  Special kudos to the front desk for remembering our names every time we came in the door  Be careful what rooms you get  We were in the best rooms in the hotel but some are small on the bottom floors  Splurge for the fourth or fifth floor rooms  The modern or is way cool and very welcoming very modern but incredibly comfortable  The only nit I would pick is the ridiculous chairs for the dining area  They nearly killed three people while I was there so watch out for tripping  The rate includes breakfast and all the various coffee drinks you can consume  Remember to order off the menu for breakfast  If you like your eggs American standard ask for your omelette well done otherwise they are a bit wet keep in mind a breakfast like this would set you back at least  CAD elsewhere  Use your tub if you get one its way cool after a busy day of shopping  Go shopping on Ste Catherine street especially in the higher end shops  There are some real treasures  The Gault is one of the finest hotels I have stayed in bar none  Not a grand hotel in that tradition but warm welcoming people make it the experience you should not miss in Montreal  Magnifique 
P => Exceptional Just got back from a wonderful  day stay  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  The staff is super  Andre the concierge goes beyond efforts to help you even taking you outside the building to point out directions  That is not to say the rst of the staff is not just as helpful  The rooms are modern yet comfortable  We had a terra room which has a bathroom as big as some of the hotel rooms I have been in  The area is quiet and you actually can walk to downtown  The breakfast is something to look forward to each morning   make sure you order from the kitchen  The only drawback is housekeeping    turndown service is sporadic  They tend to come just when one is getting ready for dinner and when sent away they never return  There is no need to look anywhere else for a stay in Montreal  
P => What a perfect spot   could never stay anywhere else again I have travelled often in my life though have never before felt compelled to write a review of any of my accomodations  I hesitate now only because I wish to keep this gem to myself   however since the beans have already been spilled I will elaborate on the beauty of the Gault  What a magnificant retreat The lobby is sleek but not unwelcoming the staff warm and incredibly attentive to any needs  They readily provided directions made reservations and answered all of our questions  Service at the front desk and at the bar was efficient and thorough  The rooms are spacious and quiet and the bed is rekable  Never have I slept so well while away from home All the luxuries and creature comforts one could want for while away from home were provided from the lush bathrobes to the umbrella hanging thoughtfully in the wardrobe  Breakfast is included in the room rate and for an additional  can be had in the room  It was a delight each morning  I could never stay anywhere in Montreal again   I am already searching for an excuse to find myself back at the Gault 
P => Gault is Great We just returned from  fabulous nights at the Hotel Gault  We were  couples s looking to let loose and eat drink and sightsee our way around the city We loved our quotloftquot style King room with high ceilings beautiful fabrics and tasteful furnishings   very chic Our very large bathroom included a tub big enough for two a arate water closet and a glass enclosed shower  The radiant heated floor was a nice touch for the chilly mornings  Housekeeping was wonderful and we never had ANY issues  Bathroom amenities were perfect towels were fluffy and a robe was provided   nothing was lacking  The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Old Montreal  Notre Dame is right down the street and we were able to find numerous bars restaurants and bistros right in the area   far too many choices for a weekend  We particularly enjoyed Boris Bistro for dinner around the corner on McGill and the Cobalt Bar and the Nelligan Hotel for cocktails on St  Paul  However if you want to venture further concierge is more than willing to offer up suggestions and ideas  They will even print various restaurant menus off the internet for you  The small bar at the Gault is perfect for a cocktail at the beginning or end of your night we did both  There is also a nice fireplace arating the receptionbar area and a comfortable reading room in the back  The Gault has tons of DVDs for rent and lots of booksmagazines to peruse if youre hanging out on the couches  As mentioned in the other reviews   the breakfast was awesome A beautiful buffet selection is offered daily along with a made to order choices  The food and service was top notch all the way  Its a nice touch that the entire breakfast is included in the room rate  If you eat too much at breakfast there is a small health club in the basement with a good treadmill an elliptical and some free weights   just enough to sneak in a quick  minute workout  The metro station is very close to the Gault and a good way to move around the city  We used the Metro  the time and then relied on short taxi rides in the evening   never more than  to get us from point A to point B  I cannot express enough how friendly the staff was during our entire stay They should be proud of the impression they made on the  of us We will return  
P => very good place Read all the reviews on this site which helped us select the Gault  We stayed in a Studio one of the largest options  Very clean extremely modern  We are not modern furniture people but felt it would be fun for a change  If you are really into this type of look this place would be fantastic for you  Lots of new stuff but also valuable stuff from the s s and s  The bed is incredibly comfortable  We loved our bathroom which for us included a tub Our studio had a mini fridge wet bar and microwave  The living area was erated from the bedroom by a custom built wood piece which did not reach the ceiling but was really more of a divider  The TVDVD was located on that on a swivel that could face either room area  If you want something supremely cushy and comfy this is not your place  OUr studio was wonderful but not the most Cozy thing we have stayed in  Having said that it was fun to try something different on since we are huge antique people  The lobby is terrific  Neat bar and surrounding area  Breakfasts were very good and we found that we ordered the hot breakfast items every morning  Service very gracious there expecially if you remember that although it is free the server deserves a tip  Things were replenished regularly  The Gault is on the edge of Old Montreal  get your bearings so you dont miss the busier streets of Old Montreal  The staff was enormously friendly  Also take the hotels address and number with you if you are taking cabs  Not all of the drivers have discovered the Gault yet  We LOVED Andre  He has genuine passion for the hotel and the area  But all the front deskconcierge folks were very professional and friendly and helpful  We had no problems with housekeeping  Left our room put out the sign and when we came back it was all set  Its true they dont change the linens every day but why tax the environment with the extra soap and hot water  If we threw towels on the floor they were replaced  If we hung them they were not  Fine with us  We ordered drinks and apps room service  quick and efficient  Husband forgot his razor brought one up  Staff always inquired as to whether we enjoyed a recommended restaurant etc  We can only give this place high ks but most especially because of the people who work there  
P => Cest Super The other trip advisor reviews do not lie  This is a real find  Everyone on the staff was so accomodating i every way  The room had minimal or but the amazing bed and comfy linens made up for it nice shower and bathroom too  The breakfast was out of this world dont miss the French toast or the croissants  The Gault tinis at the bar were fantastic Great location we walked everywhere I cant say enough good things about this hotel  Feel free to email me with other questions  
P => Fantastic hotel What can I add to the other reviews My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and wish we could have stayed longer  The minimalist room is be not to everyones taste but we liked it nonetheless it had everything that you could possibly need including the heated bathroom floor Breakfast was excellent and for those of you that find the normal North American pancakes too stodgy their crepes are delicious thin and ever so slightly crispy  The best aspect of the hotel was the service though for such a quotcoolquot hotel you would expect an air of pretentiousness far from it the staff are extremely polite and will do their best to cater to your every whim  Andr  knows everything there is to know about Montr al including the all important restaurants and attrations and will send you to all the right places especially those just off the beaten track  Should we ever return to Montr al we will definitely look this hotel up again  
P => The Best What can I say what a hotel we loved the place  Service the best weve had in a hotel Breakfast was a fantastic selection of hotcold plates room was massive with all one would require in it bathroom likewise  Located in the Old Port area easy to get to many attractions and lots of restaurants etc  But what makes a place is its staff and they were all superb   When I needed to use a computer and did not have one on my honeymoon they supplied a laptop to us for free for as long as we needed it and they have a great wi fi connection in the lobby  A great hotel in a great city we chose it because of the reviews in Tripadvisors  Well be back       
P => My favorite hotel  anywhere Design meets comfort  Staff makes you feel like youre home  They are truly the best  The hotel doesnt really have a restaurant they have a kitchen  A kitchen that makes fabulous tasty food  wonderful breakfasts a nice little bar downstairs  Just what you need to be comfortable nothing you dont  The rooms are clean modern well equipped but so so comfortable  I travel here for business have tried the Vogue Le Germain St  Paul but have come back here now for two years but I would definitely bring my spouse back here for a weekend getaway  Only drawback is you have to walk a little for restaurantsstores but not far and its a neat old neighborhood and of course the staff is always willing to give you a good steer  Le Gault cest magnifique 
P => Housekeeping on strike Just returned from four nights at the Gault  While the staff breakfast and location were great housekeeping was a disaster  We checked in to find clipped toenails on the floor and hairs in the shower  Despite requests with the front desk to have our room serviced late morningearly afternoon housekeeping would show up at  PM daily a time when we and most guests were resting up and showering before going out for the evening  Used glasses were never replaced an empty tissue box not replaced sheets on the bed not changed unless requested  paint peeling from the shower ceiling  This was in a night suite  I would expect better at a Motel   Never again 
P => Hidden Jewel The room was outstanding  Very quiet good location for exploring Montreal  Excellent breakfast  Staff really courteous and helpful  Andre the Concierge had excellent suggestions for shopping and restaurants  We cant wait to go back 
P => Vive le Gault My family just spent  nights at the Gault  This is one mod little hotel that earns its good reviews  This boutique property is fun stylish well located for leisure visitors and unlike so many other trendy hotels of the moment it hits on all the key hospitality cylinders without a single backfire  Our room was spacious with an extra comfy kingsize bed and a rollaway for ior  The design element is big here so if you like modern the Gault is going to be to your taste  Minimalist or but cozy and bright  Breakfast is a treat as many other reviewers have noted  Service is attentive and friendly but not obtrusive  The Gault pays attention to all the little details that can make or break a hotel stay  It is consistently just a little better than you might expect and the knowledgeable staff pulls it off with composure and elan  Highly recommended  
P => Five star service at four star prices We got the first of several pleasant surprises at check in when we learned that we had been upgraded to a suite complete with wraparound terrace with no increase in rate  We loved everything well almost everything about the Hotel Gault the clever open plan design in our suite the magnificent breakfasts the luxurious deep bathtub and most of all the friendly helpful professional staff special mention to Caroline customer service superstar  The hotel is extraordinarily well located in the historic district but also on the edge of downtown Montreal  Only minor peeve although there is excellent wi fi service in the lobby we had problems with the high speed internet connection in our room  
P => Slick but Warm and Toasty Really a great hotel  Rooms are comfortable and huge  Love the bed and huge tub  Daily breakfast was great  leisuregreat offerings and could read numerous papers or watch ET or Nemo on the flat screen tv  Staff is very nice and the location is great for strolling aroundshopping or getting a bite to eat  Only thing I thought was strange when I was there was the entrance and lack of staff helping you get your bags up the stairs or holding the door open  not a big deal for a smaller hotel but something I noticed  The streets can be a bit noisy as there was lots of contruction going on when I was there and the heated cement floors will pop and crack quite loudly after turning them up or off  Most people I am sure would not notice this  as I am a light sleeper  They did a really nice job with everything  Restaurant called AREA around the way is absolutely excellent 
P => best hotel ive ever been in  the service was wexcellent   professional hotel people who tired to serve the guest   from the first moment i came in after a lousy cab ride and the guy at the desk said   would you like to sit and relax and have a cafe while we get your room ready   everybody there had the same attitude  and then the physical feature   although ultra moderne and i was a little bit nervous about that   it turns out that everything wasd provided and the comfort level was high  
P => Our Best Hotel Experience Ever    My wife and I have travelled to many places here in Canada the United States and Europe and Hotel Gault was without a doubt our most enjoyable hotel experience to date  The service is in a word exceptional  The front desk staff were always genuinely friendly helpful and went out of their way to make us feel as if we were the only guests at the hotel  For example one morning after breakfast my wife and I commented on how we liked the look of furniture in the lobby  Without hesitation the concierge called up the owner of the hotel to find out who designed it then successfully located a local Montreal store which carried it and provided us with a map on how to get there so we could check it out  What impressed us most about this was that my wife and I are by no means big shots  We re both around  years old and got a package deal on the internet and ided to splurge a little  Yet the staff treated us as very special guests in a completely genuine and sincere way  I can t emphasise this enough  The breakfast was superb as was the or in the rooms  Our king bed provided us with a more restful and comfortable sleep then we get at home If you want the definitive quotboutique hotelquot experience this is it  Go and enjoy 
P => Gault is a Gem Three college friends met for a long weekend in Montreal and we were treated to a wonderful stay at Hotel Gault  This boutique hotel is clean modern and chic  Everything about it far exceeded our expectations  great location clean and very chic delicious breakfast  And the service is exceptional  The staff are knowledgable friendly and very helpful especially Andre who was there before we even realized we needed his help I would absolutely return and I have already recommended this little gem of a hotel  
P => Outstanding Surprised my wife for her birthday with a weekend trip to Montreal  We stayed at the Gault after I made an exaustive search of the hotel scene  Just an incredible place  I am fortunate to have visited many a fine hotel worldwide and found this gem to be spectacular in every detail  Staff and service was sterling  The breakfast in the lobby is not to miss  The design and furnishings are incredible  Very minimalistic modern yet very comfortable  The room is an architectural dream  Perfect location in the old town of Montreal  No attention to detail has been spared  I cant rave enough  
P => Go for the Gault What a terrific hotel We stayed for three nights and were not disappointed  As mentioned in other reviews the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and young with great dinner and shopping suggestions tailored to what we were interested in  The hotel is clean and modern but still feels comfortable and romantic  Although the hotel was completely booked the weekend we stayed it never seemed crowded or busy a feeling of relaxed but hip elegance was maintained at all time  We stayed in an quotEssentialquot room which is the least expensive but the room was plenty big  No dressers though so prepare to keep your clothes on shelving  The shower was wonderful big with great pressure  The breakfast is amazing plentiful and delicious with hot items cooked to order  The hotel is located in a quiet part of Old Montreal  It is a mostly business district so on the weekends it is very peaceful and private yet the bustle of the more touristy section of Old Montreal which we pretty much avoided is only a few blocks away as is the nearest Metro station  All in all a fabulous time  We would definitely stay there again  
P => One of our best hotels ever We travel a fair amount and generally stay in nice hotels  Based on reviews in Trip Advisor I picked the Hotel Gault for our  day vacation  It is a fantastic place It is a small hotel but everything about it is done big  The modern styling is wonderful  The rooms are large and very comfortable  The breakfast every morning was delicious and the staff was superb  We will stay there any time we travel to Montreal no question If you stay there three other suggestionsAbout three blocks away is a wonderful little bistro called Olive and Gourmando  An excellent spot for lunch For dinner we went to a Greek seafood restaurant called Milos or Millos  It was about  miles away and requires a cab  While an expensive meal every course served was to die for  If you can afford to splurge make this a stop Less wonderful but much less expensive was a place called Holders  It was about two blocks from the hotel and offered a nice selection of food  We both went with Italian and were very happy It all made for an excellent vacation 
P => loved the Gault I stayed at Hotel Gault for one night and did not want to leave definately worth the money  The service was better then excellent Great very spacious rooms and as soon as you think of something you need that you forgot they have it  I highly recommend hotel Gault to anyone traveling for business or pleasure  
P => Hotel Gault WONDERFUL A businesspleasure trip took me to the Hotel Gault in il   What a wonderful place to stay  I travel a great deal especially in eastern Canada  Hotel Gault will be my first choice in Montreal  The staff made me feel like a family member  Andre is magnificent and very helpful  The staff is multi lingual and patient and helpful in such matters  The rooms are very cleverly designed and are comfortable attractive and accomodating  The location in Oldtown gives very good access to business travel and entertainment needs  Ask Andre anything and he will help  I suggest diner at Restaurant Laloux  Stay at Hotel Gault and you will certainly enjoy your business or pleasure visit  It is smaller than most luxury hotels  That adds to the comfort and personal touch  Compared to Sutton Place Toronto or Chateau Lorier in Ottawa the Hotel Gault has the same comfort and accomodtions but they are applied in a more personal way  
P => Hotel Gault My wife Lili and I just returned from a charming Easter Weekend in Francophone Montreal at the excellent Hotel Gault  What everyone says about the breakfast is true Wow  The buffet alone is outstanding with offerings of pate cheeses fruits and croissants  But then you get an additional choice of offerings from the menu which are terrific Lili and I send along personal thanks to outstanding staff Caroline and Dominique who gracefully hosted us  Caroline printed out individual informative reports on local bakeries restaurants museums and shopping  Caroline made terrific dinner reservations and answered all of our endless questions with a smile We found the room ore to be aesthetically interesting AND comfortable which is rare for that modern design look  We had room  which is one of the rooms with a stand alone bath tub    well worth it The hotel is located in what is termed quotold Montrealquot which has the feeling of a Tribeca or Soho which is in the process of being gentrified  The neighborhood is centrally located to points of interest nearby the metro and offers very cool shopping and two great boulangeries One other quick note I am an avid reader and huge fan of books and magazines on architecture photography and interior design  There is an entire library to this effect replete with fireplace We will definitely stay there again  
P => Wed go back even with our toddler  Hotel Gault combines the friendliness and comfort of a BampB w top notch staff and incredibly designed interiors  No snobbery here We needed a quick weekend getaway from Chicago and I felt like I was staying in a friends New York City Loft  Staff member Andre was extra attentive like an old friend telling us the History of the building as well as suggestions for shopping eating etc  Great location a quiet street within walking distance of the Indian cafe Gandhi Andres fav coffee shops cafes boutiques and a great chocolatier shop run by an elderly French couple  Nadine will give you a sampleBeds extremely comfortable nice wine selection of wine while lounging in the library area and delicious breakfast try the benedict  Asked if was OK to bring our son on our next visit No problem and even said they could hire a babysitter for us  Well be back to the Hotel Gault with our son on our next visit  If you want to try something different w lots of style and comfort this definitely should be on your list  This is such a great value 
P => In a heartbeat Especially for our first trip to Montreal the Hotel Gault was a friendly sophisticated home I would go back to again and again  The buildings modern furnishings are balanced beautifully by the original facade the food is delicious and the staff is unparalleled in their helpfulness and charm  Its located in one of the most interesting parts of the city  
P => Truly Fabulous This is a fabulous hotel with an even more fabulous staff  When we arrived after a bit of a struggle finding it due to an error on my part with the address a staff member just coming on duty saw us unloading the taxi from down the block and rushed forward to help us and escort us in  This set the tone for the entire stay with staff always going out of the way to be helpful  They gave us several good restuarant suggestions and were able to get us reservations at places that I couldnt  And  I say a word about the bed The most comfortable bar none that I have ever ever slept in  Great breakfast  Huge exquiste bathroom with heated floor arate tub like a huge gravy boat and large sized shower  If you appreciate great architecture and design you will love the Hotel Gault  I cant wait to go back 
P => The Gaults great reviews are justified My wife and I ided to reserve a room at the Gault for four nights   to    because of the great reviews noted on TripAdvisor  Conclusion they are entirely justified  Excellent quiet location amazingly knowledgeable friendly and helpful staff comfortable room with unique amenities  The full breakfast is delicious and is included in the price of the room  One can easily get spoiled by staying at the Gault  We thought its quotminimalistquot but quotno corners cutquot design made for a great and enjoyable ambiance  Our stay occurred during Montr als quotFashion Week quot One night it turned out that famed Montreal designer Ranata Morales chose the hotels lobby and bar for a party to introduce her new designs  She joined with the Gaults in inviting its few non fashion week guests to attend  We went and had a blast  It became apparent when we checked in that the Gault has a true quotguests firstquot policy and it showed in many many ways while we were there  Wed love to return there  
P => Perfect location perfect stay My wife and I enjoyed a dirty weekend in Montreal recently  Hotel Gault was the perfect venue   the staff is incredibly friendly the hotel is cool and austere without feeling cold or intimidating  The included breakfast is tremendous  And the DVD collection and popcorn delivered to your room ensure that no rainy day is wasted  We cant recommend it highly enough  
P => Tres Chic Getaway We just spent a wonderful weekend at the Hotel Gault which exceeded all expectations  Although the or is stylishly stark the rooms were also very luxurious with excellent bed and linens top of the line stereo and visual equipment fine bath products and extremely spacious  Breakfast was a combination of buffet and al a carte served items could also have a full breakfast via room service for an extra  Due to the slightly quotoff the beaten trackquot location but three blocks from the sights we were able to sleep peacefully with the floor to ceiling windows open woken late morning by the sound of horses hooves as the hotel is on the carriage tour circuit  The juxtaposition of Old World meets cutting edge chic was very charming  Well definitely return  
P => THE BEST Ever Although I travel a great deal for business and pleasure I can truly say that I have never had a better hotel experience than when I stayed at the Hotel Gault It is an amazing property   gorgeous rooms and common areas   with a phenomenal staff So helpful and kind Be sure to ask for restaraunt recommendations and suggestions   the staff will help you find the absolute best of MontrealI wish all hotels were run like the Hotel Gault 
P => Hotel Heaven My husband and I spent a night at the Hotel Gault in   to celebrate our th wedding anniversary  What a fabulous hotel  The design is exquisite our room was huge and had an unbelievable bathroom with heated floors and an exposed brick wall behind the bed  The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great  The location is wonderful in a quiet corner of Old Montreal  As a native Montrealer I usually stay with family when I visit Montreal   too bad as I would love to stay at the Gault more often 
P => The Perfect Mix of Comfort and Style I could not have been happier with the service comfort and style of the Hotel Gault  My wife and I just spent the weekend there and found i our room to be as comfortable as any room we have ever stayed in and we have been in top hotels around the world ii the staff consistently went the extra mile and seemed genuinely pleased to be doing so and iii the design touches were exquisite  Our stay was flawless    we loved the complementary breakfast too  The location is conveniently off the beaten track but a short walk to the heart of the Old City so there were no crowd or noise issues even on weekend nights in e  We will return  
P => The Best Hotel and best People Great Design This is a just wonderful Hotel experience that I ever have  I stay in Hotel Gault for  days and each day I was more suprise that how good the hotel is  The rooms are absolutely beautiful and very good price my boy friend and I just pay  USD a night and we got a supreme service  If you go and stay there you will surprise how nice the stuff members and how polite and helpful  I strongly recommend this hotel to all of my friend  I love staying my I wish there is more hotel like hotel Gault  
P => Friendly Staff Nice hotel in the old part of the city  The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful  Extra touches included a turn down service including bottled water chocolates and weather forecast for the next day  The lobby is an open floor plan with sitting areas breakfastlounge area and reception combined  In the back there is a reading room with a fireplace dozens of designartarchitecture magazines and a DVD library  Our room was spacious with an open floor plan the bathroom and closet spaces were arated by floor to ceiling curtains  The bed was comfortable nice selection of amenities flat screen TVDVD playerCD playerbath robes  The fitness room was small but had excellent equipment  The breakfast was excellent both buffet and menu selections included  The DVDs can be rented from the front desk for  CAN and include popcorn  
P => if your staying in montreal look no further My wife and I stayed at the Gault  the th amp th   If you want a great experience stay here  The staff is incredible  From the moment we arrived til the time we had to sadly check out they were like family  They defined what service is all about  I cannot describe the hotel because it is extremely unique and has won all sorts of design awards  In fact it is the coolest place we have ever stayed  And we have been to some really great places It is super quiet romantic and youll feel as though you have the place all to your self  Heated bathroom floors with a shower roomy enough for five  An extremely comfortable bed and pillows  Large French windows that open to the street below lets you watch the horsedrawn carriages pass by  And just think you could have stayed at the riott instead  We look forward to returning to montreal sooner rahter than later just so we can return to the Gault and our friends  
P => Fantastic I wouldnt consider staying anywhere else  We stayed there for three nights and cant think of a bad thing to say  The staff were very kind and helpful  their recommendations were excellent and they took care of all of our dinner reservations and gave us printed information on everything we asked about  Breakfast was included in the price of our room and was wonderful everyday  
P => Bravo Hotel Gault

P => WOW  
P => wonderful boutique hotel  
P => Great for Montreal

P => Great Place

P => m morable

P => Great location gle themed rooms My boyfriend and I read the reviews of Hotel Kutuma on a few different sites before booking but somehow we managed to miss the fact that it is gle themed When we walked into our room a ior Suite the first thing we saw was a king sized bed ked out in zebra and leopard print bedding and then the fake palm tree and African carvings  But after being cht off guard by the kitsch factor we warmed up to it  Our room was very comfortable and clean  The location was good for walking to many different neighborhoods and the staff was pleasant and accommodating they let us check out  hours late  Im not giving Kutuma  stars however because the microwave and mini stovetop didnt work and the deep luxurious looking bathtub took forever to fill  
P => perfect i dont normally write reviews actually i never have but felt i had to for hotel kutuma  my wife and i spent  days in montreal for a quick vacation and stayed here  when we arrived we were offered a complimentary drink and upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi  very cool  the room was huge bathroom was huge full kitchen with appliances nicer than most peoples homes exposed brick electric fireplace that is kind of cheesy but actually kind of nice king size bed with amazing down comforter and linens  i cant say enough about the concierge although they werent around all the time which isnt necessarily a bad thing they were extremely helpful and friendly when they were  the location is absolutely perfect close to everything restaurants although there seems to be a restaurant every other store front in the entire cityand shopping  we also ate at the restaurant in the hotel the blue nile and it was great Ethiopian food  If you are alright staying at a non chain boutique hotel then i cant recommend this place enough you wont be let down  
P => Service with a smile I cant recommend this hotel enough  Whenever my friends visit a foreign city they always have some story about how they discovered some gem be it a restaurant or a hotel  I was never able to relate but now after visiting Hotel Kutuma I can say that I discovered BOTH Im surprised to have read the last review posted because like any ent traveler I did my homework reading everything that other travelers had posted  It consisted by and large of rave reviews and giving credit where credit is due it has most certainly earned a rave review from me  The hotel is boutique in every sense of the word with its small reception and lack of an elevator but this is where the disappointments end  The rooms are simply delightful  We stayed in a Queen Superior the cheapest room available and with its themed or and dining table for two it was real value for our money I could go on about the little surprises the room had in store like a gourmet coffee maker I LOVE coffee and a fully stocked kitchen with pots pans and cutlery but this would be drawing attention away from Hotel Kutumas real strength the service Never before have I stayed in a hotel where I felt so very welcome  During breakfast the manager sat down with me and my fiance and after chatting with us for a bit pointed out places that we might find of interest  We were thinking of giving the modern art museum a miss but on the managers recommendation we went and I am very glad we did  During dinner at the hotels ethiopian restaurant delicious food the manager came by and offered me and my fiance a complimentary dessert each  The hospitality isnt restricted to just the manager the receptionist was very helpful in recommending other places to go printing out directions and even giving us umbrellas saying that there was a high chance it would rain  It dd In short the rooms were great true value for your money but its the service that will put a smile on your face  
P => Great service and funky rooms     Had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Kutuma recently and felt absolutely spoiled by the management and staff of the hotel and restaurant  Any requests we made were promptly granted and always with a gracious smile  The hotel itself is in a lovely shopping area and jammed full of ethnic restaurants and interesting cafesbars  The or is funky and makes the stay all the more interesting  The bathroom was large and the jetted tub very invitiing  We ate at the Blue Nile restaurant which is directly attached to the hotel and enjoyed the experience of trying a new style of food and eating with our hands  Beware the complimentary desserts   they are delicious Couldnt think of a better location in Montreal to stay and along with the charm of a smaller hotel and the attentiveness of the staff Kutuma is definitely worth a return visit  
P => Wonderful Stay We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Kutuma  The hospitality was wonderful  The manager was so gracious  The hotel is near all festivals  There is no need for a bus or cab unless you dont like walking  It is minutes away from downtown and located on St  Denis street which is a trendy old world charm and a bohemian type of place  The Ethiopian Restaurant in the hotel was wonderful  Try the Combination Platter    My only complaint is the taxes for the hotel and Montreal for that matter  Very expensive and this is coming from someone who lives in Chicago where we have the highest sales tax in the US at almost    Must stay  
P => Kutuma is a little jewel in a beautiful city WOW  Honestly wow My husband and I stayed in Kutuma just last month and we were so very pleased  Its not often that you get to really enjoy what it feels like to be welcomed somewhere  when traveling with true care and concern of your well being and enjoyment Kutuma is a little jewel of a hotel that is located on one of the THE best streets in Montreal  Rue St  Denis  You have everything you could need at your doorstep     such a quaint little park next door and the metro two blocks over plus wonderful shops restaurants and beautiful streets  The best most outstanding highlights of KutumaThe Staff they greet you at the door and carry your bags up to your room they are very personable and will go to very far extremes to help you with your stay  On leaving the hotel the owner personally packed our car with our luggage in the pouring rainThe Hotel Kutuma has a very unique style  Our room was a ior suite     honestly it was the most comfortable stay Ive ever spent in a hotel  The bed was FANTASTIC The bathroom  shower  was very unique in style  We had our own little kitchenette and sitting area as well  The touches that were put in to the room made it a very memorable stay  Also you could hear no one The hotel must be built very soundly     it was like you were in your own little cocoon Adjoining restaurant Kutama has its own restaurant  The Blue Nile  The Blue Nile was our first dining experience in Montreal and we were not disappointed It had a very chic atmosphereambiance with a cool elegant style  The food is Ethiopian and it was delicious The prices were reasonable and the service was impeccable One more personal note that Id like to add     there was an unfortunate event that took place when we stayed in Montreal  Two doors down from Kutuma  second nite of our stay there was a fire that destroyed one and a half buildings  We found this fire around  p m  on a Saturday nite  Kutuma was not available to us  roped off by policefire emergency crew  We were very worried about our well being the hotels and our belongings  The nite wore on without any information on what to do and where to stay Around  p m  one of the staff from the hotel saw us in the street and told us to join them at a neighboring restaurant  The owner of the hotel had sent his staff out in to the streets to try to findlocate people that were staying at Kutuma  The owner paid for us to stay in a  star hotel for the evening  He himself escorted us to the hotel at  a m  to make sure the we were safe and sound in our one night stay WOW  Do I recommend this hotel                 hell yes    
P => Hospitality Will Long Be Remembered Hotel Kutuma    I should not write about this hotel for I am sure there will be a day when I want to return and there will be no vacancy  Yet this best kept secret deserves to be recognized for the quality of excellence pride in ownership and warm hospitality the staff extends to its guests  Attention to detail and making guests a priority are what makes this little hotel rise above all others  The rooms are beautiful unique in design and filled with small touches that make you know you have arrived at a very special place  The rooms are more like beautiful apartments with leather couches brick walls stainless steel kitchenettes and soaking tubs  I stayed in the smallest unit and was totally comfortable and impressed with the space and design  I then had the opportunity to see the larger rooms and was even more amazed by the space and layout  Standards exist in every aspect beginning with the thoughtfulness and warm hospitality of the owner Abby  From offering coffee an umbrella or assistance with luggage Abby extends himself with professionalism and kindness  Standards continue with the highest level of cleanliness safety  and customer care  I had never eaten Ethiopian food and am so happy I had dinner at the adjoining hotel  The vegetarian combination platter was amazing  This continued with the complimentary delicious breakfast of fresh fruit organic eggs potatoes and vegetables and freshly brewed ginger tea  If you are lucky the chef will make his Ethiopian breakfast speciality and I promise you will will be crazing this when you return home  This is a special place at the top of my list of all time favorite hotels which I look forward to returning to again and again  I agree with others I have never stayed at a more wonderful place 
P => very very nice greeted by friendly staff fast check in assisted to room and informed of features of room  room was orated very nice  had plenty of room bed very comfortable small kitchenette with refrigerator microwave and utensils  everything was clean  felt very secure nice stay  hotel is about  minutes from old Montreal  plenty of places to eat within  blocks of hotel  
P => A very unique hotel This hotel is one of the most unique places Ive ever stayed having a fun African theme  The room was exceptionally quiet and clean  My room was located on the rd floor and there were no elevators available which made it tough because of my bad knees  The location of the hotel was near a subway stop which made it easy to sightsee and get around  The listing was supposed to be a Bed and Breakfast but that wasnt true  There was a dining room downstairs opened for dinner only  
P => The best hotel in Montreal by far Hotel Kutuma is absolutely amazing  The location is perfect  Its close to all the great independent shops near Mont Royal and you can easily walk down to St  Catherines or old Montreal  Besides location the hotel itself is beautifully orated and very modern  The rooms are huge and fully equipped with a kitchenette and living room  The bathroom was gorgeous and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on  The room also had a door to a little patio which was covered with plants  The hotel restaurant is also quite nice  It was by far the best Ethiopian Ive ever had  The hotel staff are very nice and accommodating  They even gave us two gourmet cakes after dinner compliments of the hotel  I had a great stay at hotel Kutuma and I will definitely stay there the next time Im in Montreal  
P => Very Nice Very nice place  Super comfy bed huge bathroom with a rainfall shower in the middle of the ceiling which I missed on first glance  Lots of stairs but it was good to work off all the food The only thing I didnt like was the TV   everytime you changed the channel you had to unlock the volume control and you also had to turn on the satelite function if you stayed on on channel for too long    very irritating after awhile  Some mentioned that this is a BampB   it IS NOT a BampB   fyi  I would definetly stay here again 
P => Great value for money This hotel is a perfect find  I used to live in Montreal and didnt want to stay in the quottouristquot area  This hotel is in the best neighbourhood in Montreal close to a subway station restaurants cafes and shopping  The tourist sites are also close by  The rooms themselves are amazing  The bathroom gave me great ideas for future reations All details are taken care of including having candles by the bathtub which would easily fit  in case there is time for a relaxing bubble bath  The rooms have a mini kitchen too complete with glassware and fine china I would have loved to stay longer than one night Another poster mentioned a smell in the front entrance  You can smell the aroma of the Ethiopian restaurant but it isnt unpleasant  And you certainly dont smell anything in the rooms themselves  
P => Big room and great service The rooms at this place are very large with huge bathrooms  There was a full kitchen cable tv and powerful AC  The rooms were ked out in a safari theme with leopard and zebra prints everywhere  My guess is that it carries the theme of the Ethiopian restaurant downstairs  Everything was clean and well kept in and outside the rooms In the heart of the Plateau the location is good in relation to the metro and within easy walking distance of Parc LaFontaine and Mont Royal The service was also commendable  We required a very early taxi to make our flight and there was someone there to help with bags at  am  With two flights of stairs to navigate at that hour the help was much appreciated  
P => Awesome Hotel Staying at this hotel was an awesome experience  Service was exceptional  The hotel itself is very clean authentic or and the staff very accommodating  We needed to use the internet due to unexpected events during our stay in Montreal and staff were understanding and helpful  It was all the little things that made the difference which you would never experience in a large chain hotel I would definitely stay at this hotel again and absolutely recommend this place  It is very conveniently located and within walking distance to all attractions Sab and Nicky 
P => What a place We are aussies on an US and Canada trip  Arrived in the evening and were promptly checked in and pleasantly surprised with the delivery of  complimentary drinks to our room shortly after receiving our luggage  Room was spotless and has everything you would need including real cups wine and beer glasses  burner cooktop microwave toaster coffee perculator hair dryer and iron with board  Free wireless internet which is slow on the top floor but soon sorted it by plugging it in to the ethernet connection conveniently located under the desk  Free bottled water and laundry serviceNice soft bed and great pillows Not the rubberised ones normally found in hotels  Great location  minutes walk to the Metro which will get you anywhere in Montreal  Tried the Ethiopian restaurant downstairs  Great freindly service food delicious and enjoyed complimentary desserts  Treated as part of the family  Lots of other restaurants in the area that are also well patronised  About a  including tip trip by taxi from Central Station Amtrak from New York  Dont procrastinate just book it 
P => A must stay   original luxurious unforgettable experience Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor we booked two nights at Kutuma and can only say this is value for money and an unforgettable way to experience MontrealWe had a spacious room with tiger print sheets sofa and shower curtain and a straw quothatquot on the wardrobe closet  Definitely different from quotnormalquot hotels but very tasteful and consistently orated Our room had a fully equipped kitchenette fridge microwave coffee machine hot plates and kettle a safe a breakfast table set for two and a cozy bathroom with a tub for two and candles as well as toothpaste and toothbrushes in case you forgot On our second night we had dinner in the Ethiopian restaurant on the ground floor and had a pleasant surprise complementary desert The hotel is conveniently located between university and downtown Montreal   both within walking distance   and there are plenty shops and restaurants in the direct neighbourhood When we checked out the mineral water in the fridge turned out to be complementary as well  We left in rather rainy weather and once again we were given an umbrella to keep quoton the housequot These hosts understand what makes a guest feel good even in bad weather 
P => It kinda smells a little The hotel itself is beautiful a little cute boutique hotel but it smelled a little funny  The rooms are immaculate ours came equipped with a little cute kitchen and bathroom  The d cor is modern and at the same time a little ethnic  We stayed one night because our chosen hotel was full that day  Took a red eye out of SF and therefore got to Montreal very early in the morning  We knew we couldnt check in yet the front desk person was nice enough to allow us the use of the restaurant bathroom to change and freshen up a bit before we hit the sights and they took care of our luggage too The Ethiopian restaurant on site was supposed to be the best in town but with all the French food to be had we didnt get to try it  And be thats way the hallways and stairways leading up to the rooms  kind of smell  But the room was gorgeous and definitely didnt smell  
P => Love it The hotel is awesome beautiful cozy and has a very good service  I was a little afraid because I could not found enough reviews to make my ision but I took my risk and it was worth it  Also this hotel is in the middle of downtown so every thing is near to the Hotel  I really have a very pleasant stay in this hotel and I really recommended to anyone  The only constraint is that hotel lacks elevator for the four floors that have  
P => great hotel Fantastic stay at this hotel  The location is great on the busy Rue St Denis though the rooms are surprisingly quiet  The rooms are orated in an african theme and are really well equipped  We were upgraded into a suite with a fabulous bathroom whirlpool bath for two and small kitchen The staff were helpful and very polite  The restaurant downstairs is excellent  The only minor problem we had was regarding breakfast  There is no info on it in the hotel information booklet in your room so we asked at reception what time it was served and were told half eight til half ten  We were then told we could have it delivered to our room if we wished but we lined and said wed just come down assuming it would be served in the restaurant  Following morning we came down and a different member of staff was at reception   we were told breakfast was only served in the rooms and had to be reserved the night before  This really hadnt been communicated to us the previous evening so we were a little put out  However about ten mins later there was a phonecall to our room and they had prepared us a continental breakfast which arrived soon after  Overall the room quality and service more than made up for this misunderstanding but perhaps the management should put info about breakfast in the rooms or make sure that guests are told about it at check in Would definately stay here again and would recommend to a friend  
P => GEM SPOTLESS helpful staff wonderful Ethiopian restaurant downstairs  The bathroom was FAB U LOUS  The bed was super comfortable and its in a fab location  I loved this little jewel of a BampB  Worth every nickle  We booked it last minute just for a little getaway and I would return again without hesitation  Its wonderful 
P => LOVED LOVED this little find CUTE little hotel with lovely or recess lights and wall heaters all around room  Its a deadly cozy full comp little studio with a kitchenette which includes a microwave fridge plates and cutlery kettle and extremly kind and sweet staff  It was my hubbys bday and they ensured chocos and champagne was waiting for him upon arrival  Lydia was ever so helpful with pointers on where to go  I believe there are only a few rooms nine but the touch is so so personal  Full lenght mirrors with makeup zoom mirror in the bathroom u would be amazed how many chains lack full lenghthead to toe mirrors  Ironironing board cable disposable tooth brushes lotion and shampo and a tasty Kutuma brand of coffee which I already miss There is a balcony  View is nothing to write home about but its just a nice to sit out there  I hope my review and pictures helps anyone thinking of booking a room here  The price location and service surpasses most  star hotels  You wont be disappointed  Kutuma is on St Denis Street Rue St Denis a block away from the Sherbrooke metro on the orange line and very very close to all the action including walking distance to Old town and downtown  
P => Top Notch Service Just returned from a great weekend stay at Hotel Kutuma  The hotel is in a great location   close to restaurants shopping and night life  Our room was very comfortable and nicely furnished as was the entire hotel  Even though it is a small establishment  guest rooms we felt completely safe and secure  The highlight of the hotel is definitely the staff   we found them to be always pleasant and willing to offer assistance  They really went the extra mile  The hotel lobby is currently under construction but it in no way impacted our experience  My only regret is that I didnt get to try the hotel restaurant but I will definitely make that a priority next time I visit  
P => LOVED Kutuma despite water and itnernet probs  Was sick of staying in boring big chains for my Montreal business trips and Kutuma got great reviews on Trip Advisor  It lived up to my expectations  I cant believe how nice everything was for the price    Great location on St  Denis    The African theme is fun and well executed    The hotel upgraded my room upon arrival so I ended up with a gorgeous ior suite with balcony for my night  Incredible deal    The bed rivals the Westins dream bed soft music is playing when you arrive in your room   there was a complimentary disposable toothbrush for each night of my stay in addition to the regular creams and shampoos etc  Ive forgotten my toothbrush tons of times when traveling so I thought that was cool   Complimentary big bottle of Kutuma brand bottled water   There was a funky kitchenette not only in my jr  suite but also in my colleagues standard queen room    The staff was really helpful and friendly    The dinner downstairs at the Nil Bleu was really good   Complimentary desert was a nice touch    Theres no elevator but there are only  floors so no big deal for me Im giving this hotel a  despite the  issues below because frankly I really enjoyed myself and the value was amazing   I couldnt get an internet connection the wireless is free which is great but I couldnt get a connection and asked for a cable to plug into the connection directly they gave me one and hooked up my computer for me but that didnt work either   i gave up and didnt bother asking again  There is no shower i dont see why they dont just add a hook up on to the wall since there is a hand held shower and because everyone is taking giant baths in the soaker tubs instead there was no water at all on our first morning and no hot water on the second  Also my plug didnt work I didnt complain though so dont know if it would have been fixed or if I would have been offered a new room From a convenience and an environmental standpoint think of all the extra water massive tubs take to fill vs  a quick shower this sucked  
P => Pefect hotel in an amazing location My partner and I stayed here for  nights  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a large suite which was the nicest room I have ever stayed in  Comfortable bed relaxing tub and tons of space  We had toremind ourselves to leave the room and experience the city  The Metrostation was only   blocks away and St Denis had lots of great restaurants and stores plus we were a stones throw away from St Louis Square and the pedestrian walkway that leads to St Laurent  I cant wait to go back  
P => Loved Hotel Kutuma My boyfriend and I loved this place we stayed for  days in the second week of tember  The room was great the hotel ownersstaff were amazing and its a great location  The room was large and clean and the bathroom was roomy and spotless  The food in the restaurant was outstanding and we received a delicious complimentary dessert after our dinner   I would highly reccommend this place to anyone going to montreal looking to truly experience the city off the tourist track  The only quotsnagquot we had were some loud rude guests in the next room for  nights totally not the hotels fault and it didnt ruin our stay at all  
P => Top of our list This hotel is at the top of our list  We dont like chain hotels or frilly bed and breakfasts and there are few good choices that dont fall into those categories   Kutuma stands on its own We had similar experiences as the other reviewers  The hotel is family owned and they were so nice to us  We had bikes with us and Abbi insisted on taking our bikes into the basement every night after their restaurant closed  When we ate at the restaurant he gave us free desserts  Overall we just felt so comfortable there The room was perfect and so relaxing  Great kitchen and side door that opens for fresh air   We always felt great coming back to it after a full day out  Just ignore the reviewer who gave the hotel only  points everyone loves this placeWe stayed in Old Montreal for the nd part of our visit but I prefer Kutumas location  Old Montreal is too touristy Staying here will make you feel like you are not your average tourist  
P => A Gem The Hotel Kutuma is a real gem of a hotel  The theme of the hotel is Africa and they do a super job with the or  The carpets are in animal print designs as are the bed coverings and artwork  The bathroom was luxurious to say the least with a double whirlpool bath complete with a few scented candles on the side to help you enjoy the experience  Our room had an electric fireplace as well as a kitchen The staff was helpful and offered good tips about where to eat and catch the metro  The hotel is situated in an area rife with restaurants  There is a park close by   I would say this place is perfect except for the fact that it does not have an elevator  The staff was great and carried our bags for us but the long trudge up and down the flights of stairs was not easy for someone with a bit of a mobility issue  
P => Really loved this hotel Really original hotel with African theme  Lovely suite beautifully orated and perfectly clean  The rooms was enormous as was the bathroom  The kitchen is fully equipped and really modern  There was also a great terrace Free fast internet and free laundry service Great staff  
P => Superb boutique hotel The Kutuma is an African themed boutique hotel in the heart of Montreal  It is a true boutique hotel as it only has  rooms on  floors  Dave and I stayed here for  days on our honeymoon  When we called to reserve a few months ahead of time they told us they would upgrade us if there was anything available  When we got there they had upgraded us from a ior suite to the deluxe penthouse suite  Every part of our room was gorgeous from the elephant table in the kitchen to the huge jacuzzi tub  The bed was huge and was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in my life  I have a lot of trouble getting a good full nights sleep and I had no problem during our stay  The or throughout the hotel follows the African theme with tan and brown colors tasteful paintings of wildlife and people and elegant animal print touches throughout  The only negative is that there is no elevator in the hotel so it  be difficult for people with limited mobility 
P => what a great find thanks to fellow trip advisors we booked in at the Kutuma and what a great place it was  Its location is prime as you can walk straight from the hotel a variety of great places  Centre of town is a pleasant walk or metro trip away  The staff were really helpful and could not have done enough or us during our stay  a great boutique location  
P => Couldnt be happier I booked this hotel because the pictures online looked fairly ent for the price and they had an ethiopian restaraunt on the first floor  which we had never tried Me and my new wife spent two nights of our honeymoon here and were extatic with our experience  The room was much more than I had expected  The linens were great the room had a kitchen and the bathroom was really really nice  Also every single light in the place had a dim switch on it  The first person we met when we checked in was Abbi  He insisted on helping us with our bags parked our car for us and offered us something to drink  We modestly said water would be nice but be two minutes later he showed up at our door with mangopapayacoconut drinks  It was amazing Abbi was so friendly and eager to help and it seemed like he was working every morning and night that were there  I would definately recomend this place and have to family and friends  Also give the restaraunt a shot its very unique and really quite good  
P => Loved Kutuma We stayed there from    and we loved it  The Kutuma is a boutique hotel and its orated beautifully  We stayed in a room with a queen bed small kitchette and a bathroom with a big bathtub  There was no shower but the tube had a hand held extension  The front desk usually has one person that runs back and forth from the resturant  Everyone was so nice and tried to help us out in anyway possible  The resturant there was an etiopian style resturant  My husband and I have never had etiopian before but we loved it   it was really good and reasonably priced  Great location  In the middle of shoppingstores on St  Denis  Close to St Catherines and a bit of a walk to Old Montreal but not too bad   be   min  walk  The manager at the hotel was really nice and always making sure we were ok    would definitely go back 
P => Perfect little getaway in a great part of Montreal Even in the dreary cold middle of winter Montreal is a great city to visit and Im already planning a return trip for the summer    with the Kutuma as my likely base of operations  Especially in the off season when it is barely over USDnight for a standard room this hotel was a great value  Its definitely a quotboutiquequot hotel in the truest sense of the word    its a very small operation often with only one person manning the very tiny front desk  Its probably not the ideal place for travelers who put a lot of demands on hotel staff or have an aversion to stairs    theres no elevator But if youre looking for a quiet elegant clean and extremely convenient place to spend your nights in the city you could scarecely do better  The halls and stairway are nicely appointed and the room i got the basic queen was HUGE  In addition to the wonderfully appointed bed especially loved the faux fur throw the main area is set up like a studio apartment complete with a dining area set for two very nice settings by the way a huge wardrobe and a full kitchenette with sink stovetop toaster and mini fridge  The room I had was lacking in all but a couple tiny windows facing the back    perhaps I would have minded in spring but I didnt even notice it during my stay The bathroom sometimes felt a little bit too trendy for its own good functioning but had one huge plus for it    a giant deep two person soaking tub  The faucet and showerhead could have used some higher pressure and really the showerhead and lack of curtainshower area made it inadequate for showering but oh    once i got the tub filled the candles lit it was like a little spa  I originally planned on going out dancing on my second night there but instead wound up going to the best sleep I had in weeks after ordering some excellent ethiopian food from the restaurant downstairs chocolate cake followed by a long soak in the tub while finishing a bottle of wineI never had any problems with noise and the staff was eager to help when needed though I didnt have much in the way of requests other than the meal and figuring out how to use the climate control  The hotel is located about halfway up the Rue St Denis which is a major strip of restaurants stores and boutiques and makes for a nice stroll to any of the adjoining neighborhoods  Metro access is fairly close though travelers with a poor sense of direction might get turned around the first time or two Over all an excellent stay no major problems and for the price I cant imagine anything better 
P => One of the Best Hotels Ever After staying two nights at Hotel Kutuma I rate it as the   hotel in the entire world in my experience  The staff was friendly and extremely accommodating  The rooms are beautifully orated in African or with a dining area and kitchenette  The bathrooms are also nice  The room we stayed in was a regular room and it had a large jacuzzi style tub no jets in the corner  All lights had dimmer switches which added to the atmosphere  The BEST part was the restaurant Le Nil Bleu which is connected to the hotel  They serve some of the best Ethiopian food Ive ever had  It was so good we ate there both nights and both nights we were given a complimentary dessert  You can also get this food brought to your room with room service  I highly recommend it  Its a short walk from the metro Sherbrooke station  
P => Lovely little hotel What a great find We go to Montr al regularly and have stayed at many different hotels but we will definitely be going back to Kutuma  Lovely room quiet comfortable bed huge bathtub and Ethiopian food right downstairs How can you beat that We didnt make much use of the kitchenette this trip but well plan for it next time  The neighborhood is fantastic the M tro is right there and there are all kinds of restaurants and shops around  And they do very reasonable valet parking too  
P => Great Place to stay This was a terrific hotel to stay at  Quite convenient to the Metro amp Latin Quarter  We had room   which looks just like the photo that you see  It has everything you could want in a boutique hotel  We had a small living area with flat panel TV breakfast bar with all utensils that you need refrigerator corkscrews the tiled bathroom with jacuzzi candles etc  My wife loved the entire stay since it rained the entire three days we were there  We also enjoyed the Blue Nile restaurant that is below the hotel  Beautifully done You wont regret staying here 
P => Great Place We were there just this past weekend and I have to say I dont regret staying here  It is at a great location on Rue St  Denis where you can go shopping and Rue Saint Laurent for more shopping or at night go dancing or for drinks  The metro is  blocks away so its easy to get downtown in just mins  The room was very clean and a great African design I would totally stay here again  
P => Greatest Hotel Ever We stayed  nights at the Hotel Katuma in e  over the Formula  Race weekend  The room was great   very spacious including a whirlpool tub kitchen living area and king size bed  The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful  They made us feel very welcome and took care of all of our needs  We tried the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner room service and the food and service was outstanding  Danny at the front desk was very freindly and helpful  He even went out of his way to show us a few other rooms within the hotel which were also excellent  We cant wait to stay here again Great location great room great family owned hotel great price 
P => 
P => great location interesting layout but overcharged  for key i returned the whole complex feels like it is dying  very few customers dont know when the hotel has a front desk person  had to get everything from bartender who didnt know much about what was included in room telephone internet etc   found it to be much too expensive and they put a  room key deposit on my credit card and didnt take it off when I checked out  so now ive been trying to get ahold of someone for two days now to fix the problem and it seems the bartender is the only one who answers the phone and of course cant do anything about it  i would stay there again if it was  a night or less  
P => Americans beware Would not suggest that you stay more than a day or two  My partner and I have been together for  yrs  and when we travel we like to explore the areas  The Complex is in a good location but dont expect to get your room cleaned and you need to ask for extra pillows and clean towels  After a few days though you  want to visit another establishment  You Can expect to be verbally accosted by the staff as Stupid Americans  Farid and Francois were great but only around a short time for the first of our visit  The staff also has a problem with the new owner and morale is low  
P => Great Location Good Price Friendly Service Our room at Hotel Bourbon was clean and well air conditioned a blessing given the humidex of  degrees C F the day we were there  The service is alright the staff is friendly and the hotel itself is in the heart of the clubs pubs and restos of Montreals Gay Village  The front desk is a little disorganized but they make up for it with friendliness relaxed atmosphere and reasonable rates  Hell they even managed to find us a ent room last minute on Formula  weekend You wont get mints on your pillow but rooms have private washrooms AC TV no phone but do apparently have free WiFi we didnt have our laptop with us to check a few quottesterquot packs of shampoos and stuff as well as some clean although mismatched towels Its true the Bourbon isnt a fancy place   but its no dreadful dive either  If youre looking for a casual travel experience ent rooms affordable rates and being close to everything including the metro this is a good hotel to consider  We will be staying there again  
P => Its all relative After spending one night in a DUMP called the Park Hotel in Montreal I went around looking for a place to stay for the rest of the trip  I got a very sweet deal at Le Bourbon   Canadian Dollars for  nights  I payed such a low price because I signed a month long retal lease instead of paying by the night  I was in Montreal for a week French course so I needed a long stay rate That being said the special rate came with a few limitations  There was no breakfast included and room service was only once a week  But I had my laundry done for only CAN per bag  Since I arate whites from coloureds it costed me CAN each time  I did it twice so CAN to have my clothes washed twice in a  week span does not seem unreasonable Ill admit the hotel is not great but my room was spacious TV worked well and bathroom was OK with complimentary soapsshampoos  I could stock the minibar with my own fooddrink and I got ent if erratic public wi fi internet The main problems I faced were the noisy air con and the smallish windows that made the room very hot  But that seems to be a common thing in Montreal  Since everything is built to battle the harsh winters it can be quite warm indoors even if outside is a comfortable C F degrees Location was very good for me  Not only all the nightlife is at your doorstep the subway line was the same I used to get to my school  No need to transfer I would just rush out of the hotel take a double latte at the local Starbucks and be at school in about  minutesTo sum it up  No it is not a great hotel but it worked quite well for my needs and location was great If they could only updated the hallway carpets 
P => Eh  It was clean enough and the staff was pleasant and polite  I shared a  bedroom suite with a friend  The biggest problem I had is that the hotel will not give you a key to your room they say they are trying to protect you from being robbed which has not happened to me in my  years of visiting Montreal regularly  The location is great for gay men it puts you in short walking distance from all of Montreals night life  Price wise the room cost  US dollars for EACH of us for a  night stay  You can do better for less but if location is important this hotel has that covered Lastly parking is a bit inconvenient it a few blocks away and you have to pay  a night for it  
P => Hotel Le Bourbon   Not bad but not fantastic I went to Montreal for gay pride yust  and stayed at Hotel Le Bourbon  I read the past reviews and was a bit scared  I got there and the hotel clerks were very very nice  I stayed in a  bedroom suite room   It was cute a arate bedroom and the living room was on an upper level which faced the back of the hotel  The air conditioning didn t work well at all the room kind of smelled like dirty socks the TV got no reception and the phone receiver stuck to the phone when I tried to use it  I complained and was moved quickly to room next door room  another one bedroom suite  This had the living room and bedroom area all on the upper level with only the bathroom on the lower level  It was ok I liked it because the air unit was close to the bed  Although it was a bit loud it worked and at this point that s all that mattered  My friend stayed in Suite   A really nice  bedroom suite that had a kick     air conditioning unit and hardwood floors which faced the bustling street activities  Also a lot of the rooms had a large gap opening at the bottom of the front doors and adjoining doors inside the suites to the other suites from your room  You know like the door was cut about an inch too short at the bottom  This allowed you to hear everything in the hallways and sometimes all the way to the front desk   and also allowed others to hear all your business from your room too  Am I just picking this hotel apart or what No I am just stating the facts as I found them for others who need to know so they can make up their own mind to stay here or not The bath house which most of the ads for this hotel said was still there is gone and they have made more rooms in that space  There is an inside bar right off the lobby which I never saw more then  people in and they were mostly playing the machines  There is a bar on the roof top but I walked up there once and it was dead also so I never went back  There is a  cafe   Club Sandwich which was right off the front door of this hotel which I ate at and was not really too impressed it was ok but not really busy either  Yes the hallway carpets are still gross as so stated in many previous posts but I am not staying in the hallway so who really cares  The maid will not intrude on you to clean your room and will only come in if you have the clean room sign out so if you don t hang it out dont expect them to knock or visit at all they will simply leave you alone until you request it I was kind of shocked at how dead this place was for gay pride  I expected it to be packed with people but I barely saw about  guests in my five day stay so apparently there are other hot spots to stay at  This is in the center of a great area with eateries and bars everywhere  The very popular SKY bar with  levels and a great rooftop area is about  feet from the hotel I do not think I would stay here again just because the price for my suite was about   American and I really didn t think my room was worth it although the  bedroom suite rocked and was well worth the price if you have a travel buddy  I think Montreal probably has a lot better places to stay that are a bit more fun and lively  This place seems to have had its day and that day seems to have past which is a shame  Gay Pride  and the hotel was so dead and quite   yea   this hotel has seen its day  There are some great restaurants on St Catherine that had some great food  Also some of the strippers at the bars were extremely hot    for a private dance  The bars were fun the Casino was fun and the experience of Montreal was fun but the hotel   not so much Well that s my experience anywayCheersChip 
P => a hotel in the midst of everything I did a tour of this hotel this past weekend     I found the rooms to be well eqquipped with fridges microwaves and very clean the suites had jacuzzi tubs in the master bedroom and leather sofas and settees in the living rooms  The prices were very reasonable especially when you compare them to the major chains I have only  concerns  The hallway carpet has seen better days  It is not torn but is worn and dirty  However they are in the midst of construction and improvements  The rooms have all been redone recently  This accounts for the worn hallway carpet  As I was told there is no use replacing it while all this construction is being done The only other concern I have is that some of the rooms windows overlook some of the outdoor terraces  This is not a problem in winter when there is no one outside but in summer there might be a problem with noise  The bars close at  am so if you have people outside on the terrace drinking until  you  not be able to sleeep The hotel is located in a complex that includes a large restaurant with many outdoor terraces  a disco several bars a billiard and internet room  The staff is The complex is located in the heart of the gay village of Montreal so it is close to all bars boutiques video stores strip clubs and bathhouses  Also for touring the city it is close to the subway station and from there one can travel across the whole city  The subway is fast quiet safe and affordable  
P => on its last legs I have stayed at the Bourbon frequently over the past  years  Over the past  years or so management has let it deteriorate to the point where I will never stay there again  It is always in a state of construction never busy the sauna has been eliminated and the structure is a wreck  I stayed there this past weekend ust  for one night  The room was not made up at check in  The toilet was broken and not fixed by the time I moved in despite calling the defect to the attention of the staff  There was exposed wiring where a ceiling fixture used to be  The bathroom door wouldnt lock and the ceiling was cracked all the way accross  Not to mention that the room smelled badly  The Bourbons prices are above comparable gay lodging in the immediate vicinity  Their restaurants are always empty and it is apparent that the owners are committed to letting the facility fall apart  Every room I have had over the past  years there has been horrible but I always hoped there would be a turnaround  There hasnt been so they well never get another dollar of my money  Stay ANYWHERE else but here 
P => Is this a bath house I am from Montreal but I moved Many years ago  I went to Montreal in e and stayed at Hotel Le Bourbon What a dive DIRTY dirty and dirty this hotel is simply dirty and I think that the owner doesnt care because this place is in the heart of the village but next time I wil live out of the village and sleep in a clean place  It is a good place if you want a cheep thrill because the hotel is like a bath house where every body is hitting on every body people are going from room to room not a place for a monogamous couple  Big rooms but cleaning staff under paid and not trained one told me that he was paid cash and collect welfare so you see what type of owner runs this place Never again 
P => Great We stayed with a group of friends and really enjoyed it  The location was great with everything there  it made it worthwile  The Holiday weekend was great with a view of fireworks over the bridge from the rooftop  
P => Great Location   Needs Paint Carpeting Cleaning A group of us went up for the y th weekend  We ided to book at the Bourbon based on their website and great location  We did read the trip advisor ratings of this propery well after we booked our trip and were a bit concerned over the cleanliness but ided as a group that we would quotcheck it outquot for ourselves  I am always amazed on how bad a place can be in the heart of a gay community where we as a segment of the population always likes and demands better  Here is our critique  We had a large suite and a ior suite  Both suites were spacious with lots of room  The larger suites AC was broken all weekend  The cooler weather made it bearable  Both suites could use new carpeting as the stains are becoming more numerous then the actual color of the rug  Linens and curtains should be replaced as they have seen better days  New paint would make both suites better and the hotel a much better place to stay  The cleaning staff should be re trained or even trained and probably paid better as they can do a much better job at cleaning  The hallway carpeting should be ripped up and replaced either with new carpeting or tile  Its just sooo dirty that the red color is now more a black carpet that is tinted red  We have certainly stayed at worst places in different cities but at a much cheaper price  At the Bourbon Montreal you are paying a premium for the location and not for the condition of the hotel  If cleanliness is a concern the Bourbon Montreal is not for you A few words of advice for the owners  I would remove the word luxury from all of our brochures and website  I would remove the pictures of the rooms and really just show more of a diagram of the rooms  People will get the wrong impression from your pictures  You should also look into redoing the rooms  Gay people will pay an even bigger premium knowing that they are not only get a GREAT location but really ent room as well  
P => Great Location ent Accommodations I stayed at the Hotel Bourbon for  nights in il   The Bourbon is in a great location for anyone but particularly for gay travelers because its right in the middle of the citys largest strip of gay bars cafes etc  In addition its only about a mile or a short subway ride  stations within a few blocks of the hotel from the center of downtown and the tons of shopping there  Plus its also a   minute walk from the Old Montreal touristrestaurant area on the river As for the hotel itself my room was clean but not spotless  But the things that didnt pass my white glove test were not alarming  One thing I didnt like was that the only window in the room was actually a glass door that led to a k shared with several other rooms  This meant that I could only air the room out when I was in the room and awake  Be aware that the hotel is part of a large complex that includes several restaurants  When I went to bed Saturday at  AM music from the pub downstairs was still pretty loud  It was drowned out when I turned on the air but who knows if that always works  One nice feature is that my room and another that I saw had a mini fridge  Im sure the rates go up during the peak summer tourist season but my pre high season rate of night Canadian not incl  tax was a pretty good value considering the location  By the way another thing that wasnt well publicized while I was there is that most or all of your hotel tax will be refunded to you upon your depature at the airporttrain station or by mail if you submit a form with your hotel receipt  So save that receipt 
P => Simple accomodations friendly discreet staff Ive been to Montreal four times in the past two years the last time was in ember of   Ive always stayed at Hotel Bourbon Complex  Its centrally located in the heart of the gay area of Ste  Catherine Street  The rooms are clean and simple  At least one of the restaurants in the complex is open  hours  Ive never been there in the summer but Im sure the view from the rooftop bar overlooking Ste  Catherine must be very nice  Ive also felt very comfortable bringing acquaintances back to my room  The only thing I think they should make people aware of is that some of the single rooms dont have completely private bathrooms  Otherwise I find the accomodations satisfactory  
P => Cute Place in the center of it all I stayed there for  nights in a quotsinglequot and you cant beat it for the price the room was a nice size very clean and had a balcony  and its right dead center of everything  The concierge people were very sweet as well as the friendly bartender Simon  I would definately stay there again 
P => what a difference Stayed at the Bourbon   and It was ok  Stayed at the Bourbon    and what a difference  The place was spotless many items looked to have been upgraded since last yearcould not find any fault with the Bourbon  Staff was very friendly  I myself think that people dont realize that when you have the amount of people coming into a place as the Bourbon does that you can continually sweep the carpets so they look new all the time  You could clean a place  hours a day and someone would find fault with it  I myself will be staying at the Bourbon again and telling all my friends to stay thereoh by the way my buddy found no fault with the place either  But then I dont have to be catered to as some do  
P => 
P => Le Breton   Not what it used to be Many guides still refer you to what was a great small hotel in the heart of Montreal  But with the neighbourhood going downhill note that the hotel also has had a change of management a few years ago so check the timeline for any guide or review you see That stretch of St Hubert Street was never the splendid suburbs but the National Library taking a whole long block of closed at night real estate a large park squatted with drug dealers that spread to side streets and a syringe exchange program right across the hotel it sure didnt get better  Advantages are proximity to downtown core the Village the bust station and the main subway exchange station  Disadvantage among a few is that whereas old management was selective in clients and built a long term international following of repeat customers the new one seems mostly interested in short term cash Depending on your room neighbours your milage  vary  But the is better at similar prices So some folks list their bad experiences here  Any hotel could list a few  Make your own mind I made mine After being a regular for over a ade I visited but did not stay after the new owners took over  
P => Be afraid I am  Im so disturbed that I felt compelled to write this review almost immediately after I arrived  First of all the bathroom reeks of smoke although this proposes to be a quotnon smoking roomquot  I took the cover which betrays a nauseating canvas of yellow and brown stains off of the bed immediately  Im pretty sure I walked through a sizable area of something sticky on the floor adjacent the bed  I wonder if the hookers outside know what it is  Theres no toilet paper  Starbucks napkins are rough  The shutters are patchworked together and look like a broken grill  I can see the kies outside through the missing slats  We went to the corner deli down the street and a crackhead followed my boyfriend back to the car demanding money  I was unhinged by this  We returned without dinner  I hope tomorrow comes soon  Oh and it sounds like somebody is dragging a body around in the room above us   and everything in here is this vomitous buttermilk color  
P => If you want to get robbed stay here The guy that owns the hotel sleeps in the lobby giving the illusion that the hotel is quotVERY VERY SECUREquot  He spends his time making sure the crackheads and prostitutes outside arent near the doors of his hotel while customers are around but when customers leave he robs them of all their valubles and denies it  He pretends to care about the safety of your things i e quotyou didnt leave any of your money in the car i hope this is a rough neighborhood quot while making sure that he can sneak into your room go through your bags and rob you blind while you are out trying to enjoy Montreal  Apparently this hotel is quotso securequot that quotno one could get in to take your belongings quot But when questioned about his employees capability to steal he pretends not to understand english and says there is only one set of keys for each room  The room looked nice upon arrival but once the sun goes down and the locals come out there is no possible way of getting any sleep between loud kies and strange noises and apparent fights inside the hotel Overall this hotel has quotsecuredquot the top honors for worst hotel ever stayed in  As for the location and local inhabitants youre not likely to find more crack dealers and kies on any other street in Montreal  
P => Pretty Impressive for Downtown Montreal My boyfriend and I stayed there on a Saturday night  The room was small but the furniture was really nice  and modern  The bed was big and comfy  The owner did not speak english well  but enough to get by  The hotel was  bocks from the St  Catherines street night life  but beware that the night life and all it brings does end up in front of the hotel  no prolems  just a bit noisy  We had the front room on the main level  not good if you dont like to be disturbed  The bathroom is really small  and parking is a pain   for the night at the lot  but if you can grab a spot on the street its free  I would definitly go back  
P => Very Enjoyable Expereince My boyfriend and I stayed and Le Breton for the weekend while in Montreal and found the stay to be very delightful  The hotel had a warm French ambience and the owner was a very sweet man  The room and bathroom was very clean and the bed was very comfortable  The coffee and crossaint for breakfast put the icing on the cake  I will defenitly come back to this hotel my next visit to Montreal  
P => 
P => Amazing room great bathroom  Good location As you enter this amazing hotel you will be impressed by the beautiful chandeliers  Reception staff a bit arrogant but courteous enough  My room was just stunning very roomy and the bed amazing so comfortable   Ipod system great sound  internet is free but i keep getting messages that server was down  A great espresso machine and it made the best espresso ever    yummy The bathroom just incredible very spacious and with a beautiful large bath including delicious bath salts for the body and great shampoo and conditioner Negatives in the morning I was waking up by trucks not sure what they were be rubbish collectors or street cleaning cars   Breakfast was okay but we thought it was expensive and quality it was not that great  
P => Pretty much delivers Booked a package with  night two  hour massages breakfast valet and late checkout available on their website  Considering what you get Id consider a good deal  Location is very good  Turn right when leaving the hotel and all there is the Bell Center couple of restos and the convenience storegas station  Go further and you are leaving the downtown core  Not a bad or sketchy location if you dont like noise get out of downtown  Turn left and you are in the center of the city a perfect location for someone wanting to stay downtown and not in Old Montreal which is different  Check in fairly early at pm  Asked about smoking policy and is non smoking  She then offered a room with a balcony which is an upgrade free of charge  Perfect Room was a suite great bathroom kitchenette etc    Furniture all modern and stylich  Very nice  Spa was good not super luxury but nice for a th floor urban spa  Pool is a nice tough and hot tub amazing Im from Montreal and never saw such a nice view from an outdoor hot tub  Great urban getaway  Ordered rooms service was a touch slow but everything good and delivered with class  Valet was helpful and concierge seemed top notch overheard people making club reservations etc   Overall the hotel is nice new friendly and hip  I was very satisfied and really enjoyed our downtown vacation  Pretty much ideal especially if you use that hot tub 
P => Very Cool and Great Customer Service Very hip and stylish room with great space and the bathroom was very big and clean  The attention to detail was wonderful and tin at the front desk could not have been sweeter  We will definitely be back 
P => Excellent all suite boutique hotel We like boutique hotels and Montreal offers a lot of good choices but we tried Le Crystal because of the kitchenette with the expresso machine which we wanted for early morning risings  The standard deluxe suite was very comfortable and offers more room than many boutique hotels  The bathroom was very roomy  We found our suite clean and quiet  Lots of extras like robes slippers umbrella bathroom amenities flat screen tv ipod playing alarm clock  Wireless internet access is complementary The downtown location was great for our interests and needs although a first time visitor  prefer a Vieux Montreal location We also tried La Coupole both the restaurant for lunch and the bar after dinner  Lunch was very good and the bar was comfortable with good service Used the gym and enjoyed the view from the th floor  The outdoor hot tub looked like it would be great Service throughout was very good  We had no complaints at all and the price at  per night was good value  
P => One of The Best by a Mile We were visiting for a hockey game at the Bell Centre  The location was perfect  The Service was excellent  Extra Umbrellas for the rain  Robes and Slippers in the Room  Every kind of Toiletry product you could imagine  Fluffy pillows and a throw on the sofa  The best hotel sofa that I have sat on  They are usually so uncomfortable  The Espresso Machine was a really nice touch as well  Our really sweet maid Karen got us cream from the kitchen on her lunch break for the coffee I loved the erate bedroom which stayed nice and dark for sleeping in  The hotel is in walking distance to everything  I dont understand the person that complained about a store  There are several within  steps of the hotel  The closest is the esso station but Shoppers Drug t and several other conenience stores are very close  If you like Italina I wasnt sure about the mixed reviews of Il Campari Centro across the street so we walked over to Bishop and ate at Davincis  It was awesome  Ask for a higher floor to avoid the hockey crowd or club crawler noise  
P => amazing     The best hotel that ive stayed in my life The bedroom is extremely nice and the expresso machine made me so happy in the morning time    the spa is in the top of the building and the pool is with salted water   
P => Beautiful Hotel But Bad Location  Very Noisy in Morning Shady Character at Night Hotel  is Very Nice Location is in a Very Bad Part of Town  Lots of Young Crowds out of the Bars at Night  Very Noisy in Early Morning  Garbage Truck  And Pumbling Noise  Every half hour and so forth and Front desk wink a themselves  and tell you is cant be possible they made up little by offering me Lousy breakfast top it all up  i was acosted at night by shady characters hanging in the lobby  Room Need some Sprucing up  in Bathroom  found Lots of hairs in Shower  and fridge didnt work Most of the time Paid   on HotwireDont Pay More for Room  
P => Great modern rooms great pool and great location My husband and I stayed here because the price based on what you get at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth was hard to beat AND because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and the pics on the hotels site  We were glad we did The hotel is only a couple of years old and the rooms and or were very modern  More importantly the bed was great We also loved the location and the pool  I would have given it a  except that I am a bit of a neat freak and did not feel the bathroom was quite clean enough  Also the coffee in our room was not replenished without us asking on our third day there and we had to ask for a second pair of slippers only one was provided  Other than that a beautiful place to stay especially if you want a nice room for a very good price we had a deluxe room which was a suite and the price was only  per night  Hard to beat 
P => Great Hotel First time in Montreal and I did select this hotel based the positive reviews found in this web site  And I was absolutely happy for that  The service is really attentive  the location is perfect and within walking distance of the centre of the city  I had a deluxe suite  perfect and very comfortable  Nice additional tip the Nespresso Coffee machine for a nice espresso coffee  Excellent breakfast for quality of food and fantastic lunch at the Brasserie Restaurant  So I was really satisfied with my choice and next time I will be staying again at the Hotel Le Cyrstal  
P => Chic Hotel Ideal Location for First Time Montreal Visitors This hotel was fantastic  My husband and I normally stay at chain hotels because they are quotsaferquot as they have a set standard and are easier to predict but ided to take a chance with this  star independent hotel  What a wonderful ision we made for our honeymoon The staff are so friendly and helpful helped us with subway and map questions and the hotel is simply beautiful  It is chic and modern with a luxurious feel to it  Right up the street one block is St  Catherines which has lots of places to eat and shop  We also cht a hockey game at Bell Centre which we could see from our hotel room  It literally took a few minutes to walk to the game We loved this hotel and will be going back the next time we return to Montreal  
P => Wonderful hotel The hotel was wonderful the suite was very well appointed with a nice living room and a GREAT bathroom  Location is very good the pool was a nice plus with the kids  As the weather was good we also enjoyed the outdoors patio  The staff was helpful  
P => disappointed Beautiful hotel from the outside and the lobby was superb  Here were my problemstwo computers for guests use no time assigned so hard to get on to then they were continuously out of order  Had to pay in advance for the room because the front desk clerk was new and made a mistake  Room was tiny    photos were misleading quot partner and his feet were off the end of the bed  Finally had a drink of cranberry from the mini bar late at night and threw up Turned out some of the mini bar was well out of date  On a positive note the food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff spoke very good english  
P => Very cool suites nice location and beautiful gym Based largely on Trip Advisor reviews my husband and I stayed here  nights while vacationing in Montreal  Le Crystal is a new sleek suite hotel in a very convenient location unless you want to be in Vieux Montreal  We loved the privacy of the bedroom within the suite the large well appointed bathroom and the lovely pool and exercise room  The location was good as well   near a Metro stop shopping Mont Royal and restaurants  
P => Just Ok Hotel  Not a  Stars Hotel and Service  Oh Well where do iSTt When i arrived at the hotel  Front Desk People were friendly and check in  was Fast  the lobby is beautiful  I was excited to be Here   Went up to the room Expecting a great Room for  or so price oh Well i was just ordinary  in style  modern room  with a cramped feeling to it  Nice bed but in Somewhat Small Room and Tiny Living Room  with cheap Furniture  the Kind you find in Target and a small kitchenette galley bathroom is Nice and Clean  ok Then i accept it like that was too excited to complain in front of friends  it is not better than suite hotels you found on major highways in usa  like the amerisuites  hotel that i previously stayed in california this summer  and paid   us  per night  with more amenities  like a gift shop  great breakfast and nice lobby entertainment like a late open bar  none here in this hotel  we found a great breakfast place ard corner at cora crowded bars on crescent street next block  we had a blast there the hotel is part appartment  and i heard from cleaning lady that it is Time Sharing  hotel  Funny but i was not surpsed about it This Hotel even tow  it is beautiful at first  doesnt have a Soul  it really look like any Luxury appartment Building  in any Big Cities  Bt Seriously When i want to go on Vacation  i want to feel like i am on Vacation  Not Renting  Out a Sublet in a Boring Appartment Building with No Extras  Like a Gift Shop  Late Dinner Restaurant  Bar with Nice Music  None you Findng here at Le Crystal  Oh Yes there is A Beautiful Crystal Chandellier  But Sadly it is Not Able to compensate  for the Lack of Amenites  
P => Sweet Suites We visit Montreal at least once a year dividing our stays between the city center and Old Montreal  We have tried five other hotels and chose this one based on reviews at this site and the desire to try yet another Montreal hotel  Overall we were pleased with our choice Most of the rooms at this boutique hotel are suites  Our choice was a deluxe suite which has a layout with the bedroom located in the middle of the suite without direct access to a window  There is a glass see though panel that opens to the living area  The living roomdining area had two floor to ceiling windows that more then make up for the lack of an outside window in the bedroom  There was also a kitchenette area and for once more then enough storage space in the room and bathroom  The look of the suite is contemporary with a slight minimalist feel to it  The bathroom was very spacious and nice but a little on the boring side for such an ample area The only other area of the hotel that we used was the swimming pool which was very nice  It is located on the fourteenth floor with walls of glass on two sides  There is also an outside terrace with lounge chairs and a hot tub  Small changing rooms are nearby with showers as is a sauna  The gym area was nice with big windows but it did not have enough equipment for a complete workout  The spa is also located on this level but we did not investigate  We tried to have a drink in the hotel at pm on Saturday night and learned that this was not possible  This was very surprising and disappointing that a nice hotel this size could not provide this basic service We also could not help but notice that the service at this hotel was not very friendly  We normally do not complain about service or even have service problems but almost every employee we encountered was just barely friendly  Overall we enjoyed our stay at this property especially the spacious room and nice pool  If those features are important to you then this hotel is a good choice for you  It is also right across the street from the Bell Centre if you happen to be attending an event there  
P => Sweet Honeymoon Hotel Traveled to Montreal for my honeymoon  I booked the Hotel Le Crystal based on the many positive reviews I read and I wasnt disappointed  The hotel is in a nice location downtown within an easy walk of plenty of restaurants bars and shopping including the Underground City  We had one of the smaller suites but it was still plenty big enough for honeymooning  The or was modern and clean  The bedroom was arated from a living room by a glass wall  Both rooms had flat screen tvs and the living room had a nice view of the city  The bathroom had a huge shower with a rainshower head and a regular shower head  The maid service was excellent  When we initially had trouble with the air conditioner they immediately sent a service man to fix the problem  When we asked for additional towels they were delivered quickly  The front desk people were friendly and helpful and made restaurant reservations at my request  All in all the hotel was great  
P => Fantastic stay   didnt want to leave We booked with      com and took a chance on a new hotel We were there at  and they didnt have a room ready right away so we were a little worried about how things would go  However the delay was brief and we were given access to a fantastic suite with an enormous  sf patio overlooking the restaurant patio  The rooms were quiet the bathrooms incredibly spatious and the rest of the room well appointed and well laid out The concierge staff were fantastic  Good advice on restaurants and one of them even went as far as to arrange a pre diiner cocktail on the house for us on our first booking   very nice touch The location is great staff are fantastic and youll love the rooms  Dont overlook this one 
P => Great room and service excellent pool Traveling with my sister and her young kids we were upgraded to a superior sweet because our room wasnt quite ready  It wasnt huge but the bathroom was with its glass shower soaking tub generous double vanity and Molton Brown toiletries  The or was modern but comfortable and interesting  Little touches like an iPod dock a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and faux fur throws made us very cozy in the room  The saltwater pool is gorgeous with a glass wall revealing a great view of Montreal and the outdoor hot tub k is heavenly  The pool always seemed to have visitors and not surprisingly  The lobby is cool and funky and we found the staff really helpful with dinner reservations parking etc  and there was always a basket of apples on the front desk which definitely pleased the kids  The hotel property is in easy walking distance of a couple of different Metro lines and there is a great breakfast place nearby called Eggspectation just a couple of blocks north on Rue de la Montagne  They served a huge cafe au lait and some fabulous brioche francaise with bananas and cinnamon Overall we felt that the hotel was lovely comfortable and modern  A great value too in a really good location and the pool is a huge bonus  
P => Montreals Crown Jewel This is the most magnificent property the BEST location and the service is extraordinaire Walk to St  Catherine and Crescent St the Bell Center or arrange for the Bellman to take you to quotOld Montreal quot It just doesnt get any more convenient The nightlife no taxi needed  The fabulous restaurants no taxi needed  Sporting events across the street  Concerts Im sure this is were the quotstarsquot stay The accommodations are superb Internet access is FREE  A beautiful spa excellent fitness equipment with a view and salt water pool and hot tub  The outdoor k has a view of Mont Royal and the setting sun BYOB You cant go wrong at the Crystal I wish theyd franchise so I could stay at them worldwide  
P => highly recommended I booked this hotel through hotwire the website where the name of the hotel is revealed after full payment  I was pleased to learn that I had booked the Crystal as I had already read the positive reviews  The Crystal is located in downtown Montreal just opposite of the Bell Centre  The blocks surrounding the hotel are dull but it is short walk to shopping streets and about  min to the old town My room was well appointed and equipped  It consisted of a kitchenette a work and living room area and a arate bed room  The colours are soft and natural be a tad boring  Both bedroom and living room have large flat screens  I was very content with the ample storage space and the ipod dock on the desk  Internet is free of charge and worked fine The double bed was extremely comfortable but very narrow  I would recommend duos to book a room with twin beds The health club has modern equipment and a small swimming pool and a jaccuzzi with a view I am now having a delicious lunch in the restaurant while writing this review  My only major complaint would be the breakfast buffet which is very limited  I had breakfast in cafes in the area instead I would say this is a top choice for business travellers  Tourists might be better off choosing a hotel in the old town  
P => Best choice in Montreal We stayed at Le Crystal for a long weekend in one of the two room suites   The room was excellent and spotless included two flat screens a comfortable living area and bedroom  Microwave dishware espresso maker were all in the room and the bathroom was huge with double sinks stand up shower and arate tub  Staff was very friendly and helped us find a great sushi spot called Zen Ya which we highly recommend  Its a little hard to find but worth it once you get inside  Angelos Italian was also very good  We parked in the valet for day although there is outdoor parking across the street at day if you dont mind the open lot  The gym and roof top were great as well  We thought the hotel is in the best location out of most of the other top choices just around the corner from Crescent  We will definately stay here again when back in Montreal  
P => Good value but not the best  star hotel Bit surprised by some of the rapturous reviews on the site yes the hotel is good value for money compared to other cities around the world but it is in no way comparable to some of the top  star establishments  The foyer area is rather sterile and uninviting restaurant food is quite good but breakfast is appalling No freshly squeezed juice or even Tropicana for that matter meagre selection of pastries and the worst coffee we had in Montreal  For a city with such great restaurants it was shocking and room service was no better  However the coffee in the Millesme cafe was not too bad so its worth paying the extra and getting your morning coffee there  For a hotel thats only a year old you can already see signs of wear and tear our carpet in the executice suite was rather badly stained and the room was filled with the smell of smoke which to be fair the staff did try to rectify The kitchen area was nice and Im sure that if you bring a young family it is very convenient as there was a arate shower roomtoilet and a sofa bed in the livign room area  The room was spacious as we had the most expensive room bar the penthouse suite which was not available but it wasnt exactly kitted out luxuriously and its obvious they used cheap materials to build everything  However the spa is nice gym just ok pool area hit and miss  Breakfast sorely needs improving and staff could be a little more knowledgeable Also turn down needs to be until later in the day who wants their curtains all closed at pmThere are a LOT of curtainsSTaff were perfectly nice and the bell boysvalet service was good  ALso free internet was very useful Not sure if I would stay here again but possibly if we came with a small family The area is near shops and nice department stores but Montreal has more charming neighbourhoods  
P => Ideal Loved loved loved this hotel The location is perfect    a block from shopping on St  Catherines and  to  blocks from the Peel metro station  For the tech savvyintrigued your room key powers the room  Loved the wetbar w microwave and mini fridge  The wireless internet was unavailable most of my stay however the computers downstairs did the job  The staff was very accommodating however be sure to press the quotDo not Disturbquot button before going to bed   housekeeping rang my doorbell  times before am the first morning The frontdesk staff was very helpful  I had trouble unlocking the safe and they sent a technician up in  min who resolved the issue  I had an early flight out and the valetsbellboys ensured a cab was waiting to take me to the airport Le Crystal is a wonderful hotel and I will definitely stay there again 
P => Great Hotel     BEST SERVICE    Everything in walking distance We came with a large group and got  rooms for  nights  I would have to say the service was incredible  Not one of the rooms complained about ANYTHING     trust me with my group that would have found something  This  not be a family style hotel but this is the spot for those special weekends when you need to get away  All suites awesome restaurant with a patio amp DJ  Close to everything shops bars night clubs restaurants anything you need  Montreal is great but you better spend the cash and stay at the LeCrystal its worth it  I give props to the house keeping crew they had a lot of work and they maintained that place like no other Thank You Francais Frank and the rest of the staff  Hope you will let our roudy bunch come back  
P => Amazing Accommodations We stayed at Le Crystal for  nights and we had an amazing time in Montreal and at this hotel  The staff and service were top notch  The accommodations were immaculate and stylish without being snooty  There was nothing to complain about  The saltwater pool and rooftop jacuzzi were great pluses much welcomed after walking the streets of Montreal   I already miss the city and the hotel   WE WILL BE BACK 
P => Great location Service Rooms    Lets get the bad out of the way   Breakfast  be the worst in Montreal  Below ays Inn quality   We could not even eat it and this is the third time we tried it  Ended up walking to Chez Cora nearby which is about the best breakfast in town  This is my third stay and my room was not ready by check in time  out of  times  Recommend getting there  minutes after check in or call ahead on your way in to see if room is ready  WOW is that lame   Otherwise the hotel is very nice  Service is that typical Quebecois trying to be nice but you can tell they are really trying hard  Rooms are clean and spacious we had an executive suite which was nice  Location could not be better  The new bar in the hotel is very nice especially the outdoor part in summer Expect to pay at least    more in summer than winter  Do not order room service if you can help it  It was very lame  With so many restaurants nearby you should really get out and eat as much as possible I will stay here again but I would not recommend bringing any kids under age   It is really meant for adults unlike Loews Vogue which caters to kids and upscale guests as well  
P => Even better than expected We spent five days at Le Crystal in y and after reviewing the web site were expecting a comfortable suite with amenities  But we did not expect the sheer pleasure of the quality of this hotel  A beautiful spacious room with arate king bedroom enormous bath with soaking tub and arate shower twin sinks storage well beyond what we have ever seen in a hotel Nepresso machine which delighted us every morning the wonderful pool and spa  A joy to return to each evening after exploring the delights of Montreal  But what made this hotel even better was the quality of the staff cheerful pleasant and helpful without being cloying  Everyone we met the desk staff valets the waitress at breakfast the pool staff and especially our concierge  The staff should be commended  On another note we finished our visit with dinner at Europee truly an experience with an endless series of desserts  But we also delighted in a little restaurant around the corner on Crescent Bistro le The au Logis with a wonderful choice of teas and fresh beautifully prepared Korean specialities well adapted to Western tastes  Charming service an elegant chef and her son intriguing art work  A delight 
P => Shiny new property come HIGHLY recommended Firstly I can easily recommend this property  It is an all suite property for a price that would get you a nice room at similar hotels in the city  The suite we stayed in reminded me of a nice executive corporate apartment which I believe the developer was selling within the higher floors of this building Several days prior to arrival I called to request dinner reservations including a late reservation for Au Pied de Cochon  They pulled through which I really appreciated An unfortunate event during our stay was out of the hotels control  The city has a planned water shut off which interfered with our ability to get ready in the morning  It seemed like it took hours for the rusty water to clear out of the system  But it did give me an additional appreciation of the very large bathroom with a large arate enclosed shower and top notch hardware  Toiletries were very high quality  I wish the management had been of greater assistance  All they offered were two small bottles of their house label water Lunch downstairs was a good bargain but was of just okay quality Location is on de la Montagne but seemed to be a little on the edge of the most desirable segment of this street  
P => First Class Gorgeous A most hospitable staff and concierge made this stay worthwhile  The room service was excellent and quick  Bath amenities were superb and included a quotrain showerquot which was delightful  Lots of interesting magazines were near the tv in the sitting area the bedroom tv was also very convenient The th floor room had some utility room next to it which was extremely loud and woke me up every single evening   several times a night  That was very disturbing and the only negative  But a BIG negative I would not have stayed in that room but my dhter didnt want to repack Le Crystal is located close to several great pubs Rosalies and the superb Chez le Mere Michel   and two blocks from great shopping  
P => The best hotel in Montreal  by far Im not   clear how the TripAdvisor rankings work but Im sure the equation takes into account the overall number of reviews  Being only  year old Le Crystal must not have enough overall reviews because make no mistake about it this is THE nicest hotel in the city I travel to Montreal at least  timesyear and have been doing so for several years  I have yet to stay in the same hotel twice just because there has always been room for improvement  That is until now  All the previous reviews are right on the highest quality bed and linens you will experience anywhere exceptional service high class furnishings a bathroom to die for and the quietest suites ever  Even the doors to each suite are quiet  slow closing and completely sealed so absolutely no hallway noise gets through  The pool and hot tub area are beautiful  The location is central  Perfect  The only issue  be the price there are other nice hotels around although not as nice such as the Gault Germain although in need of some updating and the Loews up the street  I managed a ent price on skyauction but they will have to try to stay competitive price wise  If you can afford it well go for it just make sure you take the Metro and walk and explore the PlateauMont Royal area and not just spend your time downtown  La Colombe on Duluth  small French Bistro worth the trip to Montreal in itself 
P => Extremely comfortable with superb  star service Upon your first glance of the Le Crystal Hotel you know you are in a very good stay  The outside is very sleek and modern looking with a very nice lobby to sit in and relax  The front desk staff bellhops and car valets are right on the k everytime  ien was an exceptional pleasure at check out this morning with his true  star service  The service in the entire hotel is excellent and extremely efficient  We stayed in a deluxe king suite the entire hotel is suites which had a real nice living area with a couch and  nice leather chairs which was very comfortable for viewing one of the two flat panel tvs in the room  There is a erate bedroom with sliding doors and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in  I have stayed at many of the finest hotels around the world during my extensive business travels and I can never recall a bed as confortable  The rooms are so quiet we thought we were the only ones staying in the hotel and I knew the hotel was close to fully booked this weekend The suite also has a Nespresso coffee maker in the room which is well stocked with different coffees espresso and teas  There is a small kitchenette area of the suite with stocked refridgerator microwave plates and utensils We had a very nice view of downtown Montreal and the location is a stones throw away from the Bell Center home of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team  I was traveling with my wife and  young kids and they loved it as well  We only ate breakfast at the hotel restaraunt and it was excellent  The location is great for walking to shopping the famed quotudergroundquot shopping restaraunts and night life  This hotel is true  star gem and it is not be missed while traveling to Montreal  
P => Extremely comfortable and excellent restaurant Very large and comfortable room  Staff very freindly and co operative although not as organized or efficient as one expects in a  star hotel 
P => Service Above  I dont think Ive ever been so impressed with a hotel Hotel Le Crystal exceeded any expectations that I have ever had about ANY accommodation ever We booked this hotel incidentally on Hotwire since I was just going to a conference  We took the quotdealquot of a  star hotel for nt and this is where we ended up with a  bedroom suite What an incredible unbelievable steal This place is all about courteous service  I have several examplesWhen we arrived we couldnt seem to locate the front door  A gentleman in the hotel restaurant told us where the door was but also quickly grabbed up our luggage and escorted us through the restaurant to the hotel  He ran off so quickly I couldnt even manage to get a tip out of my purse quickly enough to show my gratitudeI forgot my toothbrush and there was one in the room within  minutes  Actually they brought I got blisters from too much walking and there were bandaids in my room within  minutes I wanted to ask a few questions about St  Johs Oratory and there was a fresh printout from their website at my door within about  minutes amazing Whenever we needed a taxi they made sure we had one   again within minutesThey answered all of our questions about getting around the city and how to take the metro  They outlined things for us on maps  If they didnt know the answer to a question they quickly found someone who did We called to ask about a noise that was occurring early in the morning and they offerred a free upgrade which we didnt take since we were already unpacked and plenty comfy to a bigger suite or free breakfast   which was wonderful  They apologized up and down Every request was met with courtesy respect and a smile  Nothing was an imposition  These people are so happy to do whatever you need  No matter what staffperson you ask for help they immediately act on it  I asked a maid for the toothbrush a waiter for directions a restaurant employee where the door was etc outside of the front desk staff and concierge  Everyone is really on their toesI also happen to be pregnant   not that many of these requests were in person  My point really is that I didnt feel like wearing dressy clothes or making up my face  I looked very casual by this hotels standards   but they didnt treat me any differently  The hotel is gorgeous  The suites are very generous in space including an enormous bathroom and shower  There are two flat screen tvs  The bed was super comfy  And EVERYTHING is within walking distance If you dont feel like walking the metro is one block away and it goes everywhere The only issue was a very loud noise associated with the plumbing that occurred in the mornings   likely associated with people showering  It would often start around am and intermittently recur for about   hours  It is loud enough to wake you  One night it happened at am which is when we called Just amazing  Nothing short of it  I would go back and pay twice as much and still feel that I got a good value  
P => Man what a nice place Well forget all the other hotels   this place was great   its pricey but if you are going on vacation forget the price  All the rooms are suites with two tvs one in the bedroom and one in the living area  If you are like me my wife and I have a tiff about what program to watch  Bring walking shoes and buy the  day pass at the metro   take the bus   the drivers are very good   you can get on and off as you please   see the city   Old town is a must  Now the bad weird people everywhere  Bring mucho money   unless youi are going to eat at Mc Donalds food is a little high   Good Luck     
P => Its all true This hotel is one of the best EVER My husband and I stayed here for  nights in  and it was the best experience ever  The staff was very nice and very attentive  Our every questions and every concern was addressed  The rooms are great  We were upgraded from the urban suite to the Superior suite without even asking  The bathroom was huge with a large shower and jackjill sinks  It was great to have the arate living and bedroom area  Speaking of the bedroom the bed was better than the Ritz of any other place we ever stayed  Its a pillow top mattress with very soft sheets and great pillows  The Jacuzzi on the k and the indoor pool are great places to relax before dinner after all the sightseeing and walking around  It is a very expensive hotel but we got a great deal through Hotwire  The hotel is located on the English speaking side walking distance to the Old Towne the Basilica the underground malls bars and clubs  There is a great Irish bar across the street The Old Orchid  If you are in the mood for an authentic French meal Chez La M re Michel is a great restaurant  The food was delicious and the service was great  Its our family owned restaurant and our waiter c has worked there for years  Dont go to Globe restaurant regardless of what anyone tells you  The service is the worst youll ever get not worth the atmosphere or the money  If you go to Montreal Hotel Le Crystal is a must 
P => Spoiled me for future visits to Montreal I visited the Crystal with my husband and young dhter and with another couple  The hotel was unable to provide us with side by side rooms as we had requested but we were just  doors apart and this was not an issue  Our room was beautiful    as described by numerous other reviewers they are all suites with arate living and sleeping quarters  Im a mattress snob and thought the mattresses at the Crystal were extremely comfortable  My dhter slept on the sofa bed which being just  didnt bother her at all    for myself my experiences lying on it when reading books at night were enough to convince me I wouldnt want to spend a whole night on it But again I wouldnt book a hotel room planning to sleep on the sofa bed    just be warned if you have picky sleepers who will be using it that it is like every other sofa bed they have ever metThe bathroom with the rainfall shower and the soaking tub was perfect  I nixed the pool on the last day for my dhter as I found the water temperature a bit cool and she was developing a cold    and she was perfectly happy playing in the warm tub instead The amenities in the kitchen were perfect with a sink plenty of space in the refrigerator for leftovers and even a microwave and kettle and toaster I think  I dont drink coffee but if I did would have loved the cappuccino maker in the rooms  My husband whos a quotregular coffeequot guy would have liked a coffee maker that made more than a demitasse at a time The pool area was beautiful filled with light from wrap around windows and much larger than I expected it to be  As stated I would have liked the water temp to be a bit warmer but my dhter certainly didnt mind it and my husband didnt seem to either  The outdoor hot tub was the biggest I have ever seen and my only wish is that it too had been a bit warmer and Im a person who usually likes to keep the hot tub under   Being outside and being Canada the air was cool enough that a couple of extra degrees in the hot tub would have been much welcomed The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and it is convenient to the Metro to go farther afield  Parking was convenient and the valet staff were all quick and courteous just be aware that they will add day to your bill for parking    as most of the other hotels in the area do as well On previous visits to Montreal we have stayed at the Hotel de la Montagne and at the Delta  The Crystal would seem to be a more expensive option but good deals were available and we would definitely choose the Crystal first for future visits all things being equal  
P => Great Holiday Weekend My wife and I just spent three nights at this wonderful hotel  We had a spacious suite non fireplace non balcony suite  We really enjoyed having  TVs so I could stay up late and unwind out in the living area while my wife slept in the bedroom area The hotel staff was all very friendly and helpful We enjoyed the rain head shower and the soaking tub The expresso machine was a nice touch and the mini bar fridge had enough room to put leftovers in it for a later heat up in the in room microwave Everything still had the new feel about it in the hotel The pool and hot tub seemed to always be busy during our stay  It would have been nicer for them to stay open a little later into the evening The only negative at all was the temperature in the room  The air conditioning claimed it would go down to  degrees celsius which would be about  degrees fahrenheit  It never got that cool especially in the bedroom  At night we opened the two large windows in the living room but because of the bed being behind a wall the breeze never really hit us and made sleeping a little too warm for us  Were the type that wouldnt mike seeing our breath when we sleep so it was a little tough on us Only other thing that caused me to leave one point off on cleanliness was a bottlecap that stayed in the same spot in the hallway for our entire stay which made us think they werent cleaning the carpets in the halls  
P => A piece of Heaven in Montreal Forget the rest   stay here We stayed at Hotel Le Crystal for a week recently and our experience was so great we felt compelled to write this review The hotel reception hallways and bedrooms were orated beautifully  The room itself was massive   had a arate living room bedroom kitchen area and a massive bathroom I was truly very impressed with the set up  The sofa in the living room was also a sofa bed  The kitchen area came with a kettle micowave coffee machine tea coffee cutlery and plates  It came in very handy a couple of times when we ided to get takeaway and relax in the room for the evening  There were  large television sets    one in the bedroom and one in the living room  The mattress and pillows were super comfy   youll feel  years younger waking upThe walk in shower had  different shower heads with excellent water pressure and a large vanity area The free newspaper at your door each morning was a very nice touch However my absolute favourite bit of the hotel was the spa area on the th floor  It was open from am pm and the use of the facilities were inclusive as part of your stay  The excellent facilities included a very large hot tub still cant stop thinking about it large swimming pool  saunas towels and recliner chairs  There were lockers in the changing room which made things even easier  There was also a gym that was open   The cleaner that was incharge of that area daily was amazing   i have never seen a man scrub and polish repeatedly with a smile Germs had no chance He left the area immaculate when he was done and would keep coming back to check on it The front desk staff were superbly helpful with everything And the free internet stations downstairs came in handy as well  In terms of value for money   i think we got way above and beyond what we paid for  We visited the Hilton Metropole for a conference while staying here and there was just no comparison Hotel Le Crystal blew it out the water   im very glad we chose to stay at Hotel Le Crystal  So absolutely thrilled and if i ever am in montreal again will definitely stay here again The location was excellent   everything was within walking distance  Getting to the hotel from the airport only cost  each  We took a coach service called LAerobus  You can buy tickets from the booth at the airport and the coach takes you into the central bus station  From there a free shuttle bus service will drop you off at Hotel Le Crystal  On the way back just call them one day in advance to make a reservation for your seat back on the coach  Otherwise you can take a taxi but will cost a lot more My only dislike about the hotel was the restaurant in that there were essentially no vegetarian options on the menu  As a result we didnt have any meals in the hotels restaurant  There was an amazing vegetarian restaurant within  minutes walking distance from the hotel called quotLe Commensalquot   which is a must go to for incredibly delicious healthy filling food Finally i think they should have supplied amp supported a Canadian Brand of toiletries shower gel shampoo etc instead of Molton Brown London products  We went to Canada to experience Canada not to be reminded of londonBut other than those  minor issues it was just lush Would happily pay all over again for another stay  Seriously forget the rest of the hotels in downtown montreal   this is the real gem 
P => Fantasic hotel  Everything first class rooms service  We stayed in a superior suite over the Easter weekend  All the rooms are suites and the room was even better than I expected  The bedroom and lounge areas are arated but a sliding door there are LCD TVs in both the bedroom and lounge with a sofa and small table in the lounge area The bathroom was enormous with twin sinks a wide and deep bath and arate walk in shower There was a small modern well equipped fitness room  With pool sauna rooms and there was a k but it was too cold to check it out but looked nice We eat in the hotel restaurant on the night we arrived rather than search out somewhere else as it was late the food amp service were very good and the hotel bar is small but nice for a nightcap The staff were very friendly and the front desk was very helpful with very good restaurant recommendations and even offering to book my onward train tickets Very much recommended for anyone visiting Montreal  
P => first class After much research my husband and I chose Hotel le Crystal for our trip to Montreal  We read the reviews and were not worried about our choice however we were not prepared for the first class treatment we received  The front desk staff were friendly and gracious  We just had to ask the question and they had the answer and if they didnt they found the answer for us  The suite we stayed in was large and airy with an espresso machine and a variety of flavours to choose from  The bathroom was huge and the beds were comfortable  I dont know why this hotel is not listed in the top  hotels in Montreal  It has a great location and the best staff I have ever dealt with in my life  And weve been to Walt Disney World a few times where the staff are excellent  I stopped after checking out to let the front desk know how impressed we were  We will go back over and over if they keep giving this kind of service  
P => The Best Birthday Treat We stayed at Le Crystal at the end of ch and the website and all the reviews as wonderful as they are dont do this outstanding hotel justice  It was a treat from beginning to end   from the early check in to the chocolate covered strawberries to the amazing service to the room service request to bring up champagne glasses  china for coffee cake etc   all done with extreme professionalism and friendliness  The staff are absolutely the best We were there for my birthday   we were originally given a free upgrade to the Superior Suite but my son treated us to an additional upgrade to the Deluxe Suite   and what a treat it was  Ten floors up with incredible views fabulous sitting room we had  people there for drinks and hors douevres and it was very comfortable lovely mini kitchen incredibly comfortable bed and luxury bathroom  By the way we got a super rate through Expedia We had fun being tourists in our own city and enjoyed a couple of hours soaking in the roof top hot tub and sunning ourselves on the k   who knew wed be able to do that in Montreal in ch Didnt have time to sample the Spa but we were given a tour and its really beautiful I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat and hope to go back again  
P => Beautiful and comfortable Hotel and room was impeccable   great style clean chic and functional  I actually stayed here twice in early  and loved it both times  Cleanliness absolutely spotless everywhere including the gym which was great by the way since it had a great view and state of the art machines Service polite and courteous from the front desk to the bellboy  Location located right in the downtown core so it was easy to walk everywhere from St  Catherines St to the Bell Center which was just right across the street Value expensive but worth every penny as the rooms were just wonderful and so comfortable and stylish  Bathrobes were a great touchRooms as Ive said again and again they were just fantastic  I have never stayed at a nicer hotel and Ive stayed at my share of Fairmonts and equivalent hotels Overall Would return again and again and recommend it to everyone   just make sure youre willing to take a hit in the wallet 
P => Honeymoon at Le Hotel Crystal The hotel was beautiful  The service and staff was impeccable  They went out of their way to make the room perfect for my honeymoon  Claudine at the front desk is an angel and James the Valet should be the new consierge he helped us with every place we wanted to see  I would stay at the Crystal again and again  
P => Absolutely fabulous  Le Crystal is just absolutely perfect  I was there for three days with my sister and mother for a girls weekend and we have officially made it our retreat hotel in Montr al  We won t stay anywhere else but here from now on First the guest service was outstanding  The guys at the front desk were tripping over themselves to help us in an yway  Our flights arrived very early  a m  in Montr al so we arrived at the hotel very early  Not expecting to check in but to leave our luggage and perhaps freshen up a little  We were provided a pass to the pool and spa on the th floor where we used the ladies change room to get ready for a day of shopping  When we left the front desk asked for my cell number so they could call me when our room was ready  They said it would be around  p m  They called at  a m  We were still up on Sainte Catherine s which is one block away from Le Crystal  We made our way back to the hotel around  p m  and checked in Our room was great  We had a superior king suite  There was a huge soaker tube in the bathroom with a nice shower complete with Suisse rain shower head  We found the room cosy and perfect for three ladies getting away for the weekend We visited the outdoor rooftop hot tub every day  The Jacuzzi was just the icing on the cake for this beautiful hotel  Tip in ch the sun hits the hot tub between  p m  and  p m  
P => Beautiful and modern hotel but happy I wasnt the one who paid  I stayed there with  other friends in one of the suites I think the hotl only has suites    but I might be wrong  After my friends prom her father got us a room so we could have a good time the  of us together  The hotel was built in the last years and it shows  Its simplicity adds to it  The outdoor spa on the th floor offers a great view of the city  
P => Great hotel great location I got this hotel on Hotwire for a steal  It was a great hotel location is wonderful we walked to everything good restos near by  Room was lovely had the lowest category still two rooms two tvs bath and shower  Did not eat in hotel brought breakfast with us as there is a small fridge microwave kettle and dishes etc  Free WIFI great pool and hot tub area  Was very very clean  Loved the Molton Brown toiletries  Beds and bedding were great quality Would stay there agin in a heartbeat  Much nicer than the Fairmont Queen Eloizabeth just up the street Staff were friendly and very helpful had a few issues with the fridge and they were up fixing it in no time at all  
P => The Best in Town My husband and I spent our first wedding anniversary at Hotel Le Crystal and it was amazing Let me just tell you this hotel is GORGEOUS The rooms are fabulous modern and spacious  The location of the hotel is steps away from fantastic shopping excellent restaurants and the Bell Center  The staff are incredible every single person working in that hotel provided top notch service I even loved the line of bath amp body products they had in the room Molton Brown from London  The attention to detail in this hotel is evident everywhere you look Bond amp AlexOttawa ON 
P => New favorite We are in Montreal at least  times a year and have now stayed at the Crystal at least  times now and I love it  Rooms are crisp and clean   very modern  I recommend it highly  Very convenient to Bell Center as well as St Catherine shopping  Breakfast in the hotel is pretty mediocre   but there are a million other places to go  Front desk staff is a little bit of the helpless quotnot my jobquot variety but the parkingbell desk is quite capable and friendly  
P => Central Chic soo Montreal Went there on a business trip and I loved it soo much great staff goergeous suites  Loved the espresso machine in the room and the arate living room Cant believe all the rooms in the hotel are that great and I had the cheapest on top of thatAnyways I would recommend it to anyone coming to Montreal  
P => Oh My God loved it I dont know what it takes to make this hotel   but thats where it should be  This is the nicest hotel overall I have ever stayed in  The hotel is about  year old located between St  Catherines and Renee Levesque across from the Bell Center great location  The staff was amazing accomodating and friendly  My suite had a huge bathroom stand up shower and jet tub a kitchen area a little living room area with a swedish foam couch a microfibre and faux fur throw a arate bedroom with a swedish foam topped mattress so comfy a nice desk bathrobes slippers  flatscreen tvs   I could go on  I could live here  The gym was nice and new slight mildew smell  Hopefully they can keep the price reasonable up the quality and cleaniness and updates as needed  
P => Amazing Hotel This hotel is amazing  The staff is so friendly  We were able to check into our hotel at am instead of pm which was amazing because we drove from  hours away and were faster than what we had expected  We were in our rooom for about an hour and the front desk called to advise there was a plumbing issue in our room and we had to be moved but that we were going to be upgraded to a larger suite with no extra charge  After they came and helped us move all of our luggage and we were in our new room for a couple of hours they sent up a tray of fruit and cheeses  Absolutely amazing  The hotel rooms are beautiful  The rain shower and bath are amazing  The outside hot tub is breathtaking and the pool is beautiful too  The atmosphere is just unbelievable and I cant say enough about this hotel 
P => Magnificent Wow I cant say enough about this hotel  Very classy and elegant  The staff were super friendly infact they even helped me with some extra caricular activities that most wouldnt  The layout of the rooms is very nice and sound proof to all others  Its located right accross the road from the Centre Bell which was the reason for our stay  It is still very central in terms of walking to main shopping area and tons of places to eat all around  It was also grey cup weekend and seen alot of players and management at the hotel who were all just as friendly  We asked for a late check out as our flight wasnt until evening and they had no problem doing that for us as well  This was the nicest room ive stayed in and definetly lives up to its  star rating  I would recomend this to anyone and everyone our group of four was between   years old and everyone of us couldnt think of one negative thing about this hotel  
P => Wow Great experience great location I had the superior room and let me tell you it was fantastic for sure I will stay there again 
P => A polished diamond From the moment we pulled up to the door I knew we would not be disappointed by le Crystal  It is a beautiful modern hotel   elegant yet comfortable and affordable  It is well located within Downtown Montreal a five minute walk to the Metro a ten minute walk to Old Montreal and a two minute walk to fabulous restaurants and shopping  But what I think sets le Crystal apart from the other quotboutiquequot hotels in Downtown Montreal is the staff  Every employee with which we interacted was friendly and always ready to be of help  The housekeeping staff kept the room immaculate stopping by early in the evening to provide fresh towels if needed  Worthy of special mention is the head concierge Luc  He made us feel like VIPs by planning our sightseeing booking a reservation at a very popularbusy restaurant and locating a special souvenir I had my heart set on  Luc really made our stay that much more enjoyable  My wife and I look forward to once again being guests of le Crystal  
P => LOVE the Hotel Hotel Le Crystal has to be the best hotel I have ever been   beautiful lobby and beautiful room I emailed the hotel conceirge a few weeks in advance to let her know that the Montreal stay is to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and asked if we could have a room upgrade she responded promptly and told me that everything will be taken cared of  When we arrived they already had the note in their computer we were able to check in early and was sent to a room with a private balcony They also surprised us with desserts  birthday wishes when we came back from dinner that night  Best of all all the above were at no cost to usIndoor pool amp outdoor hot tub on the th floor is a must go It feels absolutely amazing in the warm water looking at Mont Royal while its  degree out Outdoor hot tub is open everyday regardless of weather condition according to the lifeguard   so itll be perfect even in the winter Room is spacious and equipped with a beautiful bathroom mini kitchen microwave espresso machine etc and  flat screen TVs with  channels  Free WiFi so bring your laptop I thought the hotel was the best part of Montreal and really enjoyed our time there  
P => Great New Montreal Hotel As of booking for a y  stay Le Crystal was the newest hotel in Montreal  To my knowledge the Quebec government s tourist bureau gives a  star rating to six to eight hotelsmotels in Montreal  The Le Crystal correctly received a  star rating because the facility is outstanding the rooms as accurately shown on the hotel web site are palatial and luxuriously equipped while the staff aims to please and correct any problems  We want to specifically thank concierge Valerie for her assistance Our deluxe suite had a living room arate bedroom with safe and great dimmer controlled lighting except in the bathroom multiple closets that were as large as a room and an amazing bathroom of two sinks double bathtub and a arate glass stall shower with multiple shower heads The hotel s outdoor hot tub on the th floor balcony provided a grand view and adjoins the pool and a small gym  There are new treadmills cross training machines and other exercise equipment We mention quibbles which should not take away from the general outstanding nature of the hotel  So please do not read these quibbles as major issues  For example and oddly various suites and rooms have different facilities  One cannot discern the amenities at electronic booking  It appears to be hit or miss as stated by hotel staff whether a suiteroom has an electric stove or not in the kitchenette has a tub or not double sized and deep to fit two has a balcony or not has multiple closets or not all suitesrooms have ample closet space  Concierge Valerie helped visit rooms and pick an available another suite with both the tub and a kitchen with stove The restaurant seemed to be training kitchen and wait staff as well as still underdevelopment  The food and wine lists are promising Live jazz at night would have been nice especially during the week of the Montreal Jazz Festival Le Crystal provided the highest quality and numerous soaps lotions towels bedding blankets etc  that some guests asked to purchase to take home during our stay  However and be because of confusion from the plethora of luxury it was hit or miss if we got replacements for some finished bath salts some soap etc While all suitesrooms have one or two H D  TVs we could not get one of the few available DVD players  The DVD players were assigned to other guests  We were told to wait for a return that did not happen in the six nights we stayed  Neither could we get simple wires to connect our lap top to the HD TVs  Such seems silly when suites retail for  to   Yet better to have spent time sharing the amazing tub and out on the town than watching movies Another review griped about the bathroom lighting  Yes it would have been nicer to dim the bathroom lights for a romantic soak in the amazing bath  Such would be a slight quibble given the luxury of the overall suite Le Crystal is close to the Montreal Art Museum that merits a visit  The location i near two Metro subway stops in a corporate center part of town  However a brief walk or ride probably is required for most tourist stops  Yes we hope to stay again at Le Crystal Hotel  
P => Crystal is Nearly Flawless Great building awesome location excellent service the Crystal is hard to beat in Montreal  The location is very close to the party atmosphere of Crescent street and shoppingnightlife of St Catherine but the property itself is a chic and sophisticated retreat when youve had too much of the local scene and want to relax  We especially liked the th floor poolhot tub with a view of the city and Mount Royal  We will be back 
P => not much to complain We booked an Urban Suite in this hotel apartment for four nights  We were quite satisfied The hotel is convenient located one block away from the Crescent street  where there are many restaurants  We did not use the parking service of the hotel as it was only available for valet parking and it cost  per night  We parked our car at one of the Stationnement EM which was only about  meters away for  for four nights  We found it was easier for us in and out as we wish  The Urban suite we stayed was different from the one showed on the hotels website still the room was clean and spacious  There were a lot of drawers and storage space pillows cushions and towels  Also there are two flat screen tvs one in the bed room and one in the living room  In general we were happy with the service of the hotel however there was some confusion with the bottled water provided on the counter  The first day I checked in I asked the reception whether the water on the counter was complimentary  I had been told that the one on the counter is free and the ones in the mini bar are not which I thought it was understandable and it should be  But we got billed for a couple of times for consumption of the water on the counter  One bottle of water costs   After I made a complain the hotel erased all the charge  Though I did not use the facility but I had a quick visit of the swimming pool and the gym  It was on the th floor  The swimming is indoor with floor to ceiling windows so it is quite bright the hot tub is outdoor on the big balcony with a nice view of the skyscrapers and the Mont Royal  We enjoyed our stay at Le Crystal  We would like to stay here next time if we can get a good price again 
P => Fabulous Hotel I recommend it  This is a beautiful hotel in a great location in downtown Montreal right by the Bell Centre  The rooms are modern clean comfortable spacious and nicely orated  The service was great and the restaurant was delicious  A great place for couples  
P => Lovely New Hotel We had a fabulous two night stay at Le Crystal  We received an upgrade upon check in and the room was spacious and well appointed  The amenities were a big plus Nespresso machine Molton Brown bath products soft robes foam mattress free Wi Fi flat screen tvs in both the sitting room and bedroom indoor pool and free gym  The room and lobby were spotless and the staff were gracious and efficient  The location was ideal and in walking distance to old town shopping and the museums  We got a great rate by contacting the hotel directly and doubt that well be able to get such a good deal in the future as this new hotel catches on  
P => A wonderful upscale hotel with an awesome staff and amenities I found this hotel using tripadvisor com and after staying there all I can say is what a wonderful find  It ranks up there with Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties youll find in the US  By the way there is a Rtiz in Montreal and it is horrible   it is not a quotrealquot Ritz and not affiliated with the real brand avoid it if you can  I originally planned on staying there until I found out about the Crystal  The Crystal hotel is located right in the heart of Montreal within walking distance to tons of shopping across the street from the Bell Centre and blocks from the famous restaurantclub district  Upon arrival we we warmly greeted by the professional and helpful staff  From the moment we arrived and throughout our  night stay we were impressed by the or amenities and staff  The room had both high speed and wired complimentary internet two flat screen TVs large bathroom high end coffeeexpresso machine microwave refrigerator and arate bedroom and sitting area  The gym was nice and had great views of the Bell Centre   plenty of equipment and very up to date  They have an outdoor area with a hot tub   their pool is saltwater and located indoors adjacent to the hot tub area arated by a glass wall  All of the exercise areas are located near a full service Spa which is actually independent of the hotel   my wife used the spa extensively and had a great experience  Our stay at the Crystal and Montreal was made even more special with the help of the hotels awesome Concierge staff   Valery was awesome she provided great dining nightlife and shopping recommendations even getting us on guest lists for hard to get into nightclubs and reservations at the happening eateries  What I really appreciated is that she provided genuine feedback on where to go and where to avoid   unlike many other experiences with concierges which Ive found send you to standard tourist traps where they get free dinners and benefits commission for themselves in return for referring business To sum it up this place is awesome and a great value as well   the rates on their website are very reasonable and you wont find a nicer place at a better price in Montreal  If you have a Platinum AMEX Card and use them to for the reservation you might save   but thats about it  
P => Shiny and new with a few flaws We found a great deal for Le Crystal on Hotwire com and were very impressed by the design of the place  The location is great convenient to two metro stations within  min walk of the Old City one block to the shopping on Ste  Catherine and if youre in town for a concert or sports a block from the Bell Centre  The top half of the building is luxury condos the lower  floors are the hotel  Valet parking is available a bit pricey and there are numerous lots within a block of the hotel  Wireless internet is available at no extra charge in the rooms  All the rooms are suites  We had the smallest type the Urban which was enormous compared to many city hotel rooms  The bathroom was especially large with double sinks a soaking tub and a large glass shower  The seating area had a convertible sofa the kitchenette was more than adequate microwave sink refrigerator the bedroom area was spacious and had its own sliding door and the bed was firm  There are two TVs one in the bedroom another in the seating area and large windows that open to let in fresh air    although the view on the south west side of the building is nothing special There were a few disappointments about the place  The front desk staff while friendly made several significant mistakes during our  night stay  They lost a note that was supposed to be waiting for me upon my arrival  When I was unable to find ice on my floor I phoned the concierge who said theyd send some ice up to my room  After waiting  minutes I took the ice bucket down to the front desk myself and asked for the ice  The room has an espresso maker with small coffee pods but these were not replenished each day I told the front desk in the afternoon of our second day that we were out of coffee and was assured theyd put some in the room  But as you might have guessed already we were still out of coffee in the morning so again I had to go to the front desk to ask for something  This lack of follow through if not negligence in the case of the lost letter is simply not befitting a hotel of this caliber  We were also a bit surprised to learn after the fact that the hotel charges over  per local telephone call Overall Le Crystal is a very nice place and we would consider returning again but only if I found a bargain rate  I would not be likely to book a room at their regular rates  
P => Will be the best in the Downtown Core The only reason I did not give it  stars is that they are still undergoing some growing pains Elevator problems and the first night the AC seized Nice brasserie and excellent  course meal for  Book it in  months    
P => Great Stayed mid y for  nights  adults  teenagers First of all when booking I taked via email to the head of reservations     he was fantastic he even had a cake sent up for my wifes birthday   Everything we asked for was done and the whole hotel is new and very good  Staff are even better  One slight problem in the room a member of staff was there in  minutes to fix it   The pool and spa are just as good as the rest the food is good as well If you are looking for a hotel in Montreal stop looking and stay here  
P => Fabulous We travel every few months  We love  star hotels all over the world and this hotel did not let us down You are  blocks from shopping and a  minute walk from Od Montreal  The staff was pleasant and very helpful  We celebrated my parents anniversary there and the staff did more than enough to make their stay overly pleasant  The rooms are big the bathrooms are wonderful the food was nice breakfast only  We were in the gym every day and swam tons as well  The gym is small to be expected but the equipment is new and in great shape  We do not have one single complaint We will definitely go back again  
P => Brand New Luxury Hotel What a great find    Brand new hotel with great location  Great dining and Old Montreal all with in a short walk  Hotel staff extrememly helpful and courteous  As I was concerned about the language barrier between French and English all staff members spoke both Actually most people in the city speak both  The subway system is also easy to navigate and safe Room was pleasantly quotEuropeanquot in or  Bathroom was extremely large and spotless  Large flat screen tvs and compimentary espresso machine are nice touches  Pool and outdoor k on the  floor is a great place to view the skyline and watch the sun go down We got a good deal from the company website but imagine the cost will go up as soon as this place catches on with visitors to Montreal  Definitely would stay here again  No complaints    
P => Loved Le Crystal From the fresh contemporary or to the helpful and polite staff to the fabulous bathrooms this hotel was a constant delight The hotels location couldnt be better  Its close to downtown shopping and the Bell Centre Place des Arts is a little farther but still within comfortable walking distance The rooms are tastefully appointed spacious and very clean  The bathrooms feel luxurious with a rain shower and telephone shower combination lots of thick towels and generous supplies of fantastic Molton Brown products The housekeeping staff was amazing in every way  They were efficient courteous and polite  The concierge and front desk staff were friendly and more than happy to provide assistance  If youre looking for a hotel with a suited doorman this isnt it the service at this hotel is prompt polite and understated  
P => Simply Awesome at the price We spent  nights towards the end of    I was expecting some kind of catch given the price and pictures but I was truly pleasantly suprised The lobby is every but as oppulent as in the pictures and the rooms excellently appointed with modern furnishings  A great bathroom with a double wash basin lovely shower and a great deep bath  The little kitchenette was great as we were travelling with my  year old dhter  Other good features free internet access in the business centre and lovely views from the enclosed pool on the rd floor Would definitely stay again 
P => Loved the bathroom I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for comfort in a great location  The superior room is a good size and the bathroom in particular is well stocked with generous Molton Brown products and plenty of towels always a good sign  We didnt try the restaurant and couldnt find the bar if there is one so cant comment on that  Staff were friendly enough My only complaint was the drilling and hammering that started at  in the morning which was too early by anyones standards  We also could not find the do not disturb sign until the last day its a button by the doorAll in all a lovely place to stay and the location is perfect  
P => Good hotel for business travellers I stayed here for  nights is    I had room number   As the other people have said it was a fabulous room  It was a little on the dark side and certainly felt very corporate rather than relaxing  Beds are very comfortbale but have one of those annoying wooden skirts bits which I kept hitting my shins on The staff were very efficient and very friendly  I had a problem with my air conditioning and when they couldnt fix it straight away they moved my room with no fuss The room prices were worth every penny but the hotel itself I felt was expensive   the resturant and cafe for example The pool and spa were great but I didnt have time to use them Room service was not vry good i e  limited choice and wasnt  hours which was a pain The hotel is all non smoking I wouldnt stay here again myself but hats because I want hotel with a vibe and it didnt have one but for business travellers it would be perfect   as long as they didnt want  hour room service  
P => NOT A HOSPITALITY QUALITY MORE SERVICED APARTMENT LIKE The location is pretty good  Room is spacious with arate kitchenliving area  There was a construction at the time we stayed  It started pretty early around AM and the whole room was vibrating and noisey  The concierge is not experienced  If you are looking for a place to relax with great concierge service this is not the right hotel  For corporate stay this will be ideal  
P => Flawless service but a little corporate Im giving this hotel an above average rating mainly for the enormous bathroom and the overall size of the suite along with pristine cleanliness and extremely courteous professional staff  Also I dropped a hint that it was my husbands th birthday and they graciously sent up some chocolate covered strawberries on the house which was appreciated  We also liked the modern or concept although it did have a sterile corporate quality  The pool area is beautiful  Didnt try the spa but its a convenient asset  The only terrible thing about this hotel is the hideous lighting in the bathroom We had a huge tub and arate shower double sink everything sleek and white    but the glaring cold lighting made it feel like a hospital or laboratory  On the other hand theyre generous with those fragrant Molton Brown toiletries  The bedroom lighting wasnt too cozy either  You cant get movies on demand strangely    they offer only standard cable tv    but you can request a dvd player and movies from their library  Fine hotel overall with some quirks  Not a great choice for a real Monteal cultural experience but probably perfect for business travelers  
P => Definitely worth a visit The Crystal is several months old as of this writing and although there has been some wear and tear probably due to guests not being too careful it offers good value for the money and was the cleanest hotel Ive found in the city  We had a suite on the top floor which was quite comfortable    it was probably about  square feet  It had a living room with wall mounted flat screen television sofa coffee table a couple of chairs kitchenette with microwave toaster and Liebherr refrigerator that was amply stocked with all of the necessities from juice and water to hard liquor  With   baths the master suite had a king sized bed flat screen television double bowl bath vanity with arate tub and shower  All in all pretty comfortable  Not top of the line finishes a lot of ceramic mixed with some crema fil ble although I was pleasantly surprised to see the Liebherr refrigerator and Franke undermount sink in the kitchen area   The shower had a rainshower head and arate hand held so theyre definitely trying to make you comfortable  The bed was firm which I liked and the room was quiet so I was pleased  This is a good hotel for business travelers or those who likeneed a bit of extra space for kids  The standard rooms are really quite spacious too so Id recommend considering one of those  We opted for the suite only because we were offered a pretty good rate for it otherwise I would have booked the standard room  I would definitely consider returning  The bar is nice and overall I think the hotel offers good value for the money  Perhaps theyll hike up the prices once theyve gotten more established but in the meantime Id give it a try  
P => I Love Le Crystal too I took my  children ages   and  for a weekend and it was fabulous Although we looked scruffy from an afternoon spent tree top trekking and zip lining at Arbraska Rigaud fantastic the hotel staff was very professional and friendly  The bedrooms were a little small but gorgeous  I loved the grand elegant bathroom  If you like fresh air request a room with one of the walkout balconies  sq ft   The view might not be good but drinking an espresso from your private machine on your private balcony is pretty good The saltwater pool was rather cold but refreshing and the valet parking was reasonably priced C I think  My only complaint was the bed  It was VERY FIRM and Im used to my Tempurpedic  
P => Wow   What a hotel We loved the Crystal We were looking for a hotel to stay in Montreal for our Anniversary  After reading many many reviews online about all of the luxury hotels in Montreal W Fairmont Loews etc we ided that it would be very cool to stay in the newest luxury hotel in the city  From the pictures we were attracted to the lobby and rooms and were impressed that all  rooms are suites  We arrived early on a Friday morning into the city and they let us check in before noon  As our room wasnt ready yet superior they upgraded us to a deluxe room  Im not sure why you would want anything more than a deluxe room    it was fantastic Very large  or so sq feet arate bedroom very nice living room and beautiful bathroom  As the hotel is brand new it felt like staying in a model studio apartment    very very niceThe pool and workout facility were both very nice and a great view from the th floor  The restaurant in the hotel is great as well and very good food One of the best parts of the hotel though was the exceptional service we received  The concierge was great Luc and very helpful  He suggested dinner at Europea which is just down the street and winner of Chef of the year for   It was one of the nicest dinners we have ever hadOverall as you can tell we loved our stay at the Crystal and would stay again tomorrow if we could 
P => Wow The hotel is amazing and beautiful  For a U S  government business traveler using government per diem it is a great price and located within a short walk of many restaurants and entertainment  I received great service and the staff were more than polite  I would stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel without question  Check out their website for great photos of their rooms which are surprisingly enough very accurate  
P =>   I Love This Place    I have been in a lot of great hotels but this is one of themost amazing  I Love the building design wow The hotel is beautiful inside and out the staff is excellent and very professional and the location is very convenient right downtown I will definitely be back this summer    
P => Excellent Outstanding in everyway  I have stayed at many places in downtown Montreal and this one for me is perfect  Every room is spacious and comfortable with all new modern ammenities and very clean  The service is outstanding and friendly  Their indoor pool just opened this weekend and is beautiful  Great location as well  Highly recommend it for anyone staying in the area  
P => Wow what a beautiful place I am always nervous staying somewhere that hasnt been opened very long but took a chance since it was referred to by a good friend and the price was right What a beautiful classy place The or was just great with high end furniture and the service outstanding  Its location couldnt have been better  I was in for a Hockey game which was right across the street at the Bell Centre  All the Best restaurants are within a  block radius  Unfortunately the spa wasnt ready for opening so I didnt get to enjoy it  I will have to try it upon my return in  
P => New property in Montreals business district This condohotel should be completed by ch    Spapool on  floor has wall of windows for natural light but view is of parking lots and roof tops  The k will have  season access to a hot tub and view of Mount Royal  Very nice  There is an exercise room with cardio and weight machines  Floor  is a half floor owing to the pool on the floor above  That said rooms on this floor offer guests a large balcony Floors   Rooms x are king sized suites with large sitting area pull out sofa coffee table two leather seats and quot plasma tv small desk glass table and  chairs  Wet bar excellent espresso maker and mini bar  Bed room has sliding smoked glass doors with its own tv  Bathroom has arate tubrain shower double sinks and Molton Brown toiletries  The room and hotel utilize contemporary styling stone stainless steel fittings and white oversized subway tiles in bath but is very warm and comfortable  Rooms x are corner rooms with a rounded sitting area providing dramatic light  Same amenities as above in this very attractive King sized beds offering a hotplate built into the wet bar and dining table for six  Room x are the smallest and be joined together with Room x for a two room suite by closing an outer door to the hallway  Room x has the same amenities as x but have fire place with a flat screen tv mounted to the wall above a hot plate and a small balcony facing southwest along Blvd  Rene Levesque Rooms x X x and x can be joined together by closing a common door  Room x has a small balcony and a view west up Rue de la Montagne of Parc du Mont Royal  The balconies are convenient to smokers because all the rooms are non smoking  The concierge Luc Lavoie a member of Les Clefs dOr will arrange for catering from any restaurant in town if you wish to entertain in your suite or simply dine in alone  Hell also stock your room with milk and oj for the kids if you call before you arrive  He also has DVD players and a few video disks for kids  It is conveniently located to downtown the Bell Centre and Crescent Street and all its restaurants  La Queue de Cheval offering premium dry aged steaks is a block away

P => Great for Some Not for Others This hotel is probably different than most you have ever been to  It has some unique suites at a reasonable price  We booked a double room for our  kids and then treated ourselves to one of the themed suites  The double rooms are clean and furnished with the std   star amenities  The themed suite was large clean and outrageously orated  Check out their website they have a picture of each suite  As far as I can tell they are exactly as pictured  at least ours was  It had a great sound system with speakers all over the room  They had unique mood lighting king size beds nice stereo refrigerator etc  You could not find a comparable room in downtown Montreal for less than  per night  It had a double jacuzzi in the middle of the room with a arate glass shower  It was very romantic as you can imagine You do not want to have kids in the room with you  there is no privacy They are meant for couples  The double room did have a arate shower however  My wife loved the room and did not want to leave  The kids will like it if they have a arate room  There is a nice outdoor pool also Bottom line  Check out the photos on their website  What you see is what you get A few words of warning   They advertise a continental breakfast  This consists of a muffin and warm orange juice  Coffee is from the machine for    Anyway we found the best breakfast in the world right accross the street at Chez Cora a local Quebec chain  We want to go back to Montreal just for the breakfast there You will love it there There is no restaurant at all in the hotel but there are numerous within walking distance  We tried  and they were all excellent   This location is about  miles north of downtown Montreal which is where you want to go if you are a tourist  You should choose this hotel only if you have a car   The hotel also has an adult porno channel that runs continuously  We asked the manager to shut it off for the duration of our stay which she gladly did for us  We could not block the channel on the TV in our kids room   The hotel appears to be a quotswingersquot hotel  They offer wine and champagne bottles for sales in the lobby  I dont think that it is but it is definitely different  If this was in the Intercontinental it would be a Master Suite at  per night   The pillows were a little hard  You  want to bring your own Overall this was a friendly well managed hotel  We enjoyed our stay and would love to go back for a second honeymoon  Montreal is a very romantic and interesting city  We toured all of Eastern Canada and liked Montreal the best  This hotel  not be for everyone but great for honeymooners adventurers romantics etc  Not for small kids 
P => 
P => Francoise Allaire Goalies Hotel of Choice Yes its close and its really the nicest amenities for a hotel so close to the rink  We have been going to the hockey camp for about seven years now and always come the first week of the camp  Every year we see the same families of goalies staying at the hotel Le Rivage and as goalies sign onto minor leagues you just seem to stay in touch with them  The hotel becomes a gathering place after ice  When you get here its like a big family which is great once you get toknow people year after year some days you sleep late cause another family will take your goalie with them early in the morning some days you bring their kids back from the rink with you back to he hotel after ice  The Ialian restaurant across the street Pizzadelic is awesome and we make sure we go at least once every year  The breakfast at the hotel is ent an assortment of fresh baked muffins although unked not a problem unless you are allergic to chocolate like I am cereal bagels raisin bread cofee tea milk and orange juice The rooms are orated with quality furnishings some rooms are more expensive and upscale and offer some strange amenities like a jacuzzishower with an exposed view behind a big glass wall  You can flip the wooden blinds on the outside of the glas from the inside of the room to accomodate your fancy of chosing at the moment whatever it  be I guess Other fancy rooms have a bath tub out on the floor in the middle of the room and some even have a toilet placed in the middle of the room I dont know if I would want to ave time of it on te toilet if you know what I mean while someone is laying in the bed watching or worse be th one laying in the bed smeling the person on the toilet What ever happened to Feng ShuiSince I have been here for seven consecutive years really it is the most convenient but the place sort of lacks in common sense in many ways  We ided this year to avoid having the maids clean the room since the do not disturb sign goes un noticed  I had my do not disturb sign up and the maid ided to lay her tablet and walkie talkie on the table outside my door  When the front desk was loking for her down the hall she let the walking talkie ring with volume so loud that I thought I was waking to a fire alarm  When I opened the door to see what it was I answered it and asked that they tell her not to leave a lujd wakie talkie next to a room that has a do not disturb sign hangin on the door which just so happened to be across from the door that said quotplease respect the silence of the other guestsquot they said they would take care of it  An hour after I drifted off again I started to hear a loud conversation between two maids both at opposite ends of the hall and one of them being just outside my door  I got up out of bed to have a word with the maid but by the time I got to the door she vanished I got back to bed only to hear that walkie talkie blasting again I had to call the desk and tell them I had just drove for two days and needed my sleep  Late that evening I had a friend call the hotel and ask for my rom number and the desk person told them quotcould you hold on for just one moment please Ill be right with youquot In French He does not speak French so he heard dead silence and thought he was hung up on so he called back and the same thing occured until my friend sent me an email and thought the desk person kept hanging up on him  I had to cal te desk and let them know he did not speak French  I mean really if we were local we wouldnt need a hotel we are tourists and we dont speak French One day the maid ided to wipe down the alarm clock and turned it on apparently it was preset at  for someone  As luck would have it it just happened to be the day AFTER the camp was over when we ided to stay an extra day and sleep late one day before we left town  All week long we were getting up at am for the camp so we actually ot up earlier by paying for an extra day  When I talked with management they offered nothing A few times our reservation was missing a few times they tried to give us a smoking room when we requested a non smoking room but made up for it with a nicer room and a cheaper than usual rate but more than what we booked for  The parking lot is hard to get in and out of they finally got internet in the rooms it used to be only in the lobby but they block so many web sites that some goalies reported hat they couldnt even play some of their games on sites they frequent  Many of the electrical socktes in the lobby and in the hotel rooms dont work others have access that is covered with large heavy furniture  The laundry room is stacked p and practically has a line for under gear to be washed best remedy is to was it and lt it dry from the hot summer night in the rental car windows cracked over night and they dry fine by morning or if you make friends with someone staying in the dorm across he lot from the rink they are cheaper and much larger units  Sure there are glitches but the convenience is worth it to deal with it all that isnt  
P => Cute Place Just got back from Canada  Drove up for a bachlorette  Some people stayed at family house my sister and i stayed in this hotel since it was about   minutes from the house  check in was easy the hotel is small  floors  The room was very dark when i opened my blinds for some light it was a view of the parking lot  There is a pool looked cute didnt go in since i went back to family house  their pool  there was a quotcontinental breakfastquot bagles toast muffins juice and coffee  but it was convienent and good  located on a main road so thats cool if you are driving Power went out when i was blowdrying my hair  but quickly came back on when i called  the front desk 
P => Unique This hotel is the perfect hotel for a quotromanticquot evening  I have been there several times  It is a very unique concept  Book a theme room you will enjoy garantee  Bring a lunch in the room you will not want to leave  
P => Been here many times and planning to go again I have been to this Hotel  times in my life and had  of my friends go and loved every minute of it  We have rented a regular room a Jr Suite a Le Rivage Suite the House and the Diablo  I rented the house for my entire family could be together when they came up and visited and it fit  people nicely with a huge dining room and kitchen  There was plenty of space for everyone to hang out The diablo was probably the nicest suite I have ever stayed at before  floors with the bedroom on the second floor and everything was better than it shows in the pictures  The only way to do it justice is to be in there I am excited about going to the Paramount soon  I am sure the experience will be great as always  If you want to do something better for you partner or just need a place to stay outside of Montreal this is perfect for everyone  
P => Perfect I just came back from a trip to Hemmingford parc safari  Since we live in Quebec city we ided to sleep somewhere close to montreal for  night  Ive searched for and hotel for more than  months and found the best place to stay near montreal in Rosemere  minutes by car  Hotel Le rivage is the nicest place where I have stayied in my entire life  Every suites are different orated with taste and amazing  We rented two rooms a rivage suite called Lindigo  It was a wonderful blue suite with a big whirpool bath next to the bed erated by a window  There are a lot of mirors everywhere in the room and on the ceilling  There are two windows next to the bed one that is facing the whirlpool bath and the other one facing the shower that has  jets  The sound for the tv comes from speakers on the ceilling  This room was very nice and the bed was comfy  They also give a continental breakfast served between  am and  amThe other room that we rent was for my parents since there were no more suites available we chose a room with a balcony At our best suprise the balcony was facing the pool The view was very nice and they could also see the river that is right next to the hotel If you dont have a view you can sit next to the river anyway  The view is amazing The hotels lobby is very chic and recent  everything is clean and the staff is very nice  Check there website and chose the room that fits you best  They also have a small house that you can rent and suites that are not attached to the hotel  I would have rent the paramount room if I had a bigger budget This place is a must see perfect in any waysDo not miss it  
P => d bile  
P => 
P => Great value  perfect location  clean  free parking  what more can you ask for I highly recommend this hotel  I was a little skeptical after reading some of the other reviews but the hotel was a great surprise  The room was a pretty good size clean and comfortable  The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful especially Roger the manager  No problem at all with the parking lot it opens right to the street disregard any concerns about safety   Free cont  breakfast delivered right on time to your room  Easy walk to old Montreal and the restaurants and pubs on St  Katherine and St  Denis streets  Great BYO restaurants on Prince Arthur St and Duluth St  Quick walk to the metro and the shops on St  Catherine St  Try the farmers ket in Little Italy by metro  If you are not a  star hotel type youll be perfectly happy  
P => Very Nice Had a very nice stay there staff very nice and helpful and i would recommend it to my friends to stay there  
P => A nasty place Its a dirty rundown hotel similar to what you can find in any seedy rundown section of downtown of any major US city  Its nowhere near to justify the night rate they charge to stay there This hotel have dirty smelly rooms with unclean bathroom and bedding sheets  There is an extremely dark narrow and dangerous passage way to the parking area in the back which is used by homeless and drug addicts  The passage way is very dark at night and you would need to maneuver just inches away from walls and other cars to park there  If you are driving an SUV it will NOT clear it  The parking area is littered with used syringes and there were a couple of addicts shooting drugs while I was parking there There is no soap and shampoo in the bathroom fortunately I had these with me  There is no closet to put clothes in  There is a very old and noisy air conditioner which ruins a sleep during the night  Sound insulation is very poor there were strange people shouting and lhing in the middle of the night in the hallway And as they say the list goes on and on   I would never recommend this hotel to anybody  
P => Best budget choice in Montreal croissants delivered to your door each morning There are few hotels that are the bargain that the Hotel Le St  Andre is  Rooms are spotless  Very quiet  Crossants and baguettes delivered to your door each morning  Just steps to the Berri Uqam metro stop   coffee shops within blocks plus a great magazine store  On the downside the rooms are a bit spartan and their is no clock radio  Friendly staff  Ive been staying here for your  Two gyms Nautilus Plus and Energie Cardio within  blocks  If you are on a budget or dont like over paying for hotels this is your spot   If you are expecting a Westin or W this is not a good pick  
P => Nice location friendly staff and good price  I stayed this hotel one night when my second trip of montreal  there is no shampoo and soap in the bathroom but shower room was pretty large staff were friendly and helpfull  reception guy gave me a big map and told me hot spots which he recommends breakfast was only cafe and two croissants but it was taste so good  i wanted to ask them where did they get the croissant loli totally satisfide with this this hotel  
P => A place to sleep Nothing fancy  The light breakfast was adequate for my needs and the at your door delivery a real convenience  One of the maids gave a free three day Metro pass one morning  Comfortable bed clean enough to pass my own inspection each day  The quality lies between that of the Hotel Lord Berri and the cheap places near the BerriUQAM terminal  The price is fair in light of that and you cant beat the location    between the BerriQUAM and Baudry Metros  If you are gay this is right in the middle of the bars clubs and shops for that clientele  If you are not like me the neighborhood is still an interesting place to look around     Only one small problem my credit card payment was not registered or at least findable at the desk when I checked out  No real problem though and the clerk took my word for the payment  Just a brief delay handled pleasantly  
P => A boutique hotel with few pretences If youre looking for overall good value do not have exalted expectations and just need a ent place to park yourself at night the St  Andre is a generally sound choice Although Id not stayed there for several years over the long haul    more than  years    I must have lodged at the St  Andre at least a  times or more  Ive seen it go through various changes such as the redesign of the lobby but it has always retained its character as a modest friendly boutique hotel with a touch    just a touch    of European charm which  explain why it tends to be favored by foreign budget travelers The hotel has never undergone a complete reation  It always seems to have been piecemeal and theres always something thats likely to bother fastidious travelers  Housekeeping standards have varied over the years too  It always pays to ask if a room is reated or not and if you dont like stairs which floor its on  The elevator is way at the east end of the building For my most recent stay I had No   It was clean which has not been the case with all my previous visits simply furnished well lit and although on the small side by the standards of North American chain hotels had plenty of hanging and drawer space  The queen bed was firm enough although the bedding like the towels is low end stuff The CRT television delivered a good picture cable and it was possible to set it as an alarm theres no bedside clock radio  Rooms on this north side look into a grim alleyway which at night is brightly lit  Because there are cheap venetian blinds rather than drapes the room can never be blacked out  A small writing desk was needlessly cluttered with a vase of cheap artificial flowers  There were two small armchairs and a useful touch a small bar fridge  An air conditioner beneath the window is concealed behind slide panels when not in use The reated bathroom was fine  It is among those where the old bathtub has been replaced by a large tiled shower    so large in fact that it tends to cramp the rest of bathroom especially the crapper There is no hairdryer only basic soap and those rather low end towels I mentioned  Irons and ironing boards can be requested As others have mentioned sound proofing is not good  The halls and floors creak as is common in older European hotels  But then experienced budget travelers know to carry ear plugs and a blindfold can be useful too Depending on how you plan to spend your time the location is good very close to the Metro Berri UQAM and bus station  By foot you can be almost anywhere youre likely to want to visit in the downtown area within  minutes  There are plenty of restaurants along St  Catherine St immediately north of the hotel  If you turn right at the intersection youll be heading into the gay quotvillage quot Turn left and youll be headed towards the seedy red light neighborhood around St  Laurent but soon pass into a more salubrious section of this long thoroughfare  Turn north off St  Catherine at St  Denis and youll find a lively street scene with lots of cafes and small eateries  The hotel lobby is well stocked with tourist maps and informational brochures to guide you on your way And of course there is something rather charming about the hotels long standing tradition except when it briefly experimented with a breakfast room of delivering a continental breakfast to your room  If you want heartier breakfast fare you dont have to walk far to get it  And if you fancy a tipple in your room theres a liquor store only steps away heading west on St  Catherine Internet savvy travelers should have no problem finding a room here at a ent rate although in high season prices rise and the hotel can often be fully booked during one of the citys many festivals especially during the jazz festival and Gay Pride weekend yes the St  Andre appears to be very gay friendly judging by the provision of a number of free gay publications it makes available so it helps to plan ahead  In the off season you can probably get a room in the CND  range  Euro pretax  The St  Andre apparently has a high return rate among those who appreciate its unpretentious charm and who prefer to save their money for things other than a lavish hotel room  It will always have its detractors    yes there are things it could improve at a price    but clearly has also won itself a loyal clientele  
P => Recommended as a  star hotel I booked this on bonjourquebec com  I thought I was getting a deal considering it was  ked down from  regular  But after staying here I feel that the discounted price is what the regular price should be  So if youre going to book this hotel find a discounted room on bonjourquebec  I usually stay in  or  star hotels but I suppose for a  star this is absolutely suitable  There was not much to be desired in terms of the appearance of the hotel and my room  But the room was fairly clean and included the essentials  The bathroom actually looked nicer than the room  There isnt much parking and its hard to get in and out of it with the tight laneway but there is a cheap parking lot right across the street What I really appreciated about St Andre is the staff  I met three of them and they are wonderful I found them to be very friendly polite and helpful  Having my breakfast delivered right to my door in the morning was quite a surprise 
P => Totally worth staying at This hotel was absolutely fantastic  The H tel Le St Andr  is located in the Latin Quarter of Montreal  Yes the area was a little seedy but the hotel is located right in the middle of the city There is a lively scene going on  students gay posh etc  You dont need a car as most things worth visiting are either withing walking distance or a quick metro ride away  The nearest metro stop is about two blocks away  if that The service was wonderful  The front desk people were all very friendly helpful and speak both english and french  Breakfast is delivered to your door  but you have to make sure to request a delivery time at the front desk  There is a  tiny  parking lot in the back and it is free  Yes it does appear a little shady but there is a video camera in the back and the person who checked us in was watching it religiously  He knew that we had parked back there before we mentioned itWhy not  stars Well the hotel is a little shabby and is by no means luxury  However the room was spotlessly clean and I am piiicky and the beds were comfy  I was lucky enough to get a huge room but I did notice that most of the rooms are teeny tiny  I would totally stay here again  
P => Great place The hotel was great   once we got there the person at the desk was very helpful in answering our questions  There is a small free parking lot available for guests   it fits about  cars however if you are not lucky enough to get a spot   there is a parking garage right across the street  The room was not large but comfortable enough for  people  The hotel is located just a  minute walk to the subway and   min walk to downtown old town   depending on how fast you walk  The neighborhood is not fancy but is safe  The staff was very helpful in suggesting good places to have dinner  Rooms were cleaned daily and every morning you get breakfast delivered to your room  a perk that is included in the room price  
P => Well Worth the little Money Right off Saint Catherine Est colourful neighbour of Montreal full of crazyness until late in the morning  Comfortable rooms exactly worth the few dollars spent  Breakfast in bed is a nice touch  Wonderful service location location location  Perfect for the budget travellers who want to try a hotel over a hostel a bit more money but not that much more  Glorious weekend give this place a try you wont be disappointed  
P => heres the deal Staff was super nice  But     the hotel is in a not so hot location in a rough part of town  The elevator took us part of the way to our floor but you had to walk up stairs to get the room  The is no bell service so youre carrying your own bags  Breakfast is included but served in your own room as there is no real lobby or dining area  Not in walking distance of area attractions  Super limited parking  or  spaces for a  or so room hotel  Recently remodeled but still terribly sub par  We actually found worn underwear in our room If you are looking for minimal accomodations with a youth hostel esque feel this is your spot  If you have any expectations of comfort or be a hint of quaintness or luxury forget this spend a few more bucks  
P => Safe clean and convenient all for the right price  Hotel St  Andre is perfectly located with fast and easy access to the Latin quarters and gay village  Everything is in walking distance  Parking is free Room is clean and with reasonable rates Roger who greeted us at the front desk was friendly and helpful I especially loved the hardwood floors  Room included cable T V  and a great air conditioning unit Breakfast of fresh bread croissants and coffee brought to your room every morning Only issue that I had was the towels  I would bring my own next time  I will definitely be back It s not the Ritz but it s safe affordable and convenient I enjoyed both Hotel St  Andre and Montr al 
P => great hotel very convenient This is a very nice hotel and not nearly as bad as some of the reviews on here seem to imply  I stayed here for four nights with a group of  other people to spend some time in Montreal and see McGill University as prospective students  It was very clean and our room on the rd floor was newly reated  The room itself was pretty spacious the air conditioner worked well and the staff was extremely reasonable and able to provide us with an extra mattress as we were a party of  and there were only enough beds for  people  My only complaint about the staff is that they didnt seem to know much about Montreal itself in terms of tourism but otherwise they were very friendly and accommodating  As long as you bring your own map or guidebook it is no problem at all  The free breakfast in the morning was really good as well   hot croissants baguettes orange juice and tea or coffee brought straight to our room It is also in a great location   a few blocks away from St  Denis at the beginning of the Gay Village  The neighborhood was not seedy at all and it was very quiet because the hotel is down a small side street about a block from St  Catherine  I would not call it a quotRed light districtquot at all I think that further down St  Catherine this definition is plausible but not near this hotel  Obviously there were a lot of night clubs around the major streets but there was never anything to worry about we walked around at  AM and never felt in danger  It was also walking distance from a ton of interesting places such as Old Montreal the Old Port Rue St  Rue St  Laurent St  Catherine Chinatown amp etc  For further places the Berri UQUAM metro was very close and accessible at almost any hour  During the summer there was tons close by   the Jazz Festival fireworks on Canada Day as well as a HUGE variety of night clubs festivals and restaurants I normally stay in   star hotels and think that this one is just as good as the rest  It is definitely worth it for the price and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great time in Montreal 
P => great place For the price no reason to complain Excellent staff pleasant and very helpful  Good continental breakfast 
P => Not bad  I stayed in this hotel and didnt have any major problems  It did however stink of smoke but then what in Montreal doesnt As for location unless your an arsitrocrat or homophobe there is nothing wrong with it  All amenities are very close by  The hotel was clean but cramped and the staff were very friendly  There are better hotels for around the same price just across the river  I wont stay here again but if youre on a tight budget or just need a place to sleep this place will do  
P => Good value and location My fiancee and I stayed here for three nights in    A simpel but good and warm continental breakfast of bread pastry juice and coffeetea was served in the room at your requested time each morning The hotels or is a bit dark and outdated and the room was pretty small but it was very clean and had a tv and fridge  Bed was comfy and overnight noise was minimal from either within the hotel or outside  There was construction going on in the hotel basement during the day however  The front desk staff were very friendly and particularly helpful and there is free but very limited parking available in a lot right next door The neighborhood doesnt make the best first impression but after a short while anyone whos ever spent time in a city will feel more at home  But when it comes down to it you are really well located within Montreal  The main intersecting subway line is only a two minute walk and the cafes of St  Denis arent much further  Even the Old City and Chinatown are within walking distance or a short subway or cab ride  Its easy to find by car If youre going to spend a lot of time in your hotel pay more for a nicer place but if youll be out and about enjoying the city this is a good place to base yourself  
P => Great Little Hotel This is a great little hotel with freindly and helpful staff  The rooms recently reorated anare done very well  Good job all the way around including the bathrooms which are often difficult in remodelling older hotels The location is down a side street but very convenient to restaurents and entertainment  Fast access to the cross Montreal underground highway  AND they supply the parking  I had a small refrig wine racks of course in the room The breakfast is a continentall with a quite suffient brought to your room    it was right on time for meFree wireless A great small hotel well deserving of its  star status and terrific value   having stayed in several Montreal  and  stars I certainly recommend this one Booked through Montreal tourist bureau    always great service from them 
P => Great place in the Village  Ive stayed at this place at least  times    its good value for your buck  Theyve recently reated so the place looks great Rooms Clean reated   can be a little chilley but Montreal can get pretty flippin cold  Bathrooms are bit small but the water is hot  Matresses   well used   some like it soft Staff friendly amp nice     i can usually barter my room price down with the owner Location Awesome   near the metro    min walk from old mtl and right in the Village Complimentary breakfast They bring it to your door in a tray amp drop it off in the hall  The coffee is errr ok   and the croissants can be stale   but its great if you got the munchies after a nite of partying  Lots of cafes amp restaurants in the area Good value for your buck   good location   its a nice  min walk to the Plateau or the shopping drag on St Cathrines    Ive stayed in lots of other places in Mtl   and I always come back to this place    
P => Dont believe the bad reviews We stayed here from ust     The room we had was recently remodeled and very very spotlessly clean  I was a bit nervous when reading the bad reviews on this site but my fears were unfounded when we checked in and got into the room  WE stayed on the nd floor  It was simply orated and very clean  The bathroom was also very clean  The hotel staff was super friendly  Yait was right around the corner from the gay neighborhood so if any of you guys want to stay there its down the street from all the bars and clubs  There were lots of gay guysstraight families with children and single people staying there  Olderyoungeryou name it and they were there  It catered to everyone  A continental breakfast was included each morning consisting of frenc breada chocolate or plain crossaintorange juice and tea or coffee  The closest metro stop is about a  minute walk and  lines run into that station so its very convenient  The only thing I didnt like is that the tv had no remote but by the time we got back to the room at night we would be asleep a few minutes after turning it on  I will include some room pics too  Any question please email me  
P => Just be warned I wish I would have believed the negative reviews posted on this website  It wasnt the worst hotel ever    you just need to be aware of its shortcomings  I will start off with the positive aspects  The hotel is in a great area if you wanted to stay in the gay area  The hotel staff was very friendly and professional  They were also helpful when we had questions about the area and how to get to attractions in Montreal  The lobby was a little dated but nice  The breakfast in the morning was nice  You have a choice of a regular crossaint or a chocolate crossaint coffee tea or hot chocolate orange juice and a baguette with assorted jellies and peanut butter  Just let them know what time you want it served at  Now for the bad aspects of the hotel  When we arrived they told us to take the elevator to the second floor and then take a quotquick ten stepsquot up to the third floor    so the elevator does not go up all the way  The hallway on the first floor seemed okay    so we were not worried  When we got to the third floor the hallway was a havest gold mustard yellowish neon color  Very ugly  The rooms are the same color  It seemed that the entire third floor is a reated attic why would the elevator not reach that floor  The room itself was small but we expected that  It was fairly clean  The bathroom was clean and nice  Listen up people this was the MOST uncomfortable bed we have EVER slept on or tried to sleep on  It was rock hard and the matress squeeked everytime you moved as to wake up your partner  It was awful  We stayed four nights there and thought about sleeping on the floor instead  The ceiling in the room is one of those tile type ceilings think school classroom  It wouldnt have been so bad if our neighbor did not smoke like a fiend even though they were all non smoking rooms The smoke poured into our room every day until they left  It was awful  While we were in Montreal the weather was quite cold    which we love  The air conditioner didnt look like it even worked    or worked well  When we left we overheard the manager or owner talking about reations planned for the lobby  I certainly hope they also plan on reating that third floor  Also    the pictures on the website are of rooms on the first and second floor  The chairs pictured must have come from the lobby  No such chairs were seen in the rooms  Forget about the flower arrangement  Again it wasnt the worst hotel ever    just be warned that you get what you pay for  
P => Best for the Money On a recent trip to Montreal Canada we stayed at the Hotel St  Andre  We found the price well worth it for the location amenitiesWhere else for the price can you get breakfest brought to your room friendly and helpful staff and clean and secure location  We will certainly recommend the St  Andre to our friends and we will stay there when we return to Montreal  
P => Great place for the money I stayed in the place in tember  and was very happy with overall For the money you cannot go wrong  If you want to stay in the gay village and I did it is close to it and yet walking distance to Old Montreal  I did get the free parking and the breakfast was OK  Think about how many other hotels do not include breakfast      It was nice having the breakfast delivered to your room  One tip regarding breakfast you have to request your next days time of delivery each day  I did not know this and was waiting for my breakfast to be delivered and I had to call the front desk only to be informed that you must request the time of delivery each day The place is very clean and updated  I would rank it a solid  star  I had never stayed in anything less than a  star and normally stay in  or  star but considering what I paid and the location I was very satisfied and would stay again Oh I did not see any strange people in the area If you do not want to see gays then dont go to Montreal    
P => A hotel never to be forgotten     Where should I start    We checked in and out in  day  In the course of  day the following things happenedThe elevator only goes up  flights you have to walk up to the third floorThere was no remote for the TV we did receive a taped up one after  hourThe little refrigerator in the room never really got coldThe hotel is located down an alley in the gay red light districtThe area is in the heart of the gay districtThere are many bums and people panhandling and sleeping in the street about  block from the hotelThere is no sense of security the doors have small slam locks the keys are not computerized they are on large tabs like you are in a bath houseThe bathroom have large waterbugsThe evening front desk person was no help in assisting usThe breakfast is bread tea and juiceThis is not a place to stay with a wife or children The rooms on the third floor seem to be converted from an attic I never cht on after the taxi driver told me hope I have good luck  Do not stay at this hotel         I repeat do not stay there 
P => Not for Internet users This hotel is fine for those who wan to be in the heart of the gay scene in Montreal  The rooms are very simple and the staff is very helpful  The beds are fine as long as you dont move since they make alot of noiceFor those who need Internet access for their laptop then they might want to check other options  They charge for each connection min min  Connection is bad in some rooms  Be prepared to enter the long username and password every  minutes and need to reconnect to websites  
P => Great Budget Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at the St Andre for  nights in   and were extremely pleased with the hotel  It is a budget hotel with the limited services that implies but for the price it was a great deal  The staff were all pleasant friendly and helpful  The room was small and the view wasnt great but it was clean and well maintained  The window opens allowing fresh air  The water pressure in the shower was less than I wouldve liked but not a problem  The hotel provides a complimentary continental breakfast every morning which is brought to the room   the coffee was good and the warm croissants were delicious The hotel has an excellent location just half a block south of St  Catherines St the main commercial strip through downtown Montreal  It is within walking distance from Old Montreal and the Old Port St  Denis St and the shopping district and it is right inside the Village  The area is somewhat gritty plenty of panhandlers and one morning we watched one fellow relieve himself in the alley beside the hotel but appears to be a pretty safe one at the same time  We really enjoyed the hotel  We love Montreal and would definitely consider staying at the St  Andre on a return visit  
P => You want to do business here  Stay here I stayed in St  Andres wonderful Hotel il    I was compelled to write them a thank you letter  I want to the manager  Roger and his staff for all of your hospitality and professionalism you showed me and my friends during our three day stay in your hotel  I know it was no easy task in accommodating a party of  people but your staff did an amazing job  I surprised and the lavish rooms and delicious breakfast delivered every morning at a most economical price  I will recommend your hotel to all of my friends and family and look forward to visiting you in the future  
P => A great place to stay The hotel is in a great location  It is on a small quite street  It is only a five minute walk to the main metro station  In addtion there are many restaurants and shops near by  It is an older hotel that is well taken care of  The staff is pleasant and very helpful  I was there in ch

P => Cheap centrally located clean   what more could you ask for First the one negative its surrounded by strip clubs and sex shops so if you have kids or are easily offended dont stay hereNow the outrageous number of positives if you book ahead with the web deal its insanely cheap compared to anything else  Its located walking distance to a huge number of tourist attractions and its   block from the Metro station if you need to go further  The staff have been very friendly and finding out it was our first trip to Montreal have made sure we knew about all the places we should go see  Parking is right around the corner in a guarded lot and only costs  CAD a day  The rooms are lived in but clean with a sink and towel racks in the room itself  The bathrooms are huge and clean and well lit  The heat works very well  There is free Wi Fi with a strong signal It is an area that gets a little rowdy at night so sleeping with the windows open is definitely out but each room has an AC in the window Oh and bring your own alarm clock   that isnt provided  All the other usual stuff is I would definitely stay here again if coming to this area  
P => Dont You Just Love A Bargain First let me say I am used to traveling alone and all over the world  I am a young  year old female business owner that is in shape  Youll understand shortly why this info is important I found this hotel on the Web  I shop first location then for price when looking for a hotel  I dont like spending a lot of money on a hotel room because you only sleep and shower there at least thats all I usually do This place was less than half the price than the other hotels  And in my opinion well worth it I did read the other reviews on TripAdvisor and I want to address both the bad and good that other people had to say  Its always intersting that people can have such conflicting opinions but be in the exact same place  Some times even at the same timeI wanted a hotel that was close to everything so I could walk  This hotel is centrally located it is about a     minute walk to Old Montreal  minute walk to the Quarter LatinChinatown and   walk the other direction to all the shopping  OMGoddess is there SHOPPING it is dizzying For what I wanted to do on this first trip to Montreal this hotel was perfectly located Now   just where it is located right on St Catherine and yes people there is a sex shop next door I took a picture for you to see  And an Opera across the street  And Plaza de la Arts on the next block  If that is going to freak you out then stay someplace else  Yes people brought children into the hotel  We all lived  The reception desk is on the second floor  You do have to go up two flights of stairs to get into the hotel  You will have to go up two or three flights of stairs to get to your room  This was not a big deal to me as I exercise for a living  To many people it would be a big deal to not have an elevator  I suggest you start a regular exercise program   then youd have no issues with a few stairs The room was clean  I did a shared bathroom which was clean as well  And so was the bathroom below which I used if someone was in the one next to my room  I would stay here again if I came to Montreal  The staff was very nice and friendly  And no the place was NOT A BROTHEL  If it was I certainly didnt notice  And it certainly didnt affect effect me if it was  If you want a fancy hotel with an elevator a spacious room with expensive linens lotions and potions and fancy soaps etc  this is NOT it  But you arent paying for that either  So please dont complain if that isnt what you get  HELLOParking was not available on site  There is a  outside lot you can park in  I have a BMW so I chose to park in the Plaza De Arts secure underground lot for  a day located   blocks away  Note you cannot get into this parking area on Sundays to park but you can get out CASH ONLY You can unload your luggage in front of the hotel then go park your car Be sure to eat at Boccacinos on McGill College   awesome food both breakfast lunch and dinner  And right next door is Les  Brausseurs spelling great beer and great food Old Montreal is really beautiful  I enjoyed the shopping on rue St Paul much more than all of the k stores in many of the underground areas  Sitting in the park is quite pleasant  I cant tell you about nightlife because I have been there done that  years ago and Im not interested in doing it again Montreal is an extremely easy city to navigate  I used a map  No problems what so ever  You can get this map at this hotel I hope folks find this review helpful  Happy travels 
P => Everything alright Nice place right in the center of the city  Its a great place since it is located right at the main road you go for shopping or dining  Even night entertainment is all around  Rooms are ok nothing fancy everything is rather old but everything is clean bathrooms are recently reated  So it is nothing special but for that price everything is alright  
P => Best budget location We stayed here during the Grand Prix and you cant beat the location for the price  Metro and bus on the block or walk to the downtown shopping Chinatown trendy restaurants up St Laurent or Vieux Port If all you need is a place to rest your head at night because youll spend the whole day touring the city this hotel cannot be beat  
P => Clean Budget Hotel very conveniently located I have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions whenever I visit Montreal    The convenience of its location for the price is astounding No matter your interests   museums art galleries cultural performances shopping festivals old Montreal Chinatown   all are withing walking distance As well everything that is not within walking distance is conveniently accessed through the Metro located across the street from the hotel so you can easily find your way to the Bioderm the Casino numerous parcs etc   The rooms of the hotel itself are quaint historically orated keeping with the European theme of an Inn  The bathrooms are shared but cleanliness is outstanding  The studio rooms are quiet each has its own kitchenette and bathroom facility and are quite roomy     The airconditioning gives comfort even in the hottest monthsAnd the review would not be complete if I would not mention the front desk service   always willing to accommodate your needs towels extra pillow etc    as well as giving you information about the best attractions and places to eat and directions as to how to get there  They even offer to make your reservations for you or call for a taxiYes there are nightclubs street dwellers and prostitutes around just like in any big city center but you can feel safe walking alone even at night because you will also see the tourists as well as the locals with their families enjoying the night life the restaurants the festivals    and you can feel assured that once youve entered the hotel you truly are home 
P => It is a brothel We received a recommendation from a friend who said it was a good hotel for the price  The rooms and bathrooms are clean and the service is nice  Everybody is very attentive and polite  Unfortunately those are the only good things in this place  The location is close to a lot of Montreal top ten places to visit but its a very weird neighborhood with lots of protitution and drugs  Like other users said my husband also saw lots of protitutes going up and down to the rooms  We had to stay in the first floor and it is very noisy the hole night we could hear people talking loud music cars and I dont know what else  It was two very terrible nights and nobody could sleep properly  It was really not worth it 
P => Great for an overnight getaway on a budget Visiting friends in Vermont   We drove up for an overnight stay and grabbed the last room available here  My friends had stayed there before  The  of us shared one of the quotsuitesquot that have small kitchenettes included  For our purposes the hotel was great   within walking distance to everything we did   dinner drinks clubs etc    Was great for a quick getaway on a budget  We certainly had no grand expectations but the service was friendly and the room was comfortable  Did not notice any loud neighbors and our room did not overlook a street  The window ac unit was great white noise  
P => It is actually a brothel At first I thought it was a great price for a hotel   Ok lets try it   but I when I walked in the front entrance I saw two prostitutes walking down the stairs  I promptly walked out    I continuously saw prostitutes walking in and out and hanging around the entrance to that hotel  If you dont believe me just pass by there around  a m  every morning  
P => A home away from home I have stayed at the Abri du Voyageur every summer for the past  years  I have travelled the world and have stayed in low budget to five star rated hotels  All I can say is that I have consistently been thoroughly impressed with this fine boutique hotel  What I have enjoyed about the hotel is the European feel it has   reminiscent of stays that I have had in Paris and Rome with shared bathrooms on every floor  Yes the bathrooms are shared but I have never once felt that they were unsanitary or lacked quothot waterquot etc  I find that this hotel is fantastic for people of all ages and backgrounds and since many European travellers stay here it is a fantastic opportunity to meet new people from all over the world The staff at the Abri du Voyageur hotel are fantastic  from the front desk staff Carole Nicolas and Diane in particular to the cleaning staff Sylvie Veronica etc  As you can see the staff put in the extra effort to make you feel like the Abri du Voyageur is a home away from home  so much so that they consistently remember my name when I walk in the door ask what I was doing during the day and make suggestions of daily and evening activities Yes the Abri du Voyageur is located in an area that historically has been rated as a quotred light districtquot  but the area is changing drastically  Ive actually enjoyed staying here because this area has been extensively written about by famous Quebec playwrite Michel Tremblay as quotLa Mainquot   this is a very historical area  With the changes in the area this hotel is located right in the middle of the entertainment district  The last time I stayed here I ided to stay in one of the studio apartments  How lucky was I to be able to walk out of the building and right into the middle of Les Francofolies a French Canadian musical festival   right outside the doorI really dont understand peoples lower ratings of this hotel  As I have said before this hotel has a very European feel about it  and it is inexpensive  Really I cant understand when people have five star expectations for a lower budget hotel In all as I have said I truly feel that the Abri du Voyageur hotel is a wonderful place to stay in Montreal   it is in an amazing location   right in the middle of everything  If you are willing to be open minded and open to having an fantastic time then this hotel is for you Give it a try 
P => Unusual but pleasant L Abri du Voyageur is a funny place in downtown Montreal where to spend few days if you want to visit this town being based in a very lively place The hotel is placed in the quothotquot quarter of sex shops and nightclubs but donbe neither scared nor impressed Its bland indeed theres no risk and the area is quite safe  When I chose this hotel I felt confident in what reported on the Lonely Planet guide and must confess that description of this place is really truthful  My husband and our two kids  amp  years old rent one of the quotstudiosquot of the Abri du Voyageur since we preferred to have a private bathroom Hotel rooms have shared services  Despite the access to the studios can appear a bit disquietinglocated in a more desert road at the rear of the Hotel we were positively surprised by our little apartment basic but spacious and clean big bathroom and a very useful kitchenette that we used for breakfast and dinner   There was also an air conditioner a bit noisy but necessary during those hot days in Montreal  The lady at the front desk was very nice  friendly and helpful taking care to inform us about all attractions activities and Jazz festival in those days   The kids were so delighted when she offered them two beautiful pens as welcome present of the Hotel for its guestsOverall I can say that if you are looking for tranquility far from noise luxury amp comfort or any sort of amenities dont choose lAbri du Voyageur  but if you are looking for a simple and funny place in a lively and nicely chaotic area in the heart of the town at cheap rates  absolutely go to lAbri du Voyageur 
P => It aint the Ritz but a good budget option I was a bit nervous about this place after reading the negative reviews on TripAdvisor but my stay was totally fine  I booked this hotel for my mother and myself after finding it in Lonely Planet and checking out its website  We were looking to save a little money but still be well located within the city so we thought wed go Euro style and book a room with a shared bathroom  It was  a night for a room with  double beds   and this was during Jazz Fest  So all seemed well and we were set for three nights  The good  for two people in a downtown hotel is not too shabby even considering the shared bathroom  The location was right in the middle of Jazz Fest super close to the Place des Arts half a block from the metro and about a  minute walk to Chinatown and Vieux Montreal  Parking in a secure lot around the corner was  a day excellent for a city  The bathrooms were clean and relatively private if a bit small  Our room was large with  foot high stamped tin ceilings vintage moldings and huge windows on two sides  The staff were on duty  hours and were always incredibly friendly and helpful and fluent in English  Theres a convenience store just around the corner which is handy if you want to grab a water or something The bad Our air conditioner was CRAZY loud  It would cycle on and off continually which was distracting at night and when it would suddenly cycle on it was kind of startling  And a little hard to hear someone across the room  It did keep the room perfectly cool during some hot muggy days and we never did ask to change rooms or have it looked at so I guess it wasnt the biggest deal ever but it was probably the worst thing about our stay The reality The hotel is in the quotred light districtquot of Montreal     which is pretty tame  Yes there is a sex shop next door and there  be a transient sitting on the steps from time to time  If thats something you cannot deal with this hotel is not for you  If you want something clean safe affordable and well located this is a fine option  
P => perfect for travellers on budget  perfect downtown location i stay here everytime i visit montreal  the standard rooms are not the best if ur looking for quality bubecause of shared bathroom but its private once u get inside  if youre looking for more upscale you can try the studios in the same motel for more money but theyre much much better  you get private washroom and kitchenette and room is much cleaner and newer looking  perfect location right in downtown great helpful staff and couldnt ask for more  i tried other low budget motels in mtl and this one is the best value for your dollar  feel free to contact me further for details  
P => Not quite the Hilton We stayed here on a recommendation from other travellers but we think they were confused about the location The place is cheap and clean enough but not really much for relaxing in  Its in a red light area that during the day is OK but less inviting at night  I did not really feel safe in the hotel fire trap and re enforced doors make you wonder about prior events and that you should hatch an escape plan but all worked out OK  Oh the hole in the wall above the bed was a nice touch The staff were friendly and helpful and its in walking distance to attractions  I wouldnt stay here again but if you want cheap wont spend much time in your room and not too worried about the rowdy night life outside the window then be it would be OK  Otherwise Dont stay here 
P => Excellent Budget Hotel This is an excellent budget hotel  The rooms and common areas were spacious clean  comfortable and well maintained  The shared bathrooms were also spacious and clean  Staff were friendly and helpful  The hotel is on the intersection of two major roads   one takes you to downtown shopping areas and theatres  The other takes you to Chinatown the old town and the Mount Royal district  Bedroom windows have double glazing so the noise wasnt a problem  Most of the tourist attractions are within walking distance  The hotel is in a small strip club area but I a female wasnt harassed and I felt safe all the time  There is very good securtiy at the hotel   someone is onsite h a day the front door was locked and the rooms had ent locks  Some of the floors are on a slight slope and there is no elevator so if you have mobility problems you might find it easier to pay a bit extra and stay elsewhere  I enjoyed my stay here and woud defintely stay again when I return to Montreal  
P => Appalling   would never go back I cannot understand how this hotel has ever had a positive review   some of the rooms must be better than the one I stayed in My room faced out onto the street and because this is not a nice area it really isnt there were frequent noisy fights outside during the night  The second night this erupted into some pretty serious violence The room itself would have been quite good spacious and reasonably orated but the floor of the room was on a serious slant   so much so that I got a sore hip from my bed being on an angle This is pretty reflective of the overall standard of the building which also seemed to have dodgy floorboards and stairs The communal shower in the hall didnt have hot water  On the second night the electricity to the building disappeared in the middle of the night and still hadnt come back on by the next morning this appeared to be specific to the building because the rest of the street looked fine The one good thing was that the staff were helpful and friendly and when I asked to leave on the second day of my ten day stay they refunded my money without question  I would never go back though  I suggest that if people can afford to spend slightly more they go the the Hostelling International place in the city centre which is a great place and where I enjoyed the rest of my stay 
P => Not worth it I stayed at LAbri Voyageur for three nights in emberember  and dont plan on making that mistake again First the good my third floor room was spacious and clean  The hotel staff were very nice  The hotel is in a terrible area but is walking distance away from most of Montreals main sites Old Montreal the port Chinatown the Palais de Congres etc The bad The neighbourhood is dangerous  Homeless people congregated on the steps of the hotel all the time and I had to step around them to get in  There are two nightclubs very close to the hotel and the noise kept me up all night  The walls are very thin and I could hear everyone walking by and the person in the next room opening and closing his drawers watching TV my set didnt work because the reception was terrible and talking on his cell phone  The bathrooms were gungy  Theres two per floor Theres no elevator so thats something to take into consideration if you want to stay here and I also advise you to bring your own alarm clock if you want to be woken up on time  The hotel doesnt provide it  
P => Quite an adventure Visited in  single male traveler and have to say that this really is a great bargain  I stayed in the suites section and had a large bedroom kitchenette with all appliances and conveniences   for those who want to shop and eat in occasionally private bathroom and plenty of space  Portable air conditioner TV included no telephone and no internet capability in room   some kind of intercom was on wall but didnt have to use  Room was very clean and quiet for the most part  Not straightened up one day during my  day stay  Finding hotel was easy once you understand all the one ways and maneuver the traffic which is menacing  Arrival was hurried as parking in front of hotel is limited then you walk up flight of stairs and quickly check in  Suites are around the coroner and parking private but very inexpensive is a block behind  Once you get parked you have to bring luggage back to the suites roadwork going on and confusing entrance  I had a room on the rd floor and the climb was daunting  If you are elderly or have problems getting around this is not the ideal setup for you  Parking was okay on weekends however weekday parking filled quickly with people who worked in the area  Sometimes have to leave key and have attendant park when space opens up  Not a big deal though  Conveniently located in quotcenterquot of town within walking distance to China Town Old Town and most quottouristquot sites  Walking distance to all kinds of restaurants and major malls nearby  Yes the area does look kinda seedy but I felt pretty safe and I wandered about all hours of day and night  Rental car came in handy because I wanted to visit Quebec otherwise the metro system and buses are everywhere  
P => Hotel With Personality Hotel is within easy walking distance of the convention centre and wonderful specialty shops  The rooms are clean and the staff are friendly and helpful  The rates are very reasonable The hotel has personality  The room I stayed in had hard wood floors an original oil painting and an old bank vault for a clothes closet The neighborhood has tatoo shops and sex shops but felt very safe and I was out until around mid night fairly often  The odd night there was some noise when the bars let out but that did not keep me awake  People concerned about night noise can ask for a room away from the street I would give his hotel serious consideration if I was going to Montreal again  The hotel is one of the few travel bargains available  
P => Not what you expect First the location Next to a tatoopiercing place accross from a romantic shop and a street off several sex shop It is however a block or so from the Desjardin complex which is nice and convenient Second the room  We ided to go for the reated studios with private bath  Those are not in the same building that the main hotel but off a side street  There are  of them  The studios are nice and clean  The sound proofing is terrible so your stay will depend on the other customers  We stayed four long nights there We had paid in advance   big mistake  The first two nights we didnt sleep Third there are not elevators The steps are very steep and made of metal  Finaly the safety in that building is lacking If I can advise you check out the Hyatt regency hotel in the desjardins complex their room were only  more and so much better 
P => This place is great Dont believe the bad reviews Ill start with a disclaimer   this hotel is probably not that well suited if youre travelling with children but otherwise its great  We stayed at the studio apartments so i dont know how the other rooms are but the studio is great  The reason this hotel is so cheap is that there IS a sex shop right nearby but this in no way should deter you from staying there  The area is safe its a   minute walk from the Old Port area a  minute walk from downtown and barely a  minute subway ride to the Montreal Casino  The subway is literally up the block less than a minute walk The studios are great and include a fully equipped kitchen  Our studio was very clean  The only downside was that there was no phone so bring your cell phone Overall i greatly enjoyed it so dont believe the bad reviews about the quotareaquot that its in  The location is incredibly convenient to pretty much anything youd want to see in Montreal  
P => Abri du voyageur  Nice and Clean Price and location are this hotels main selling points but it also manages to squeeze in some unassuming charm high ceilings bare brick walls original pine and maple floors and paintings by local artists  Excellent value for my little budget  
P => really liked it Stayed here for  nights in a single room wshared bathroom  As they advertise I found the place really clean  Was surprised to find well kept hardwood floors in the guest room  Air conditioning worked well too but didnt need it much    TV didnt tune much in though but no big deal The shared bathroom is one where you walk in and lock the door and have all to yourself    its not the several showers and sinks in a row like you might find at the ymca or a youth hostel  Quite nice Staff was great too  No problems here  Great budget choice suited my needs just fine  Would consider returning 
P => Great Location Great Deal Just returned from having stayed a couple of nights at LAbri du Voyageur and would highly recommend it  We stayed in one of their studio apartments  Its located around the corner from the main establishment  The room was clean and comfortable and you cant beat the price  a night that includes the taxes for an apartment with kitchenette and private bath Yes the neighborhood is a bit of a red light district but as a woman in her s I never once felt uncomfortable  One of the universities is nearby UQAM so there are many students around  The Metro stop is less than a block away  Chinatown and Old Montreal are an easy walk  Great location Great deal 
P => great location great staff convenient clean safe  Upon reading the other reviews here I was a bit nervous about staying at this hotel  Budget was my main concern and I ided to go ahead and risk it    Im so glad that I did  For  USD  night this hotel is the best value Ive ever come across  The bed was very comfortable the room was clean and air conditioned and while the bathrooms were shared it was possible to lock yourself in    no gang showers or anything like that  The other thing this hotel has going for it is location location location  It is right in the heart of Montreal walking distance to everything centered at the cross roads of downtown chinatown old town le plateau St  Dennis cheap parking is close as is the metro green line  Yes the hotel is in the quotred light districtquot but this is a very different thing than a similar neighborhood would be in the united states  I was traveling with my girlfriend and at no point did we feel offended or unsafe  The extent of the district is about a block and a half    very small  Probably not the best location for a catholic family vacation but for singles or couples not offended by the presence of strip clubs this is a great stay  I liked this place so much that Id stay there again even if I had a bigger budget in the future   
P => Wonderful hotel Im somewhat surprised at some of the reviews of this hotel  I found the room to be comfortable and affordable  The varied residence added a great deal of flavor to my stay  The whole hotel has a great Old World feel to it and the rooms and bathrooms were all very clean  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful offering numerous suggestions on good pubs and restaurants in the area  All in all a wonderful experience  In these days of cookie cutter chain hotels it is a great pleasure to find a hotel that actually possesses some character  
P => Get what you pay for Ive read other reviews about this place complaining about the hookers in the lobby and the activities you can hear going on at night  If you are looking for something a bit classy you have to pay more than  a night The hotel is surrounded by sex shops cinemas and shops and they DO rent out the rooms by the hour  But we never felt unsafe or offended The staff were courteous and the room was clean and serviced every day  The bathrooms are shared but they too are clean and the shower is good The location is perfect for everything   downtown old town china town and all restaurants  If you want a dirt cheap price for a private room rather than a hostel dormitory this is great  
P => Awesome Studios The Studios are awesome clean and have a really nice little kitchenette with everything you need to cook  There are even washing machines and dryers in the bathroom with detergent and even fabric softner sheets  It was  canadian with taxes which was like  for me  It is on a scary looking street but after looking around I realized it has to been one of the greatest hidden locations in Montreal  Station Saint Laurent The Metro is about  minutes away and the Quartier Latin Latin Quarter is only  minutes way  The Desjardins Complex is like a mall and has an awesome super ket which is also about  minutes at the most away from the HotelStay here you wont regret it 
P => For the budget excellent clean stay For the budget excellent clean stay 
P => Fid le   sa r putation  
P => Contrairement   quon dit  
P => Terrific location comfy rooms nice staff We stayed for three nights at the Omni Mont Royal and were impressed by the value the location and the extremely comfortable room with a great view  You can walk to the Metro shopping dining and to McGIll University which is nearby  It was a special quotstay three nights pay for twoquot rate and was quite inexpensive when averaged out  Quiet large room very comfy beds great bathroom pleasant staff  Low key ambience which suited us just fine  
P => Great Location  I stayed at this hotel last ober  The room was spacious and clean with a very nice bathroom  I did not eat or spent much time in the hotel since there were so many things to do around there  I also did not interact much with the hotel Staff but overall it was a very nice experience for my first trip to Montr al  
P => Absolutely no problem with the OMNI Booked the Omni for a one night weekend stay at a very reasonable internet rate  Hotel room was very big and well appointed  or was classic not modern but still nice  We had a great view of McGill and Mont Royal  Noise was not an issue for us Staff was friendly and helpful from the doorman to the front desk staff  Location suited our needs  The big shops on Ste Catherine were within walking distance and there were plenty of taxis available when we wanted to venture further afield  Very serviceable place  Not the greatest I have stayed at but very good indeed  
P => Would Return Soon The Omni Mont Royal is a great hotel  We were there for the weekend and had a great room with a wonderful south view of the city  The bathroom was about the size of rooms at other hotels Would highly recommend this hotel  Great location close to the subway walking distance to all downtown attractions and shopping  Good buffet breakfast too  
P => Friendly and enjoyable The Hotel Omni Mont Royal was fairly priced and clean  They were very friendly at the front desk and the room was nice enough  It is quite old and probably once was very nice but has seen its better days  Beyond that   the staff was courteous and treated us well  I signed up for the member card and they brought us coffee every morning which was a nice touch  The hotel is not a bad walk to St Catherine street and Crecent Street either  The price was right through travelocity when booked with a good buy discount  Overall we had a good stay  
P => Totally worth the money I have stayed here twice  Both time the staff has been extremely friendly the concierge was very helpful when making reservations  The rooms are VERY large and comfortable with plenty of seating and workspace  The bathrooms are incredible as well  
P => Great location good rooms Check in was fast room is clean  Close to most things including the subway overall very convenient  Also free internet in the room so you can stay in and Google Montreal if the weather is too bad  Parking in the downtown area is tight we paid around hrs for hotel parking  Will stay here again  
P => Staff  Great deal through TravelZoo  The Hotel is in an ideal location  The rooms are clean beds are comfortable  The Opus restaurant amp bar is excellent but what made the stay a great one was each and every staff member we encountered was friendly helpful and considerate in both languages  We look forward to going again  
P => Loved hotel great location Stayed at hotel for three days as part of road trip between LA and NYC seeing friends in Montreal  On the main street in downtown Montreal  Superb location  Used valet service when I arrive which was very efficent and easy to use  no problems with it whatsoever  I had a palour room on th floor  I was huge  Very clean and large  Although I only had a sofa bed it was very comfortable and as I had a great price for such a room it was no problem  I had a super view over mount royale  US and Canadian TV channels  Conceirge was very helpful  Walking distance to all the sights  Nearby Rue Crescent for plenty of bars and restaurants  I would definately stay there again when I go back to Montreal  Great stay  
P => Excellent service location and value Great service and location The doorman concierge and front desk were all extremely friendly and helpful throughout our weekend stay  Rooms are very spacious including one of the largest beds Ive ever slept in plus a nice sized bathroom as well  While the furniture and or are a little outdated lots of pink grandmash drapes and furniture it was very comfortable and clean  Overall a GREAT value 
P => Excellent value perfect location Truly excellent for the price though I didnt choose the hotel as a Priceline bidder it chose me  Built with quality as a Four Seasons it has spacious rooms ble baths and has been reasonably updated  The location across from McGill and within easy distance of all downtown attractions cant be beat  The lobby bar which doubles as a breakfast room wasnt great  However the lobby itself retains some of the elegance of the original property and there was little to criticize about the room  Well furnished huge ent towels bathrobe good bed  Honestly from some of the mixed reviews in this forum I was pleasantly surprised and would stay here again  
P => Always a favorite We have stayed at this Omni many times over the past few years   and have two reservations upcoming  amp   We stay exclusively at the Omni while in Montreal  The hotel is absolutely perfect from check in through check out  The rooms are elegant spacious comfortable and clean  The bathrooms are spotless with good water pressure  The staff are always friendly and accommodating The workout room has plenty of pieces of equipment   including treadmills ellipticals rower and bikes as well as weight equipment  The equipment has always been in good repair  There is a arate room for floor exercisesyoga with balls  The outdoor pool is comfortable even in winter  We have used the outdoor pool accessed from indoors in below  degree temps with snow falling   and the water is still warm  The outdoor mini lights   with snow falling   is beautiful There is a co ed sauna as well as steam rooms in both the mens and womens chaning rooms  The changing rooms also have showers and lockers We have never eaten in the restaurant   but have enjoyed drinks in the bar adjacent to the lobby There is a charge for parking   but we have always been able to go a few blocks away and park on the street without a problem The location is perfect   near St  Catherine St Museum of Fine Arts   great restaurants shopping etc  The subway is also nearby  
P => Great location excellent room reasonable price I joined my wife who was in town on business at the Montreal Omni for a night during ober   The hotel was clean the bed comfortable the room relatively spacious the Internet free and the location excellent for shopping business and dining out We had stayed at the Ritz Carlton down the street a couple of years earlier and we both agreed that the Omni was a standout better hotel both in terms of amenities and price Breakfast which was not included in our price was served in a rather small room but they still managed to offer a buffet with a good selection and reasonably responsive service  Curiously there was no problem getting a seat  
P => Very pleasantly surprised I booked an apollo room at The Omni which meant a room with a pull down bed and therefore a cheaper rate  I was full of trepidation when I arrived but in fact the room was great  It was very spacious with a double sofa bed dining table TV and cupboard sideboard erate mini bar huge wardrobe and lovely bathroom  The or was traditional rather than modern  The bed was a sofa bed so wasnt the most comfortable in the world but for three nights it was absolutely fine   and the staff made it up every day so there no work involved in converting it from a sofa every night Location was brilliant    mins from the metro and  mins from the centre of the shopping district  A slightly longer walk to Old Montreal  I was on the th floor and there was a great view of the park from there The service was good although I didnt use the restaurant  Concerige was amazing   knew everything and could sell me tickets for most things And in case youre wondering its  fixed price for the taxi fare from the ariport  
P => Wonderful stay at this little hotel I stayed here for  nights for a small conference  Although I would agree with other reviewers that the hotel is a bit worn in places overall I had a fabulous stay  Here are the reasons whyRoom Shared a room and requested two beds  Was a bit worried when they said twin beds but unlike places that claim to have two queens and then give you small doubles the twin beds were quite large and a good size for one person  The room was also very large and there were nice amneities like bathrobes etc  I also apprecited the free wifi   not a given in older hotels Fitness center First   unlike many hiltons which nickel and dime you to death the fitness center was free  Several rooms including a yoga room that is available to just use when they are not offering classes also free  This was really helpful   and a contrast to a recent stay in a grand hyatt which didnt allow bare fit thus preventing certain types of fitness activities  Second   great little room to the side with pitchers of water and a small continental breakfast set up in the morning  The water   with nice touches like lemon or cucumber   was available all day  Also nice outdoor pool that one accesses from inside  During my stay plenty of adults were swimming for exercise  Staff very polite and helpful  Public spaces quite nice if a bit cold  But that is alwasy a problem with hotels  
P => I liked it We stayed at the Omni Mont Royal for  nights  We arrived to Montreal late at night pm and called ahead to make sure that our room would still be there when we arrived  The reservation people were very nice and made sure we still had our room We arrived and the doorman let us park our car in the reserved spot while we checked in and brought our luggage up to the room  Check in was fast friendly and easy  We chose to do self park across the street for  per night which I was not too impressed about but its Montreal   what can you expect for parkingThe room looked a bit dated but was still very elegant clean and spacious  We were on the th floor and had a very nice view of Montreal The bed was comfortable  We called front desk the first night to ask for pillows and they never showed up  But on the second night they did   The location was great  We were able to walk everywhere including Old Montreal some great restaurants on St Catherine street Chinatown and many other great shopping and walking places  My only complaint was this We asked one of the doormen to recommend a good place to eat on the last night we were there and he told us to go to a steak restaurant on Peel street right besides the hotel for quotgreat sirloin steakquot  The name of the restaurant was quot   st  Jean something or otherquot  They only serve one thing   sirloin steak with fries  The meal was horrible and it cost us  for the both of us  Disgusting food  Please do yourself a favour and dont listen to the doorman 
P => A Mixed Experience at the Omni This is a hard review to write    We stayed at the Omni for three nights in mid ust having booked through Priceline at a very good rate  per night  The hotel made a terrible first impression upon our arrival but gradually over the course of our three night stay it seemed to grow on us a bit  It seems to be struggling to establish an identity in an increasingly crowded downtown hotel ket The cab driver we engaged after arriving at the VIA station needed us to give him directions to the hotel  We didnt take that as a good sign   Upon entering the hotel we were greeted with chaos  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon around pm and since check in was not until pm did not expect our room to be ready especially given that our reservation was through Priceline  It wasnt but we were told it would be in about   minutes so we ided to wait in the small and very crowded lobby  The hotel was host to a rather motley crew of guests that day  an Arthur Murray dance competition in flamboyant costumes a couple of American convention groups and a number of travelling vagabonds whose luggage consisted of knapsacks and duffle bags  This seemed at odds with the elegant upscale or of the lobby including fresh floral arrangements and expensive goods on offer in the display cases and the attempted professionalism of the uniformed staff  In fact on our second night there we had to call down to security to request they try to quiet down a rather noisy room of partiers across the hall from us  more the kind of crowd you would expect at a Howard Johnsons or Motel  than an Omni We were kept waiting almost TWO hours  After being told to wait   minutes that was unacceptable  We were offered a coupon for two free drinks at their lounge a sad joke of a place really for what purports to be a  star hotel but we didnt use it Our room was on the th floor overlooking the outdoor pool and adjacent office buildings  It was surprisingly bright because it was a corner unit spacious and well furnished  The bathroom was very large and there were robes and an umbrella in the closet  Sure the upholstery and draperies are about  years or more out of fashion but they were clean and in good repair  Things were looking upThe hotel is in a convenient location for high end shopping and good restaurants  Unfortunately it is not connected to the underground city so I would not stay here in the winter  We made use of the fitness centre each day large ent equipment lots of windows  Each morning there was a small continental breakfast set up in one of the adjoining rooms coffee juice pastries fresh fruit  We would just grab some bananas and apples after our workout before heading to the Pain Dore down the street for breakfast  The pool looked alright but it was always so crammed full of children and oversized quotfloatersquot cant really call them swimmers they just bobbed in place we didnt use it once We had mixed encounters with the staff  The front desk clerks were always friendly and professional  The concierges were hit or miss  The younger ones were sulky and unhelpful the older ones were more polished and professional Overall Im still at odds over how to rate this hotel  It seems about   years past its prime but it has potential  I would probably stay here again for the rate we paid  Otherwise next time we visit Montreal we will most likely stay at one of the boutique hotels in Vieux Montreal or at the Queen Elizabeth attached to the VIA Rail station  
P => Glad We Switched We planned to be in Montreal starting   then leave for Quebec City   then come back to a final night in Montreal   before our early flight home    We had originally booked at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth but switched to Omni due to the strike at the Fairmont  For a much lower price we got a great large room with a view  As Omni Select members there is no charge for in room internet and a morning beverage is complimentary  Very clean nice rooms good service  We thought for the final night in Montreal before the flight home we would keep the reservation at the Fairmont  The strike was still in full force  The non striking hotel workers were doing their very best but I wouldnt stay there for more than one night while the strike was continuing  Weve stayed at Omni properties in New Orleans and Orlando and had positive experiences each time  
P => Stayed for a few days  I was there between the end of  and beginning of t  I booked a room for a few days and didnt have any problems with the service  The room was cleaned well and was able to sleep with no noise until I left in the mornings around   I dont know about the pool etc   I didnt use them  Staff were friendly too  
P => Beautiful hotel great rooms I had a wonderful room with a comfortable bed and very clean bathroom  I was exceptionally pleased with the space I had  The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was good  The facilities were excellent The location is very good too and just a short walk from the main areas of Montreal for shopping eating getting coach tours etc  McGill University is nearby and has a lovely campus to visit  
P => Outstanding location and service at the Omni  My family recently had a pleasant stay at the Omni Mont Royal and I was extremely impressed by the high level of service we received from the concierge front desk and valet  I also brought my cocker spaniel with me and was required to pay a  fee which is quite common now with leading hotels to cover additional room cleaning  They were also nice enough to provide me a bag of dog toys and treats as well as some toys and activities for my niece who was also with us The room is good but not nearly as nice as the Omni in Davenport which I stayed at last year  Otherwise I would have rated the hotel  stars and not four  The beds were very comfortable and we also enjoyed using the outdoor pool facility The location is fantastic as it is close to McGill University shopping restaurants and entertainment  I would stay here again in the future 
P => Great stay at the Omni For a recent family vacation with our two children we booked our room on Priceline knowing that there was a chance we might not get a room with two beds  Upon check in we found this to be the case but they had booked us in a large king room that would accommodate two rollaway beds for no additional charge  We were pleased to find our room on the th floor had a fantastic view of Mont Royal McGill Campus and the Olympic Stadium  The bathroom was large with bidet full tub fluffy large towels blow dryer magnifying mirror and very nice quality soapsshampooconditionerlotion  King bed was very comfortable and I especially loved the big feather pillows  There was ample floor space for the two top quality rollaways We joined the Omni Select Guest program prior to the trip which gave us complementary hot and cold beverages delivered each morning of our stay  The fitness facility was very well equipped with arate rooms for weight machines cardio and daily fitness classes  Workout wear is provided  There is a sauna and a lovely outdoor pool with a tunnel leading to the indoor hot tub  We found everything to be clean and orderly during our stay and the kids thoroughly enjoyed the pool The concierge staff was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and metro directions  We chose not to dine in the hotel since the neighborhood has so many restaurants to choose from  The downtown location was a great base for our many outings  One block from a metro station a few blocks from the base of Mont Royal about three blocks from the Museum of Fine Arts about a twenty minute walk to Old Montreal  Overall we found the hotel to be in great shape clean and well run with a lovely or  
P => Excellent choice My husband and I booked one night at the Omni Mont Royal through Priceline com  We did the quotname your pricequot option and for  we were spoiled It exceed our expecations  The room was massive king size bed robes great view The lobby is beautiful service is great and I can I say this the entire hotel just smells really goodThe location is ideal two blocks from St Catherine  I would have gladly paid the full rate for this hotel but getting the deal through priceline made it even sweeter  Highly recommended  
P => great location We had a great stay here at the Omni  Our room was very nice and the service was excellent  The concierge was so helpful in making suggestions on getting around via metro  We did not use the hotel for breakfast but there are so many good restaurants in the area and the hotel is close to the Subway stations and great shopping We would definitely stay here again  
P => Great View of Mt  Royal If youre looking for a dazzling lobby go to the Ritz down the street but this is the best Omni Ive ever stayed  Had a room on one of the upper floors with a fantastic view of Mt  Royal the little quotmountainquot in the middle of Montreal  Took a walk daily up Peel street you need to me in shape to the magnificent park on the hill  It was designed by the same guy that did Central Park in NYC  Our room was spacious and the pool and fitness areas were very nice  Never ate at their restaurant since there are so many others within walking distance  You are a block away from the subway and underground  Great city very nice hotel and the staff was of the highest quality  
P =>  nights of bliss    This was a beautiful hotel with clean spacious rooms  Located in the Museum district this hotel is very close to the famous Rue St  Catherine   lots of shopping and food The hotel staff are very courteous and friendly  We asked for extra towels as we used ours for the swimming pool and they came to our room within minutes Parking is day underground across the street or  or so at the hotel internet use is  per half hour  There is a swimming pool a sauna and a hot tub that they clean every Sunday night about an hour before closing but unfortunately they didnt tell us that so just when we needed to relax in the hot tub it was closed  There is an exercise facility that is open  and they even have classes that are tht by an instructor Whats great is that they have a mini bar that you can restock as there are no seals or tape on the beverages   its a plus if you really need something and you dont have to feel guilty about paying  for a bottle of beer We didnt do this but you could All in all a lovely place and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone 
P => Always Perrfect My expectations were met yet again  The hotel is exceptional  I guess the other reviewers had different rooms  We stayed here from e  y   My room was a delux not a ior suit as before  A huge king size bed big bathroom with thick plush towels and all the usual amenities  The location is excellent for downtown shopping and mont royal walking  the rice was higher than the other hotel I would stay at  days later but it was worth every penny  I was given a   off coupon for the Spa  The wait at check in and out was too long   But the accomodations was priceless  Our room overlooked sherbrooke street  We had turndown service with chocolates on our pillows  Yes this hotel spoiles you and will be my first choice for any stay in Montreal  Check out La Belle province for Breakfast and the peel pub  Both on peel street  Your taste buds will not be dissappointed I will be back next Canada Day celebration Happy Travels 
P => Over priced for what it is    I have stayed in several hotels in Montreal and this one is by far the worst re pricequality  The rooms were tacky and dated with filthy windows and everything had a ridiculous price tag attached to it  i e   for a bottle of water that is left by the bed I dont mind paying for good service but I felt like this hotel tries to stiff you from every angle possible and is just about business not client satisfaction  
P => Omni had great service The location of the omni was wonderful  We were able to walk everywhere and the metro was near by for the days that we were tired of walking The hotel staff were wonderful and were very helpful with everything we needed  The rooms themselves are in need of an upgrade but the beds and the pillows were very comfortable  The room was a fair size and the bathroom had all the amenities you needed  The pool on the third floor was nice but was usually covered with shade for the most part of the day  I expected more from the pool facilities but the gym was well done We spent  nights at the omni and were very comfortable there  
P => Great Stay at the Omni My  year old dhter and I just stayed at the Omni for a four day long weekend   we loved it The hotel was beautifully orated both in its public spaces and in its guest rooms  Our room was very spacious and featured a great view of downtown  The beds were the most comfortable Ive had at a hotel in recent memory   supersoft mattresses down comforters and best of all the option of quality feather pillows instead of generic foam  Complimentary beverages of choice were delivered every morning along with two newspapers  The staff were helpful and courteous in every instance  Room service was delivered more promptly than promised   food was ent and reasonably priced  I had a great pedicure in the hotels spa again at a reasonable price and we also enjoyed the hotels swimming pool and whirlpool The location of the hotel is excellent   right off the intersection of Sherbrooke and Peel which is located amongst the main downtown business and shopping district McGill University and Mont Royal park  It is walking distance to almost everywhere youd want to go and for those destinations a bit farther it is two blocks away from the Peel metro station  For those in town on business the hotel is in the heart of downtown   my firms Montreal office was two blocks away and one of our clients was two blocks in the other direction  High speed wireless internet made staying in touch with my office effortless and the desk in our room had sufficient built in plugs to power my laptop blackberry and iPod I would definitely stay at the Omni again whether in town for business vacation or a little bit of both  It was a great value and a great stay  
P => Great Hotel We stayed  nights for a wedding  The hotel is very nice and centrally located to everything in down town Montreal  Check in was good  front desk seemed a little confused but the concierge desk was top notch helpful with directions and suggestions Rooms were in good shape we had  connecting on th floor  Very quite no view we faced down town They delivery hot and cold drinks in the AM for FREE what a great deal we also had milk and cookies sent up free on  days and the first day they delivery a large bottle of water and chocolate  night time turn down service  they did miss one room on one night  We got a  night special for  a night  I would go back in a heart beat  Locations is walkable to shopping and dinning  
P => loved the location We traveled with  friends over Memorial day weekend  All  rooms we booked were different layouts and spacious and clean  The location of the property cannot be beat   you can walk everywhere in any direction to go to Old Montreal residential neigborhoods parks and dining and bars  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and the exchange rate from USD at the front desk was the best aroundWe took the metro up to the Olympic Park amp Botanical Garden and went to the underground shopping mall that runs for miles  We visited countless bars and taverns and all were unique and fun and we walked around for hours to see different neighborhoods and sites  Dont miss the Notre Dame Basilica   it is really unbeilveable 
P => Thumbs Up We stayed in this hotel over the Memorial Day weekend  Great location on rue Sherbrooke West and within easy walking distance to the Peel St  Metro McGill University Bell Centre Museum of Fine Arts as well as all the downtown attractions restaurants and shopping including Old Montreal Nice perks in the room including an umbrella in the closet which we made of use of because it rained during our second day there  Avoid the in room bar and snacks which are way overpriced Money changing at the hotel front desk US to CAD only was at the best rate we encountered in town  Money changers located in small shops all over downtown offered   less  The Montreal Casino offered the poorest exchange rate we encountered Staff were courteous but not overly friendly very helpful and knowledgable Car park was in a nearby underground garage at  CAD per day  Valet parking is also available at about   per day unlimited inout  Given the proximity of the hotel to the downtown and Montreals good public transit save yourself some money if you drive into the city and self park  
P => Pleasant stay I am late in writing my review of this hotel which I have stayed at in il  for a family reunion and again in uary  for a girlfriends weekend through Travelzoo at a great promotional price of  and  a night I would recommend the Omni for its great location close to a large choice of restaurants and shopping area Overall our stay was pleasantthe room amp bathroom clean and spacious The beds were comfortablelinens were good rooms soundproof Would recommend to stay on the th floor or higher for the grand view of the city One complaint for the bedding was that the pillows were too small flat and not enough extra pillows in the room or closet The furniture was a little tired looking The small restaurant on the main floor entrance offered a large buffet breakfast for a reasonable price Did not take advantage of the gym but did visit it and looked well equippedwas very interested in the morning yoga class offered but slept in and missed itA heated outdoor pool was used by my dhter in chilly il The staff at the reception were welcomingwe were allowed to safely leave our luggage at checkout time so we could do some last minute visitingthe concierge was helpful in recommending a good french restauranactually right next door Gar on  is an excellent restaurant with a very good menu professional staff and wide selection of wines I would recommend this hotel to my friends visiting the great city of Montreal  
P => Unhelpful The hotel was prepaid through Expedia but the hotel still demanded day deposit cash for my weeklong stay my credit card had disappeared on the flight  No offer to help block the credit card The room is nothing special and far from modern or stylish  Typical overpriced generic hotel bar  
P => Loved the cookies and milk  Visited Montreal the long weekend of ruary   and stayed at the OMNI Mont Royal hotel with my two kids Great Hotel staff were friendly and very helpful in providing tips on the best way of getting around Montreal  Rooms were spacious well orated and very clean  The best part of staying at the OMNI with kids they gave us chocolate chip cookies and milk each evening mmmm those cookies were so delicious Hotel is in walking distance to the underground shopping malls in downtown Montreal   major bonus as I love to shop Will be going back to this hotel this coming weekend for a girls weekend out  
P => We liked the Omni   good room size excellent service good pool and fitness This was our first stay at the Omni  We had booked a one night stay as I was in town on business  We had a large room with a two seater sofa very comfortable king bed average sized bathroom and nice view towards the north with a partially obstructed view of Mount Royal and an open non obstructed view towards the north east  We found the valet bell hop front desk staff and concerige all uniformally pleasant helpful and informative on everything from restauarnt suggestions to shopping locations and driving directions  The hotel has a very nice pm standard checkout policy which was very helpful for my wife for her exploration of the downtown area The hotel has an outdoor heated pool with a connector tunnel to inside   nice touch for a city hotel  It has a free for guests fitness centre which has generous free weights ent weight machines and ok workout machines The room was clean the temperature control worked perfectly and was quite large with lots of room  There was a desk a two seater sofa and a writing desk in the room with comfortable carpeting  The bathroom was clean and idely average in or and was big enough for two people I would stay here again on business and thought the  price for the room represented good value  
P => Dont believe the positive reviews   or the  stars The recommendation Frommers lists for the Hotel Omni in Montreal and the star rating given to this hotel really need to be revised  Although I have traveled frequently to Montreal and stayed in a number of hotels here Id never stayed at the Omni  ided to take a chance on it given the glowing recommendation in Frommers  What a dissapointment  Cant believe this rates as a  star hotel alongside the W Hilton etc  I booked a quotpremiumquot room and it is HORRIBLE  Ancient uncomfortable bed without enough pillows  Creaky furniture  Chipped paint  Vintage electric floorboard heaters that run too hot  Poor layout cant watch TV from the bed and what looks like an original bathroom from the s dolled up with new bath soaps  A mess of phone and lamp wires tangled around the furniture  A desk that shakes and rattles when you type on your computer  I could go on  Theres a layer of dust coating everything and the room smells musty and of cheap potpourri  This old girl is well past her expiry date  The quotpremiumquot room here is no better than a standard room at the ancient Sheraton down the street for far less the price  If youre coming to Montreal go somewhere else  The Sofitel Hilton XIX Siecle and Place des Armes all offer much better rooms and a much nicer experience at a similar price  What a waste of money  I really dont see any evidence of multi million dollar reations here  If theyve been done then theyve been done poorly  Be forewarned    
P => Good Hotel Stayed at the Omni Hotel during the Christmas holidays  It was a nice hotel  I used the indoor self serve parking which charges per day without multiple inout  The valet parking guy and the doorman werent helpful when I asked them where to park for self parking  The self parking is about  block away and is undergroundindoor  The gym facilities was one of the best gym facilities that Ive seen in a hotel but I generally stay at lower class hotels  I got overcharged in my minibar tab but hotel staff fixed it when I mentioned the items that I had used I was charged for a bottle of water which I didnt use when I only usedhad  bottles of alcohol  Wireless Internet was very stablegood and no problems connecting from my room  For the price I paid it was a nice hotel  However I would not pay their standard rate of over night since it is expensive for the items that I use  
P => Wonderful experience I had a great stay at this hotel  Rooms are large well equiped and clean  Great service and friendly staff  Id definetly choose this hotel for my next stay in Montreal  Its close to the shopping and mount royal  I nice location  My only complaint was some of the electrical outlets did not work in the room making it hard to charge cell phones and laptops  
P => Good and Bad First w the good   the Omni was in a great location and had very professional staff specifically the concierge  They were very helpful in recommending restaurants and bars to go to  The rooms were very clean and the hotel had an upscale feel  There are always cabs in front which is very convenient Heres the bad   We had issues when we first checked in  The lock on our safe was missing and housekeeping didnt come the first day  The second day they called to see if we needed service  Of course we need service When they did come they left old towels and it wasnt as tidy as it should have been  Overall we had a great trip but would try another hotel before going back  
P => Amazing Value Great location pretty ent room large historically old  The pricing of hotels in Montreal is a bargain compared to almost anywhere else in North America this place is bang for your buck 
P => Great stay We stayed here over the long Thanksgiving weekend and used the TravelZoo discount  per night Canadian  The room was quite large and comfortable and the hotel service was very professional  The conceirge staff was helpful in recommending places to eat nearby and in giving directions  The doormen were really friendly too 
P => Always Consistent with Excellent Service Iv seen a few negative reviews on the site lately which I just dont understand  I have no idea why anyone would not love this hotel  This has to be one of the best hotels in Montreal and it keeps up with the high standards of service that the Omni embodies  On my trip over the Labor Day weekend I experienced the same level of service as always  Ive stayed there about a dozen times in the past few years in fact Ive been there  times this year and each and every time the experience has been excellent I am always greeted warmly as soon as I get to the entrance  The conciergevalet are immediately at my side ready to assist  They are knowledgeable and make superb recommendations and offer guidance  Several times theyve gone above and beyond for me  During my stay I was upset because I had broken a fingernail I was about to attend a formal event and needed a repair  Before I could ask for the nearest salon the concierge immediately jumped on the phone called around and made an appointment with a salon and gave me great directions  Then she checked back with me the next day to make sure I was happy  I was  The front desk people are always smiling helpful and friendly and make check inout a breeze  Ive never had a problem or sour encounter  They always remember me and they make an effort to give me my favorite room in the hotel The rooms have always been clean with nice furniture in good repair comfortable bed and great linens spotless bathroom and ample room  The maid turn down and Select Guest service are prompt and always courteous  Well there is that annoying guy who always wakes you a bit early to check the mini bar but thats the only thing I dont like about the hotel   but that is the only thing  Ive found the gym and the spa to be excellent and as far as the complaints about parking well what do you expect for valet service in a major downtown city But you cant beat the location  The Wi Fi always works well and the restaurant and bar are good as well  I love the Omni Mont Royal and would not dream of staying anywhere else when Im in Montreal  
P => Great Hotel This hotel was greatI read the reviews prior to staying and was a little worried  But hotel was very nice  Not sure what the people were upset about I travel a lot and see my share of good hotels and bad and this one is excellent  Rooms are very spacious very clean with all the amenities even bath robes and an umbrella if it rains  check outStaff was very friendly amp helpful This hotel is closer to a  star hotel than a  star Great location walking distance to shopping restaurants Cresent St etc   The Gym in the hotel is amazingrows of treadmills cardio machines free weights weight machines bench press squat racks amp erate froom for stretching  Better than most gyms you pay for You will enjoy this hotel i know I did and will stay there again  
P => Great Location This Hotel is in a prime location right inthe middle of the shopping district of Montreal  With the train just steps away it was easy to get everywhere from here  Mont Royal is just two blocks away walk up the hill for awesome views of the city  Every place you want to go is very accessable by train  Old City Olympic Park the village etc  And you are only one block from Saint Catherine street with all the famous stores and shopping  There is a hot tub and pool which I did use in ember even though it was outdoors because it is heated to  degrees and there is a tunnel that leads to the outside so you do not have to walk in the cold  It also has a great gym inside  The room was very spaceous and had a lot of furnature  I was a little dissappointed with the fact that they charge  for parking even if you are a guest  So do not stay here if you drive because parking is impossible and the meters are  minutes for a quarter  You will nto find parking outdoors at all  But other than that it was great  
P => Location Location I spent  nights at the Omni  I was very disappointed at how run down the rooms were  BUT   my room was nice and large  And the location was perfect   very convenient to everything  the staff and the conceirge desk were overly helpful I would stay here again   but would probably choose a more modern hotel next time  
P => A Great Luxury Hotel  We booked thru Priceline  per nite  for  nites  for a king bed  Hotel is located on Sherbrooke St  near Peel  Pretty central for downtown Montreal  Short walks to Saint Catherine and Crescent Steets  less than  min   The room very comfortable bed table and two chairs couch and a huge bathroom  with bidet   this room was big and classy  and at the price we paid a steal  parking  a day self park  no in and out  is what we did  or you can get  a day valet with in and out priviliges  parking is expensive and driving is crazy in montreal so id recommend parking and walking or taking cabs in the city this hotel had a great gym  as good as most fitness clubs  free weights as well as machines  many treadmills facing big windows  and a huge outdoor heated pool  and also hot tub  we were in the pooltub all three days we were there  all facilities were clean and well maintained concierge  Eddy  was very helpful with directionsinfo we would stay here again in a heartbeat TIPS do the carriage ride thru old montreal   for half hr  what we did   Andre gave us about a  min ride and we tipped him generously  a little history lesson and a respite from walking  a definite highlite of this trip    for an hour tour   walk saint paul st  in the old town  very quiant like old quebec  many great restaurants shops art galleries    take drive up mount royal for view of the city  terrific view and photo op  very romantic too  we got some great pics here  its a short walk from parking to observation area and there is a place at the top for drinks  ice cream  parking is inexpensive  
P => Never again The Omni Montreal  is a horrible run down beat up Hotel I was expecting something nicer than what we found  This Hotel is very worn  nicked up stained furniture in the room  lumpy bed  nasty polyester linens nice and itchy stained and torn carpets in rooms and halls mildew in bathrooms  wallpaper that is jumping off the walls If you are expecting a four star hotel than move on  We moved to another Hotel for an additional  per night  it was so worth it  If you are on a budget and want to party on Saint Catherine or Cresent  than this  be okay  if you are staying for a nice classy get away than stay someplace else 
P => Good Location    Tired Hotel Rooms Just recently came back from a trip to Montreal    Location of the hotel is excellent  Your right in the heart of downtown Montreal and easy walking distance to lots of shoping and good restaurants    However    Was a little surpised to find the rooms outdated    If you need a great restaurant during your visit    Must try Restaurant LAcademie    Its located on St Denis and a short cab drive away    Its a bring your own wine restaurant and there is a wine store next door  
P => Le Dump This place is trired with a capital T Nothing has been re done in over  years  the mattresses are lumpy as well as the pillows  rooms are dirty and furniture is nicked up  Bathrooms are full of mildew  pool area and locker rooms dirty and full of mildew as well  so Bad I would not even attempt to use the whirlpool  The  number made it sound like it was updated  years ago  Even the ble in the common areas was dirty and chipped  In the evening the whole lobby and elevators smelled like fried rice from the restaurant Stay somewhere else The staff was polite and friendly it is a shame that they are running place like a motel Spend an extra  a nite and stay somewhere else  
P => Treated like a queen My husband and I really enoyed staying here for  nights on our first trip to Montreal  The location was great and we felt we got a good deal from booking com of  CAD per night  I had registered for their select guest program and really enjoyed our complimentary hot chocolate and juice in the morning  The bathroom was large and I belive the bed was a King  Overall lots of space  We used the poolsunk a lot and were impressed with the facilities  The only time we needed front desk assistance was when my sunglasses broke and the concierge WALKED us to the nearest optical placeMy criticisms of Omni are minor   tubtoiletsink all seemed slightly clogged and didnt drain fully  The or was not to my personal more contemporary tastes  Bed sagged slightly in the middle We had requested a high up room and were place about halfway up the hotel  Except for sirens we heard no street noise  
P => Great hotel wonderful service Central location beautiful or excellent service warm and helpful staff  They even found an electrical transformer for me  Slight changes needed with curtains and furniture otherwise    fantastic experience  
P => Lovely hotel in a great city This is a gracious old fashioned hotel   We had a large room with two beds and nice bathroom  The beds were comfortable and the easy chair was a great place to sit up all night reading the latest Harry Potter el after a midnight purchase at the McGill bookstore  The staff were very helpful when I had to have documents couriered to me at the hotel after my wallet was stolen on my first night in town  Being in such a professional and well outfitted hotel certainly helped my get through a stressful time  McGill University is just across the street and they have a McGill parents rate  
P => Unpretentious Luxury with a Warm Welcome This was the first vacation visit to Montreal for my wife and me  The problem with this hotel is that it sets ones expectations for everything else in Montreal at such a very high bar  And Omnis Select Guest program brings that bar up even higher  The greeting that we received on the driveway the minute that we arrived set the stage for a wonderful visit  I was immediately given parking options of full valet or reasonably priced self park  We always felt as though we were the hotels most important guests but I guess that everyone else does too  Check in was friendly and efficient and everything was in order without us saying a word  Bellboy service was as professional as we have ever seen  This is not Motel   If you do not appreciate beautifully orated spacious rooms with tapestry drapery luxurious bedding invitingly comfortable seating and work areas a corkscrew and clean stemware invisible wireless Internet service a great shower terry robes soft thick and plentiful towels full bathroom amenities and even a bidet go there instead  The health club and pool at the Hotel Omni Mont Royal is equally top notch  It is clean spacious meticulous in design and competently staffed  And just as it is on a table in the main lobby there is a bowl of complimentary fresh fruit at the clubs reception desk  And restaurantlounge service was at the same level as everything else  We never had to ask it was just there   settings refills extras   and always smiling professional and courteous If we had to find anything in need of attention it might be the elevators computer  The fast smooth domed elevators are finished in rich woods  But often there were more than several people waiting for a minute or two when two cars arrived simultaneously  Of course while waiting we were able to enjoy very lovely and comfortable surroundings Although everything that we saw was new fresh luxurious and clean the dated old fashioned elegance and service kept us delighted  We liked the pampering and we regret that the Hotel Omni Mont Royal has spoiled us  
P => Great base for a Montreal vacation My husband and I enjoyed our recent  night stay at the Omni  We arrived on a Friday around noon a room was available but not on the high floor that we had requested as Select Guest members we were a little flustered to hear our preferences for a king sized bed non smoking room and high floor referred to as quotso many requests that it will be hard to accomodatequot however  so we stored our luggage for a few hours and wandered around downtown  We quickly realized that the hotel is well situated close to the Peel metro McGill University bookstores multiple coffee shops bustling St  Catherine street LEntrecote St  Jean and LActuel and lots of other restaurants including Chez Cora Eggspectation and the Montreal Bread Company the Musee des Beaux Arts Booster Juice and multiple ports of entry to the Underground City and within walking distance of the planetarium and several gelaterias to boot When we checked in to our room of many requests several hours later we were rewarded by a nice corner room on the st floor with a view of the city  The room was clean and spacious the bathroom sparkling  The bathrobe and umbrella in the closet were nice touches as well  The king sized bed was really really comfortable and the curtains though slightly outdated did a nice job of keeping the sun out  The TV had plenty of channels and the small guidebook in the armoire was helpful in finding nearby places to eat We never made it to the pool or gym but free access to guests is a very good deal The hotel was quiet and the housekeeping staff kindly respected the quotdo not disturbquot sign no matter what time of morning it was Overall we had a wonderful stay at the Omni  My only complaints are that we never got turndown service after the first day and we were not offered the Select Guest rewards of morning beverage and newspaper at check in or later in our stay I guess we should have asked but the comment about quotso many requestsquot put us off quite a bit In sumy a nice stay with a few bumps along the way  
P => ok hotel dated rooms I got this hotel for a  bid on priceline which was a pretty fair price for this hotel  The hotel staff was great especially Anne ie at the concierge desk  The lobby and public areas are very nice  I did not try the restaurant or bar  I stayed in room   it was ok but pretty dated  The bathroom lighting was terrible and the in room safe has a key instead of a combination lock so you have to keep up with the key  A sign on the safe also states that the safe is not safe for valuables so use the safe downstairs  The furniture drapes and carpet all are dated not bad just tired The rooms has huge windows mini bar coffee service and good toiletries and one robe  The bed was good but not as luxurious as you might want  Overall a good hotel but I wouldnt say  star  The location on Sherbrooke is great one block from the Peel metro stop  blocks to St  Catherine or the restaurant scene on Rue Crescent  McGill is across the street and the Beux Arts museum is also about  blocks away  
P => Thumbs up Omni   You are simply the best Hotel in Montreal I stayed at the Omni for the th year in a row during the Montreal International Jazz Fest  My room had a gorgeous view of Mount Royal and Sherbrooke Street and was on a high level as I had requested  Bravo to housekeeping for their efforts to keep my room clean every day with plenty of towels and toiletries  The Omni Select Guest program is one of the best amenities they have  I have stayed at other hotels in the area and I dont know of any other hotel in Montreal that offers the guest coffee juice and the morning paper brought to their room at the time they want it all Free The Omni has never let me down with their first class service and friendly attitude  If those of you are reading this and have children the Omni is kid friendly too  Omni staff thanks so very much for making my stay in Montreal a happy one   I will be back soon  
P => Absolutely loved the Omni Mont Royal I stayed in this hotel for the second time in y   For the prices that I paid for both visits through promotions I found on the net this is the best hotel experience I have had in years  The staff are efficient and friendly from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the rooms have fantastic views of the City the beds and linens and towels are superior great toiletries and a wonderful restaurant right in the hotel  Last year I rented a suite and had my dhter come to visit for a few nights  She had her own bathroom and that was also great value  Onsite pool sauna and great fitness room make this my favourite Montreal Hotel which has been maintained and refurbished to perfection  
P => Excellent Full Service Hotel in Great Location Just returned from a two night stay at the Omni Mont Royal in Montreal  This was absolutely the best hotel stay I have ever had  The hotel staff were friendly polite and extremely efficient  The room was large very clean and had a very comfortable bed  The bar on the main level Petit Opus was excellent   good food excellent service  The Amerispa located in the hotels lower level was absolutely incredible  The hotel itself was only about a five block walk from the Train Station and all but one block can be done through the underground city shielding you from inclement weather  You are only one block from the Metro and many excellent restaurants and boutiques are within a few block radius   lunch at Alexanders was incredible and the shopping in the underground city amp on Ste  Catherine Street is fabulous  Something for everyone  An absolutely awesome hotel and one I will definitely be going back to on my next visit  
P => Extremely impressed We stayed at the Omni in late e  for two nights on a family vacation in Montreal  I was travelling with my wife and our eight month old son The front desk staff were extremely helpful and understanding of the challenges of travelling with a baby  We arrived around am on the day of check in and the front desk staff provided us with an early check in  On our check out day the staff provided us with a pm check out two hours past their already generous pm check out to allow us to change our son and get him ready away from the scortching heat before our pm train  A crib was volunteered at check in The hotel room was not only clean and tastefully orated it was huge The concierge desk was excellent and helped to plan a few our our excursions We have stayed at other four star hotels Sheraton Seattle recently and we were MUCH MORE impressed with the Omni and its excellent staff than we have been elsewhere  
P => very nice stay I had a two day stay recently at the Omni in a ior suite  I booked online I am an Omni quotSelect Guest quot During the booking process I had to cancel once then booked the next day moving my dates  Lost my promotional preference on the website as a result grr programmers set a cookie for this kind of thing During room booking I was given the option to let the hotel know about a check in time which I did which was in advance of the standard time  On arrival my room keys and information was ready this was very nice and efficient  I like this concept minimizes the fuss and gets you to your room quickly However when I booked in at the front desk I was on the th floor    previous reviews of this hotel complained about street noise so I asked to be moved up  This request was treated very well some juggling was done and I was moved up to the th floor without a complaint  That room was not ready yet so they let me change clothes in the gym and leave my luggage with the concierge On my return the promotional gift for select guest members was not there bottle of wine I put a call down to the front desk and there was some handwaving and I got the bureaucratic version that since the booking didnt specify it on checkin they were not able to do anything about it right now  I felt that was a bit petty given a guest dropping  for a couple of nights in a suite and that the bottle of wine was probably a  item  I took it up by firing off an email to the Omni Select Guest program and figured that was the end of it  The location of this hotel is excellent on Sherbrooke street close to McGill University and a couple of blocks from all the fun stuff in the area around Crescent street with shopping all around  Nice to be a short and enjoyable walk to the nightlife without standing in the middle of it  Cabs always available at the hotel entrance for airport etc The room itself I found to be very large and spacious it was in good condition two well appointed bathrooms  In room WiFi was complimentary I think this is a GREAT GREAT GREAT thing sorry for the emphasis as it I think is very irritating to check into other fourfive star hotels and get smacked with  per day charges to use internet services  Given that low end hotels routinely provide free Wi Fi its just another way to gouge the client when they bill these crazy amounts for internet service  So tip of the hat to you Omni for your internet policy  The net service was solid On the second day a manager called up about the bottle of wine thing was concerned about working out how the problem happened which is st looking to the source of the issue rather than slapping a bandaid on the problem and satisfying the immediate customer concern only and also offered a bottle of wine on the house to make up for the missing one  I was asked my preference as well which was very nice  I was impressed that someone revisited the issue and with the way it was handled I found the room to be on the quiet side even though it was right in front of the elevators which was greaet  Street noise not an issue at all on the th floor view was mostly good one big building across the street but you see a lot of the city  Im not a TV watcher so cant comment on that bed was comfortable and I slept well  Two robes provided toiletries satisfactory and always good to find Q tips available  Turn down service was delivered around  not a big deal to me if Im in the room I line but I know some people care and its important  Mini bar was well stocked snacks and beverages half bottle of red wine was a surprisingly enjoyable one though I forget now what it was  Usually you get something kind of unrekable but I enjoyed this one I would really rank the hotel the stay and the staff at   out of   is too low for the quality of my stay but I felt it was just shy of   The only thing that stops me from making it perfect is that the in room dining menu was kind of disappointing and quotamerican standard fare quot You know your steak club sandwich grilled chicken etc On the good side the hotel is connected to two restaurants in Petit Opus and Zen  Ive ordered out from Zen before and I guess I was under the impression that the in room dining would feature food from Zen which I was looking forward to  In hindsight I guess I should have called down for a delivery Seems like an odd and round about thing to be considering  Anyway that is the suggestion Id make be it is there and I missed it somehow but would be nice to get that food from Zen easily into my room and into meTheres either three or four elevators hotel is  floors and was mildly busy when I was there  Elevators do matter frustrating when there are not enough and the setup was more than adequate for the size and height of the hotel  They are quite close to the front door also nice getting in and out of the hotel is efficient  Im a programmer so I care about this kind of thing by nature No wasted time Hopefully that is enough detail to illustrate my stay Overall Omni very well done on the hotel and the stay errors and mistakes happen and its normal the true test is always in how you deal with them and you dealt with my small issue very well in the end  I would easily recommend this hotel and would be very happy to stay here again and would not give a second thought to making this my first choice in Montreal  I will definitely grab a take out menu from Zen next time though though 
P => Great Hotel   Great Location Hotel Omni Mont   Royal  Walking from outside you will never expect to see the incredible surprise about the great Lobby they have  Not only very classy but also beautiful  From the furniture to the lighting  Check in was very easy and the staff was very friendly  That is a plus for me  All staff was bilingual especially ie at the Guess Services desk she was very helpful and very friendly  We had a room in the st floor  Having a room in the highest floors helps regarding the noise outside  However all is part of the experience  This is a hotels located in the middle of downtown Montreal  Listening to the outside noise is part of the great experience that is Montreal  Any hotel located in Downtown will have the same noise background  The room was very clean and perfect  The bathroom was huge and very clean  We called several times the housekeeper for different reasons and they helped us every time  A for housekeeping  The view from the room PRICELESS  There is nothing to describe the view from our room  We ided to go and have dinner at ZEN the Restaurant at the Hotel  Another GREAT surprise  ZEN Restaurant was not only very nice and comfortable but the food was quotINCREDIBLEquot  We eat so much and tried many different plates also the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful Did I mention the free wireless Internet ohh yes  In addition if you are a quotSelect Guessquot it s free you get free coffee and newspaper in the morning delivered to your room  WOW  Also if you ide to go out and try one of the many restaurants in Montreal you are just feet away from them and the metro station is next door  We did not go to the Spa but everybody knew is the best around  be next time  I travel a lot for work IM a flight attendant and for fun and stay at great Hotels around the world including other Omni Hotels but I have to give the Omni Mont Royal another star and Diamond for such a great time we had there  Next time we go to Montreal definitely this hotel will be our choice  
P => Excellent location great gym Great hotel formerly the Four Seasons  Central location short walk to business or shopping  One of the best fitness facilities in a hotel lots of equipment modern and up to date in excellent conditon pool hot tub steam rooms in the mens and womens change room and some exercise classes Also offers free wireless high speed internet Parking at the hotel expensive  but not out of norm for a downtown parking lot in the area  
P => Nice place for the price but some issues  I am usually a big fan of Omni hotels bc they are consistent and clean  I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the property in Montreal  For the price it was a great deal but the room needed reating and the carpet was stained  The bathroom was spotless which made up for it and again the price was great but not what I would expect from Omni What most disappointed me about my stay was when I was leaving Sunday morning I wanted a soda for the car ride home and there were not any stores open before am  There was also no vending machine in the hotels   so I went to the cafe where breakfast was being served and asked for a soda to go  I was charged   for the can of soda  I was outraged by this and cant believe that the Omni would take advantage of their customers in such a way  If you dont provide a vending machine then you should not charge anymore for a soda to go then if i sat and drank it in the restaurant  This really left me with a bad taste in my mouth  And I am a select guest member  
P => very nice stay I had only hoped the Omni would be adequate  I selected it because Omnis are generally OK and I could get two free nights with points  That plus the downtown location sold me Well the hotel turned out to be outstanding  For one thing they have a select guest program  Its free and you enroll online  As a Select Guest you get a room upgrade if available and they deliver coffee to your room each morning gratis  If you are like me this is a wonderful thing Downtown is a great place to stay in Montreal  Lots to do and see in walking distance and easy access to the metro This hotel had an outstanding concierge who arranged restaurant reservations for us and gave us guidance on everything from where to find a laundromat to best local breakfast  They also mailed our postcards for us The room was large and very comfortable  One night the hotel sent up a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries  Why I have no idea but they were delicious I am very happy we stayed at the Omni during our recent trip to Montreal and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a comfortable downtown stay  
P => Service surpasses style Great location for our needs and close to the Metro Peel stop     the room itself was very clean    the or was outdated    but who cares because the beds were perfect    the front desk and concierge were friendly and helpful from assistance with maps and directions to postage   we were so busy I didnt try the pool or spa 
P => Thats what I call express check in We were there with our friends for a week end and I must say the hotel was very nice  The front desk staff was really friendly and organized  The fastest check I ever experienced it took minutes just swiped the credit card for icidentals  The room keys were already there waiting for us before we even checked in  The rooms were really nice and the amenities were great Great location and just a few blocks away from Chez Corra a famous breakfast place in Montreal  The price we paied for this hotel was outstanding and I would definitely recommend it to anyone  
P => Omni Mount Royal a great deal I just spent the weekend at the Omni Mount Royal in Montreal  The hotel is in a great location at the corner of Peel and Sherbrooke in downtown Montreal  The hotel itself is lovely and the service wonderful  Rooms are spacious and charming  Even the amenities are great  We didnt eat in the hotel dining rooms but we did have room service for breakfast and it was very nice  The hotel has an outdoor heated pool open all year on the third floor which was a real treat  The only issue I had was that the hottub near the pool but indoors was not heated well and was quite tepid in temperature  Overall I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to fellow travellers  
P => A few problems I stayed  days at the Omni Mont Royal from il th nd  Let me start off by saying Im not the type of person to complain  I hate confrontation so for me to complain then there must have been a significant problem I would have been better off staying at the  star Hyatt and saving  During my entire stay the bellmendoormen were absent however the front desk clerk pleasantly greeted me with quotwe were expecing you quotI signed up for the free OMNI quotselect guestquot program which entiled me to  free cans of coke each morning newspaper and kingnon smoking room preferences even though I booked on an internet site  The in room coffee was superb I had asked for a high floor on  different occassions prior to my arrival  The hotel has   floors but I was only granted the th floor  The front desk clerk made a big deal on how it was a CORNER room so i didnt argue with him The room I was assigned  turned out to be one big problem after another  The Air Conditionong was broken and did not work at all so I had to open the window  The shower head was plastic with some massive water saving device so the water barely came out   The noise from the corner of Sherbrook and Peel was overwhelming and made it impossible to sleep  The mattress was so lumpy you could see the quotun evennessquot even with the comforter on the bed  The windows were dirty and needed a good cleaning  I could hear my neighbors teeneagers at all hours  The hotel allows barking dogspets After  days I asked to be changed to a diferent room because I couldnt take it any more  To his credit a different front desk clerk quickly gave me another room  floors higher room     This was one of the best hotel rooms I ever had  It was the same room size as my original room  just  floors higher with a WORKING air conditioner and a different shower head metal no water saver The shower head in room  was excellent and should be the standard at all OMNI hotels  Im sure the future guest of room  would pay extra to take a shower which has actual good water pressure like in room   The bottom line is the quality of your stay will solely depend on the individual room you get at the OMNI Mont Royal  Every room isnt standard  They are equiped with different shower heads mattressesetc  Ever wonder why some reviews are glowing and some are negative People get the same size room but give different reviews because each room isnt standard The only problem in my new room was that bathtub drain would CLOG after  minutes of shower use and start to over flow  It needs DRANO The noise level from the street is atrocious from the th floor and downward  Soundproofing the windows would be a wise investment as well as the hallway noise through the doorway The mattress was so lumpy and uneven that I had to reverse the pillows and put my head where my feet would usually go  and put my feet towards the head board  The OMNI needs FIRM mattresses  The mattress I had was so soft it would swallow me in The cleaning staff was excellent and respected my quotdo not disturb signquot  even into the afternoon  The views were absoutely beautiful from my corner room  The hotel is in a very desirable safe location near the Peel metro and Saint Catherine street  I would advise not leaving the mini bar key in your hotel room while away and make an inventory of what is there when you arrive The conceirge informed me it would cost  to use the internet for  minutes in the business center when all I had to do was make changes to my airline reservation  Not everyone can take advantage of their free wireless internet  I spoke to a differennt conceirge  days later who allowed me to use the intenrt for free for  minutes  Again like the rooms its all which one you get If I would have been given room  in the first place I would given the OMNI a  rating however when half my stay was spent sleepless and the last day is a travel day it kinda ruins my entire vacation when I dont get a good nights sleep at my hotel  To their credit the conceirge gave me an excellent tip for sight seeing on Mont Royal take a taxi to the quotChaletquot house observation k in the park  Cost about  taxi each way I asked the front desk clerk at am for a  hour place to eat  He recommened Dunns  This is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life  I couldnt even finish my meal it was so bad  Avoid Dunns smoke meat restaurant for late night eating  I recommend getting the  day metro pass for  CAD which is only  more than the  day pass My fave restaurants are the Jardin Nelson the Keg on St  Paul and Gibbys  All are located in Old Montreal The IGA store in Complex des Jardins is wesome and Cafe Depot is open until am on weekends The OMNI Mont Royal has some of the best staff in the hotel industry  I give them much credit and high ks on their well trained staff  The OMNI Mont Royal has a lot of potential and I want to like it  I just wish they would make sure the AC works before assigning a room and make sure the shower head actually has ent pressure  The  things I look for in a good hotel are  firm mattress individually controlled AC that works strong shower pressure  and QUIET soundproof room  It can make the difference between ruining a  day vacation or making it great  
P => Classic style hotel with great location The Omni Mont Royal started its life many years ago as a Four Seasons hotel and it shows  The lobby is small but formal and the rooms are all classic country manor house formal or with mahogany furniture and formal furnishings  The age of the hotel shows mostly in the bathrooms  One much need upgrade since my last visit was the in room wi fi   which thankfully was included in the room rates  Beds and pillows were comfortable as always but the noise levels from the street remain an issue   as is true in most Montreal hotels  I had a Jr Suite which is very spacious and has  full baths  TVs a VHSDVD player a large sitting area with a smallish desk  Live plants make the room feel more personal  Even though the or is very formal but the hotel isnt stuffy and staff is much nicer than at the Ritz Carlton The Omni sits on Sherbrook just a short walk to St Cathrines and the shops  be  blocks from the restaurant area around Rue de la Montagne  The Grey Lines bus depot is also just five minutes walk  You are a taxi ride from Old Montreal Room service is prompt and ent food but as usual its pricey  They have the Opus Bar where you can catch a sandwich or other light meal BLD and Zen a popular Chinese restaurant on the lower level  The drinks at the bar were OK but seemed a bit weak  The bartender was a delightful man and very helpful to all the guests even making dinner reservations for a group when the concierge was busy  They serve a small selection of hor dourves between  and  PM included with drinks They do need to upgrade their TV to something more modern and bell staff was surprisingly absent as was the doorman most days  The plumbing is showing its age but remains good and housekeeping is excellent Overall the Omni just misses being a   but its a solid   
P => Great Hotel Stayed at the Omni for  nights il    th  Found the hotel to be absolutely beautiful and the staff were very friendly  As we speak no french what so ever we are always a bit hesitant to stay in places where the language barrier could be an issue but it certainly was not at this hotel  Everyone spoke English to us and were quite helpful  The room was lovely  on the th floor so we had a great view of the city and water  Bathroom was huge   Bed was so comfy  Lots of mirrors for the ladies as well as a lit makeup mirror in the bathroom  Pool was fabulous nice and warm which was wonderful after a long trip  The location was fabulous with lots of shopping and restaurants  As others have said  make the short trip to Eggspectation for breakfast its a must We drove to Montreal so we had our vehicle with us but with the location you dont really ever need to use it plus it is much easier to take a cab  My only negative comment would be that parking was very high   per day  Will definitely go back on our next trip J  Landry Ont  
P => Excellent Omni Property right near McGill University Stayed at the property for a brief conference ch  rd   As a Select Guest member my upper floor request was granted th floor and was delighted to receive complimentary morning beverage of my choice delivered to my room on time with fresh flowers  Excellent added touch  Select Guest membership is free I highly recommend signing up as the perks are fantastic  Room very spacious king size bed extremely comfortable  Classic elegant room or large washroom  Very quiet on the th floor no city noise whatsoever  Not enough hotels have recycling bins the blue ones in the rooms this should be considered  Room service was promptly delivered and very delicious  Would certainly stay again and highly recommend  
P => Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Omni for  nights over a weekend in ch  Nice hotel with a great location  Our room was quite large with a sitting area and plenty of room for luggage  We orated with a nice bathroom as well We found the gym to be top notch for a hotel gym with a wide variety of equipment and a big selection of free weights  The hot tub and pool were also quite nice We will definitely stay here again  
P => Good Room Good service Great Location I was really pleased with the hotel overall Booked it through Hotels com and got a really great rate  Contacted the hotel on their website and requested an early check in  Room was ready for me when I arrived about  hours before normal check in time  Also requested a late checkout at am of the day I left and got my requested pm checkout time  Got the King Sized room I requested Room was nice clean got a high floor room with a view of the city  The room didnt have any bathrobes as advertised but that wasnt a big deal  Wish they had some finer sheets but thats just a personal thing  They were clean and I guess normal thread count sheets for most hotels  Bathroom was also very clean and well stocked  WiFi worked fine  Elevators are fast  Was very happy staying at the Omni and I do look forward to going back next time I am in Montreal  
P => ent Hotel I spent the weekend here while visiting family  I picked it because it had a great rate on Expedia and it was a perfectly fine hotel  The hotel is well maintained although the or is somewhat dated  The bathrooms were nice and big  One complaint was that there was no mention of internet access anywhere in the room however when I called the front desk they sent someone up with the required bridge within five minutes at no charge  All in all a good hotel to come home to after a day of sightseeing  
P => A nice place to stay Our family of five recently spent two nights at the Omni Mont Royal and we had a wonderful stay  The staff were friendly efficient and helpful  We had two adjoining rooms which were quite large very clean and very comfortable  Excellent sheets Even for New Englanders like us it was still pretty darn cold during our stay in Montreal and the Omni offered plenty to do indoors  The fitness center was very good and well run and we all used it each day we were there  Our main reason for going to Montreal was to look at McGill University and the Omni is perfectly located for that  My dhter was interested in shopping and the Omni is in the heart of the shopping district  If you are looking for the charms of Vieux Montreal the Omni is not the hotel for you  But if you want nice amenities a friendly and professional staff and comfortable rooms at an excellent price I would certainly recommend it  
P => One of the best One of the BEST hotel experiences that I have EVER had I requested a hotel room on a high floor with a view prior to our stay and we received exactly what we requested  We were even allowed to check in at am and were given an even nicer room      just because This is the kind of experience that you can expect while staying at this hotel  The hotels staff were amazing From the itorial staff to management  Everyone always had a smile and friendly Bonjours  The concierege were very friendly and they all had a wealth of knowledge about the city The hotel has a great location  About  block from the Metro station and about  blocks from shopping  About a  minute walk to the Museum of Fine Arts  The room itself was great  It was oversized and had many great amenities  Heater in the bathroom bathrobes toiletries safe iron and ironing board etc  The bedding was very warm and comfortable My cousin and I were here in ruary when the temperature never reached above  degrees so it was always great to come back to a warm SUPERIOR hotel room For the people who have left negative reviews about this hotel     I am greatly confused  I think that either these people are very demanding guests and one little thing didnt go their way so they just ided to make up there minds about the hotel off that one incident or be they just woke up on the wrong side of the bedIf I HAD to give one criticism it would be that the traffic noise is a little more noticable than most other hotels I have stayed in  It is not enough noise to keep me from returning to this EXCELLENT hotel 
P => Great experience at the Omni My husband brought me here on my th birthday    it was wonderfulIve been to Montreal many times and have written reviews on most places  This has been one of the better experiences Prosgreat location close to shopping and restaurantsSUPER friendly staff  courteous and polite and always available for help beautiful affordable spa Amerispa and nice pool and whirlpool  I had a massage but wanted the Vichy shower massage  Will do that next timeclean room and comfy bed Cons  rooms were a little outdated but we had a great suite on a high level facing the city   expensive mini bar and everything else  but arent they all like that   walls were a little thin but no partyers hereWe ate at Cavalli nearby  The food and service was great  For the hip and beautiful I was neither but still had a great experienceHighly recommend this place for a great stay in Montreal 
P => Wonderful hotel We spent Christmas in Montreal and stayed at the Omni  Everything was as booked and the staff were very friendly and helpful  The concierge was extremely helpful in booking a restaurant for dinner Christmas day  The room was big and bright and exceptionnally clean with a small window that opened up to let in fresh air  The small bar was very relaxing and a great place for a night cap  The location is excellent and only a few minutes walk to the centre of Montreal  I would most certainly stay there again  
P => Not just good   great My experience was similar to the previous reviewer  I arrived at the hotel after a long train trip from NYC at  hrs on  and the receptionist who was smiling and very gracious had the booking ready  She said the room was one with a king bed but she could se that we were travelling with our  year old dhter and immediately offered us an upgrade to a larger room with a roll away bed at no extra cost  The room was beautiful   old style but no evidence of wear and tear   we loved it and the bed was heaven after the one in our NYC rental apartment  There was a fabulous view of the mountain and city  The bellboy gave us great directions to a reasonably priced bistro and we received good advice from the concierge again the next morning about the best place for good coffee I am having difficulty finding good italian espresso coffee  The concierge gave us all the information about New Years Eve celebrations and advice on how to dress appropriately   an outdoor venue with a heated dance floor The staff was all fantastic and I cant think of one negative point to make  I will certainly stay again if I am ever back in this part of the world  
P =>  Star Hotel for a  Star Price My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni over the New Years Weekend  What an amazing treat I highly recommend it Booked on priceline and got a SUITE on the th floor with an amazing view for only US including all taxes and fees Room or was a bit outdated but was very clean and the gorgeous lobby restaurants and day spa more than made up for it All staff were friendly and obliging Also you cant beat the central downtown location  We were able to walk EVERYWHERE and the taxi from the airport is CA flat rate  This hotel is such a treat for the price However beware they will charge your credit card for local calls I will definately stay at the Omni again  
P => Nice suite Got to the Omni on Sat  before New Years had my room keys waiting since I am a select guest member but the computer noted my profile preference of one king bed when I requested two doubles when I booked online there were  guys staying in the room so one king wasnt going to cut it  The very kind front desk person Maude aplogized that they had no rooms with  beds left  She offered me an upgrade to a one bedroom suite with a rollaway bed a real twin bed not a rollaway cot for no extra charge  I had a great rate already and there were giving me at least  worth of stuff for free thats how you do it in that industry folks  Too many reviews Ive read say how unhelpful hotels are when this happens and we all know it happens often  She fixed the situation in one minute  I got to the room took my shoes off and the housekeeping person was there instantly with the rollaway bed and offered to set it up right away but we lined wanting to keep the open space in the living room available The room was very nice great view of Montreal the mountain and MacGill Univ  Typical suite with mirrored french doors leading to the bedroom  Had room service one night dont recommend that  The gym and other facilities were nice  Didnt use the spa they were booked solid for two days but it looked very nice  Bell person and concierge were all very helpful staff was A all weekend  Parking was  away for CADnight not too bad  Hotels location is great  Ive read some of the reviews that say how quottiredquot this hotel is and it does show some wear but overall it is still very nice even the first room they gave me was larger than a normal singleking bed room  I would definitely stay here again if I got the great rate that I did night for Sat  and Sun  New Years eve  Dont let the bad reviews scare you off if you get a good rate its still a nice place to stay  
P => Great deal We stayed at the Omni for three nights at the end of ember   We got a fantastic deal from Priceline    US per night  Considering how much we paid we were thrilled with the hotel and the amenities but we would have still been happy even if we had paid a lot more  The front desk personnel were very nice and gracious and even let us check in early when we arrived at  a m  after a red eye flight from the US  The room was cleaned early and very well  The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to museums music clubs restaurants and shopping and a short subway ride to other areas of town  We had no problem at all getting around using public transportation or walking except taxis to and from the airport  There is a very nice jazz club Maison du Jazz about seven blocks away that we went to twice both times without reservations  The hotels gym is the best hotel gym we have ever seen  
P => Above Average Stay And Location The Hotel lies in the ehart of montreal on Sherbrooke Avenue The rooms are larger than average as are the bathrooms  At  storeys the hotel offers a chocie of views with north looking towards the hill in the centre of Montreal and the south overlooking the city core and the river The hotel offers free high speed access a comfortable bed and a pleasant front desk At  plus taxs a winter special the Montreal Omni is a fair bargain  
P => Resting on its laurels First of all if you book this hotel through Hotwire its a great deal  Period  Its their  star customer favorite when searching for Montreal hotels FYI  The hotels also in a great location at the corner of Sherbrooke amp Peel just a few minutes walk from Rue Ste  Catherines shopping and restaurants  But beyond that this hotel is a bit disappointing  This used to be the Four Seasons Hotel as evidenced by the shower controls the Omni never bothered to change  In fact it doesnt appear that Omni has done much of anything to change this hotel   other than the branding   and it seems to be resting on the laurels of its former owners  The furnishings look dated but the bed and duvent are very comfortable  Theres a big tub in the bathroom but a small economy model shower head and the towels arent the big plush ones you expect from a deluxe hotel  One other plus if like me you didnt bring a laptop this hotel has three computers in a small business centre for unlimited FREE access by guests  But overall this is a pretty quotho humquot hotel  
P => Yes I LIked it I stayed at the Omni for an extended holiday for  nights starting on  ober   I payed   a night through Hotwire  Prior to my arrival I contacted the Hotel direct and requsted a non smoking large king bedded room with a nice view  I received exactly that   even though I had secured a discounted rate   I was impressed  I had also signed up to the Omni Guest Program prior to arrival and received free coffee and juice delivered to my room every morning  The room was large  or is dated but the bed and pillows were very comfortable  The sheets were also white crisp linen  Maid service was excellent and the reception staff were very helpful as was the concierge  The free internet access at the business centre was much appreciated  There was a nightly turn down service with a couple of nice chocolates placed on the pillow  The taxi from the airport cost   CA  The Hotel is around the corner from Peel Metro Station and all local shopping including the underground shops and restaurants were less than  minutes away  
P => Good for large dated rooms I stayed here for  days ProsGood locationVery helpful concierge Very Large RoomGreat spa in basementConsVery Dated Hotel Rooms in need of some serious reation  Never seen a   hotel in such poor condition Terrible Service   We found some dried blood on our bed cover  Disgusting  First of all that is not what you expect from a   then for the cover to be removed and not replaced with no apology is also unexpected On checking out the staff did not ask if the stay was fineenjoyable   bad service and no consideration of guestsRooms large as design of hotel is bad   just had too rooms knockered togther with no thought about style If i were too go back to montreal i would not stay here 
P => Company Paid Nice rooms expensive bar great location 
P => You get what you pay for We booked early through Hotwire  Our first night of our honeymoon we were placed in a small room with a king bed  We were able to upgrade on Sunday night to a suite with a lot more room and a nicer view of the city The Omni is very clean  I enjoyed their pool but I wished they had a larger nicer hot tub for all to enjoy  Their hot tub is very crowded and needs reating Room service is outrageous in price  So is their little bar We paid   for a beer  Ridiculous I also wished they had a storegift shop in their lobby  We found ourselves doing a lot of walking around the neighborhood to the drugstore for items like soft drinks and Gatorade The conceirge is very helpful  If you want to go to Le Ronde amusement park you should get your tickets from the Omni and you will get about  off  I also appreciated their restaurant suggestions  The food in that area is SO EXPENSIVE you really need to get out of the downtown area to enjoy the cuisine Also   try the Metro instead of the taxis  We discovered the Metro too late during our stay and that could have saved us considerable time and money the whole trip  
P => Affordable Opulence The Omni is located in the Centreville  Downtown  area of Montreal just below Mont Royal Parc and at the gates of McGill University  It is convenient to shopping dining and the Metro  It is also a good jumping off place for wandering around Montreals other neighborhoods We had a large non smoking room on a high floor  The room overlooked both the Parc and McGill  The room furnishings were both comfortable and tastefull  The bed was especially comfy with fine linens  For those who like to take their laptops along there are great working spaces provided and a quick internet connection  Bathrooms were absolutely fine with a good supply of what you need  why dont all hotels give you Q tips as well as shampoo etc    Best of all the room was spotless   The hotel has a full service health club that is popular with actual Montrealers and is a great place to get info about the city  Hotel guests could use all facilities including exercise equipment steam sauna and pool  After a hard days touring this hit the spot What arates the Omni from the pack is the attentive staff  All of our requests were promptly and courtesously met  The concierge was most helpful with both directions and advise  So go ahead pamper yourself   stay at the Omni  
P => Needs Some TLC The Omni Mont Royal used to be a Four Seasons which is only evident in that the shower fixture still says quotFour Seasonsquot on it  The hotel is very dated   worn carpets or from the early s and a feeling that it has not been remodeled since the Bee Gees were a top  band  The bathroom amenities were a small step up from a Holiday Inn   and were not fitting for a  star hotel However with that saidThe Omni Mont Royal does have some very positive aspects   a good location very comfortable beds we slept VERY well an outdoor pool ent gym and access to free Wireless internet  The view of Mont Royal from our high floor room was beautiful  The staff concierge and front desk was also very friendly though the doormen didnt ever seem to hold a door open The hotel needs some love and attention and is by no means a four star quality establishment but if you are not picky about style and amenities and care more about location and get a good price it is a ent place to stay  
P => Nothing But Praise for the Omni Having used Priceline for our reservation I was expecting to be given a less than warm welcome as is often the case with some hotel chains upon check in especially as we arrived very early  However I could not have been more wrong the man at reception was delightfully professional worriedly asking my companion and I whether  size beds would be adequate for our needs as otherwise he d be unable to check us in that moment  We were more than happy with what he offered having called to request a quiet room on a high floor Sherbooke and Peel being one of Montreal s busier downtown intersections all of our requirements were met with seemingly no trouble  Armed with three mornings  worth of  complimentary beverage  door hangings a super perk for Select Guest members we found our room on the th floor to be everything we could want and more  With plenty of floor space and classic sophisticated d cor then room felt rather like a small apartment  A spotless bathroom and closet with bathrobes an umbrella iron amp board and spare linens shows that serious thought has been put into guests  convenience and comfort here  In short the Omni exceeded our expectations both in terms of room quality and amenities and in the fantastically courteous friendly and calm way in which every employee we encountered conducted themselves  I would certainly stay here again if the opportunity arose and would wholeheartedly recommend it  
P => Loved it I stayed at the Omni this past  and was pleasantly surprised My boyfriend and I managed to get a reasonable rate at hotels     with our rd final night free so I was almost worried as to why it would be so inexpensive  But we had no problems at all  We didnt have the greatest view facing the pool and street but we were on the th floor and didnt really mind or bother to say anything  The bathroom was huge the room was clean and the pillows were SO comfy What more do you need We didnt really need any special arrangements and this place was great    So I would say that if you are looking for a mini splurge without breaking the bank or expecting rose petals at your feet this is a wonderful place to stay  By the way location is great too   around the corner from the metro and lots of restaurants and shopping  For breakfast you must MUST try a small diner style restaurant very young hip crowd called quotEggspectationquot   its just about a  block walk and it is SOOO good for a great price just ask for directions at the hotel desk  
P => Great location enjoyed the poolgym My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni for our  day  night stay in Montreal  I had read some reviews on TA and was quite reserved about staying here because the reviews were nothing spectacular  I was pleasantly surprised  The room was not huge but it had a comfortable king bed good size bathroom and the room was overall very neat  We also had a pool view on the th floor and it was a very quiet room even the ice machine right outside our room caused no distrurbance  We were extremely satisfied with the pool and the jacuzzi  My boyfriend used the gym and said it had the majority of the machines he needed  The location was superb near a subway stop and walking distance to Rue St Catharine  I would recommend this hotel but dont expect to pay  a night  
P => Loved the Omni Recently stayed at this hotel   I loved what the Omni had to offerFrom my check in to check out I was treated like royalty  The hotel is in a great location and you can walk everywhere  Lots of shopping and great restaurants in the immediate area    I now know why the call this area the Golden Square MileMy room was on the th floor and had a wonderful view of the city was spacious and very nice  Large ble bathroom was also very nice as was the nightly turndown service  All of the staff was very attentive and went out of their way to ensure we had a excellent stay  Zen restaurant was great for those who love Szechuan food and I highly reccommend it  There is also a beautiful spa in the hotel Amerispa and my boyfriend and I took full advantage by having a waterfall massage    just heavenly     All in all I would come back with pleasure and the Omni is my new address in town when visiting Montreal 
P => Location Location Location Great Hotel near the subway LOVED the Gym  The staff is really helpful and knowledgeable  I used this hotel on a business trip but will come back on an extended weekend getaway  
P => Omni was cool The Omni was a nice hotel My boyfriend and I went on a weekend getaway  We got a good deal on hotwire so i cannot complain     Location It is definitely a GREAT GREAT GREAT location  Walking distance to everything In the heart of downtown walking to mont royal crescent street vieux montreal longer walk   if you ide you want to take the metro the Peel Station is half a minute away  It was definitely a great great location  Cannot stress that enough Hospitality The staff was great no complaints there Room Rooms are not huge but they are comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size  The only complaint i have about the room is the door the hotel needs to update their system i think it is faulty sometimes when it is reading the card becuase a whole bunch of times it was war trying to open the door with the room card and that was very inconvenient The staff was gracious and accomodating nevertheless Style Room could be updated a bit style wise those curtains are like quotcmon pplquot but overall it was a nice room we had our time which was most important   the bed was comfortable so who cares about the curtains   everythign else looked nice   so overall it was cool PoolJacuzzi   Okay this was lame   It closed at pm   that i didnt like  Parking You could park for   a day at an open lot or drive  mins away to mackay and boul massoineuve and park for  a night  parking in the hotels garage i think was like night   still not bad Overall I liked the Omni   we paid   of what the prices were so we definitely were happy  
P => OK for Business Travel Stayed at the Omni for a conference in    Had a large room with a king size bed table desk small couch    but the carpet was drab and spotty as others have noted  Overall impression was of an older hotel with traditional furnishings  I didnt spend a lot of time in the room but if I had the awkward placement of the TV not really viewable from the couch would have been inconvenient  Along the same lines the towel rack in the bathroom was around a corner and over the toilet so dont forget to grab your towel before you shower I liked the shower though    good and strong    as well as the bathroom amenities  Front desk staff was very nice and concierge was OK  Wireless internet access in the rooms was great  Room service food was a bit above average  No coffee maker in the room  Conference service seemed quite good including continental breakfast and snack set ups My room looked out onto Sherbrooke and I could hear some street noise at night despite being on the th floor  Hotel is in a good central location partly because downtown Montreal is pretty compact  Close to the Peel Metro stop and the Underground and about four seriously steep blocks from the Park Mont Royal with its spectacular views of the city   dont miss it Ill probably try a different hotel if I go back to Montreal just to see what else is available  
P => Fine if you get a good price I stayed  nights at Omni hotel in Montreal from ember   until ember    I booked my stay through Hotwire and I got a good deal I paid  a night The reason I choose Omni was that I in e  stayed at Omni in San Francisco and was very pleased with my stay at Omni in San Francisco  Therefore I thought I could try Omni Montreal since Hotwire had a good deal during my stay  I also had become an Omni Hotels select guest member and I thought it would be nice to get a newspaper some beverage in the morning and a late check out  Omni Hotel in Montreal has a perfect location one block to a liquor store two blocks to Saint Catherine and all the department stores have a good but pricy Chinese restaurant in the premises you could open a window about cm the TV had ent number of channels the bathroom was very big the room was of ent size the housekeeping was fine the complimentary wireless internet worked perfectly and since I was a select guest member I was allowed to have a late check out at pm  In general I am not sensitive for sounds and through my Omni Hotels select guest membership I had asked for a quite room away from the elevator and on a high floor  Unfortunately I got a corner room on the nd floor with a connecting door  During the weeks when nobody else was staying in the room beside me it was ok even if I could clearly hear the elevator and the ice machine  But during the weekends when the room beside me was occupied it was like having those people staying in my room  The connecting door did not stop any sound at all and the last night my neighbors were partying all night long and I could not get any sleep at all  If you have stayed at Omni in San Francisco you will probably be disappointed with Omni Montreal  But Omni Montreal is a good choice for Montreal and if I could find a good deal at Hotwire I would not hesitate to stay at Omni Hotel in Montreal again  But this time I should ask for a room with a non connecting door to get a good night of sleep  
P => An enjoyable stay We ided to stay at the Omni because of its proximity to McGill having stayed last year at the Spring Hill Suites in the old city which we had found to be excellent with spacious rooms and good parking In fact the two connecting rooms which made up our ior Suite at the Omni were even bigger  They were vast and exceedingly pleasant on a high floor and bathed in light  Each room had its own bathroom although only one had a bed  The quality of furnishing and maid service was high and the only blemish was the mysterious absence of a coffee maker although the hotel did supply one free of charge on request We dined at the nearby Le Taj Indian restaurant which serves mildly flavoured and quite delicious food the five course Feast is terrific value Montreal appears to become a ghost town at weekends  I went for a walk to get my wife a Starbucks coffee at   but none of the three nearby places opened before   am two of them being located inside stores which didnt open until then and the streets were deserted  
P => Not Bad For Its Value Hotel is in much need of a reation  While I do agree with many that its not bad for its price my stay at the hyattwhich was comparable in price was much more enjoyable  The valet people are definitely lost it took forever trying to get the car and handing the keys back to them was even more a task  Overall i got a great deal through hotwire  a night so I cant complain  The complimentary wireless internet was a definite added bonus and the spacious rooms were plus points  However the furniture is worn and scratched and the carpet was a victim to several stains  If your getting it through hotwirepriceline the hotel is pretty good deal but if your paying rack rate I would jump across the street to the sofitel  
P => Fair accommodation for a fair price For a downtown hotel I dont think having a coffee maker in the room is too much to ask  And parking in the area was extraordinary expensive  CAD for four nights  It was also disappointing that the maid didnt service the room one day The downtown area shuts down on the weekends  However the room was spacious and the bathroom was pleasant  The carpets definitely need changing  permanent spots throughout  The concierge Giovanni was fantastic and friendly  The metro is close and the space is overall clean  
P => IIt all depends on what you pay I travel to Montreal regularly on business and was attracted to the Omni by the very competitive rates available on the internet  I last stayed in this hotel over twenty years ago when it was run by Four Seasons and was at that time an important part of the Montreal social scene Today it is only a pale shadow of its former self The hotel is tired and run down and in need of some TLC Omni seem hell bent on operating this hotel at the lowest possible cost  For example the hand basin in my room was badly cracked carpets needed cleaning the hotels exterior signs were only half lit etc  Also the food offerings are pricey and limited However all this notwithstanding the hotel is basically a good property with an excellent location and spacious and well appointed guest rooms and windows you can open  You can thank the Four Seasons people for these virtues  If you can book this hotel at a reasonble rate then will be getting value  If you have to pay the rack rate then go cross the street to the Sofitel where you will find a hotel run by enthusiastic professionals  
P => Romantic Getaway Great price for the area amp it was during Valentines Day week  The hotel itself was great staff was friendly amp informative when wanted directions to various hot spots  The location is superb forget about staying at boutique Hotels in Old Montreal Omni is where its at  Near St Catherines Street which is great for shopping amp despite the cold me amp my boyfriend walked to Old Montreal which was about  minutes in the  degree cold  Also prime locations to get to St Laurent which has some of the best Lounges amp bars  The only problem was parking but that was due to the area expensive and scarce  Would definetly stay at the Omni again amp take advantage of their indoor sauna amp whirlpool  
P => Such a memorable stay Recently I have discovered the Hotel Omni Mont Royal What a beautifull amp gorgeous hotelI had never heard about it until some colleagues of mind told me they had host successfull meetings there and that enjoyed the quality of service offered by the staffMy mother and I had to go to Montreal for the graduation of my sister at McGill and we did not know where to stay Weve ided   why dont we try the OmniFirst of all once you enter into their luxurious lobby   you really feel like you are a star    and the courtesy of the entire staff make you feel just like homeOur room was perfect spacious offered a magnificient view over the McGill University Campus and Mount Royal Park and provided the confort we needed after our  hours flight  We also enjoyed their gym with its outdoor pool and their spa   the perfect way to finish our stayThe food was also excellent  We strongly recommend the ZEN RestaurantReally staying at the Hotel Omni Mont Royal was a pure charm  We will definitely go back to this hotel that makes luxury so accessible 
P => What a great hotel Recently stayed at this hotel for the weekend with my fianc   The hotel is really well located within walking distance to St Catherine street main shopping area  Not far from two of the citys happening places Crescent street and St Laurent Boulevard As soon as we checked in we were greeted warmly by all the staff  Ask them about the Select Guest program Our room faced the Mont Royal mountain and we had a beautiful view  The room is very classic in or but is very spacious anc comfortable  The bathrooms are great as well all ble  We both really enjoyed the gym which is huge We also got to enjoy the spa at the hotel Amerispa which is very extensive and brand new I highly recommend the chocolate mocha body wrap We also tried ZEN restaurant out   Really great szechuan food served buffet style to your table  The crispy duck was too die for All in all a great time   I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a luxurious hotel with a great value in a superb location in downtown Montreal  
P => Good Hotel Horrible Concierge We just returned from a  day stay at the Omni  The Omni has tough competition for the same price Sofitel Ritz and a plethora of boutiques but I was pleased with our visit  The only complaint I have is that the Concierge is absolutely horrid  I had never been to Montreal before and she was very reluctant to make any suggestions   and when she did they were horrible  I asked her what we could do to get a good feel of the city and her response was quotwhat do you want to doquot and I said quotsomething I cant do in Pennsylvaniaquot and she responded that we could quotDRIVE AROUND VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY quot We dreaded having to ask her for restaurant or sight seeing advice because it was a  minute ordeal to get a suggestion from her  If youre looking for great service stay elsewhere  
P => Great hotel Great rates Did the previous reviewers stay at this hotelThe hotel exceeded my expectations especially for an Expedia special rate of   CADnight Do yourself a favor and sign up as a quotSelect Guestquot on the Omni web site Very clean huge room and a bidet in the bathroom  Staff is very friendly helpful and attentive  The hotel is close to shops transit food and entertainment Dont eat in the hotel the food is expensive and lacks selection  The buffet breakfast has less selection than Golden Griddle at almost X the price    tax  There are hundreds of dining options less than  min walk away I reccommend Reubens for breakfast lunch and dinner  
P => Nice Hotel Visited Montreal for the weekend  Took a chance with Priceline and got the room for approx  US  taxes Former Four Seasons hotel it is a nice hotel with a great location  The room while small was very nice and clean  Staff very pleasant  
P => You can rely on the omni for a little luxury Similar to a previous reviewer we chose the Omni in Montreal after a stay in the Omni Shoreham in Washington DC Thankfully the staff in Montreal were a lot nicer than in Washington and were very polite and helpful throughout the entire stay  One thing you can be assured of with the Omni chain and that is a little luxury and fantastic surroundings   ble chandeliers and bathrobes galore Unfortunately also bathroom scales   no need for those on a holiday please We couldnt fault any aspect of the or facilities or cleanliness of the bedroom or the hotel in general We had a meal in the bar restaurant on arrival which was excellent and good value for money  At breakfast however we didnt think two cups of tea one bowl of raisin bran and two portions of toast should have cost CAD   but it did The buffet breakfast did look good but after weighing ourselves on those bathroom scales we didnt think it was a good ideaWe felt a little bit out of place with all the business breakfasts going on  We desperately tried to find a back door ouf of the lobby one night when guests for the Chancellors dinner came in past us  Them in their tuxedos and ball gowns and us after a hard days sightseeing in jeans and scruffy shirtsParking is provided via a car park one block over   it costs  CAD per day for valet parking and  CAD per day if you park it yourself  The location of the hotel is super   easy to find off the expressway Rue Sherbrooke is one of the main roads in Montreal and very central to everything and to my husbands distress the shops   Rue St Catherine All in all the Omni was great an excellent hotel which has a habit of selling rooms really cheap on the internet 
P => What a Great Spot I discovered the Omni by chance during a spur of the moment road trip to Boston  That was early this summer and since then I have visited the Omni in Washington D C and most recently the Omni in Montreal  Each experience has been wonderful  The Omni in Montreal is excellent in terms of location  It is two blocks away from St  Catherine about four from Crescent and a short cab or metro ride from Old Montreal and the St  Laurent area  It is also near in distance from Mont Royal but that is a trek uphill so for lazybones a cab ride is best It is also around the corner from the Peel Metro stop  I would recommend taking advantage of concierge services  they are very thorough and are happy to help  Unfortunately I did not snap pictures but I will tell you that the rooms are a nice size kingqueen bed loveseat work desk entertainment console without looking crowded and the bathrooms larger than most other hotels The pool is outdoors and heated  I wish I had known that being that Montreal had great weather the weekend I was there Enjoy 
P => Strike Ongoing but Service Was Top Notch Yes the strike is still on so we enjoyed some s music Whitney Houston is going to force management to meet their demands on scheduling and plenty of shouting whistle blowing and drumming as we entered the hotel  As far as we could tell the weekend strikers volunteers perhaps were much more agressive than the weekday crowd Service was top notch despite the strike    quick valet parking helpful concierge super fitness center with fruit towels tons of lounge chairs huge workout area lots of machines for a hotel based facility  We stayed as a Priceline reservation  a night so it was an exceptional bargain  Within close proximity of several family friendly restaurants including Le Taj for Indian and Chez Cora for super fruit focused breakfast  
P => Great hotel strike still on We stayed   the Omni   and the staff was just wonderful  The strike is still on and getting noisy but the hotel was great about it  They were kind enough to move us to a room on the other side of the hotel and up to the nd floor but by day  of our visit the strikers ided to parade around the building blowing their whistles and pounding on drums Anyway Zen restaurant was great and the concierge most helpful  The room was clean and even though we were next to the elevator and the ice machine it was quiet except for the strikers  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Omni and would go back again  
P => It real look nice and chilling it good for emtertainment We were footballers send to play with a club in canada we stayed in omni royal hotel canada montreal  It was soo Good and nice to be there  they were lot of fun there  confortable dinning room we stayed  i wish you too can go have a try of it  they have delicious meal and chocolate drink there  and many more which is not meet to be mentioned on net  have a nice day friend and dont forget to make your wise travel by staying in omin mont royal montreal canada  
P => ok this is a   stars with the old bones of a  star hotel   only go if you get a very good rate nothing special really here    
P => Great hotel and location We just spent a week in Quebec half of it in Montreal and this was my favorite hotel on the trip  The rooms are spacious we had a king room the location is perfect    downtown but within good walking distance of Old Montreal and an easy drive down Sherbrooke to the botanical gardens    and the bed was great  Id highly recommend it  If you want to be in the old city however you  choose something a little closer to that part of town but youd be missing out on a lot of downtown activity  
P => First Class Service and the View of Mont Royal Not Bad Either I just recently stayed at the Omni for the th of y weekend  I really enjoyed the fantastic service and helpfulness of the staff  After I signed up for the Omni Select Guest program I also recieved an upgrade to my room along with fresh coffee and juice every morning for the duration of my stay there  My room was a nice large size and kept clean daily  The perk as well was a lovely view of Mont Royal Shopping is close by as are fine restaurants and some of the major attractions  The Omni in Montreal is a fine hotel I am sure they will make your stay a memorable one  
P => Great service and location Ive stayed at the Omni many times over the past  years and always had something often missing in Montreal business hotels   good service  The Omni was a Four Seasons and when the property changed hands most of the well trained staff stayed  They are professional and helpful  Room service is very good and managed well  The only thing the hotel really lacks is a good bar area for resting with a drink after work  The biggest negative is the streetside rooms are noisey and bathrooms could use some updating  The hotel was built without the sound proof glass  Beds are good ore formal I had view of Mount Royal and McGill University on each visit  There are a lot of very good resturants within walking distance but there were always cabs available  A short walk from St Cathrines Montreals main shopping street as well as museums its a very good location for those in town primiarly for business  
P => Great Hotel Just completed a stay at the Omni Mont Royal for a business conference and had a great experience  The staff was very helpful and the rooms were great very large with nice furnishings and large ble bathrooms  Coffee and paper were outside the door each morning at the requested time and a fully staffed business center offered free use of computers for internet access and printerscopiers  Location is a little away from other downtown hotels but great restaurants nearby and Metro station within a block to get around Montreal  Recommend this hotel very highly  
P => Great location great hotel We stayed here over Easter weekend and had a wonderful time  It is close to just about everything either walking or by cab  The Asian restaurant in its basement Zen is very good but then its hard to have a bad meal anywhere in Montreal  I especially like that this hotel is up the street from Premiere Moison a great place for breakfast lunch or just coffee and pastries any time of day Beware if you need two beds  I requested  in my reservation and when I showed up although I got an upgrade to a ior suite all that was available was rooms with king beds  I was told that they have very few rooms with  beds   not really sure why they have made that ision unless its to keep folks with kids away  The bed itself was OK a little firm   not the heavenly bed at many chains  Although we were on the th floor it was still a little noisy from the street which can be busy all night   next time I would skip the ior suite if it meant a little more quiet  Bathroom was nothing special but clean  A feature of this hotel is its pool which is outdoors entrance is from inside and heated so you can swim anytime  They also have a pretty good gym for those used to working out in one  I found service to be very good   we neglected to have reservations for Easter brunch and the front desk did everything they could on Saturday night to get us a reservation for the next morning although most restaurants were booked  They got us in at a great restaurant around the corner from the hotel If you ide to stay sign up through the Omni Hotels site for their preferred guest program  Theyll send you upgrade coupons you can use for your stay  
P => Love The Omni Talk about catering to your every need     The Omni Hotel did just that  I recently stayed at the Omni over Easter weekend with two other friends and we have nothing but rave reviews for the hotel  The health club is outstanding boasting a whirlpool outdoor pool sauna steam room and a complete gym consisting of free weights and cardio equiptment  We are all from the Philadelphia area and demand alot when we stay at a hotel  The Omni met our every desire  The staff was friendly knowledgable and very very eager to please  The room was very spacious comfortable and clean  Everyone was so pleasant to us right down to the cleaning woman  The valet George was an outstanding man with a personality to match  I plan on staying in this hotel everytime I visit Montreal The staff and the establishment classify as a class act in my mind  
P => Terrific rates for high quality hotel Stayed here for a couple of nights attending a conference  Hotel is a few blocks north of the malls  If coming in the winter there are closer hotels attached to the underground so you never have to put on a coat  So if you do not mind going outside and walking a few blocks to the shops than this is a hotel for you  Service was superp altways trying to help  Pool is a great touch especially for kids to swim outdoors in a snowstorm One negative however is the Zen Chinese restaurant  They bring you a menu that only has a  dollar price fix for two people you can pick   dishes  If you are not that hungry and ask they will bring you an ala carte menu but ordering soup rice and one dish is almost the same price so it is better to go with the price fix menu  However the food was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted  Very bland  The hot and sour soup was like paste  Take a taxi to China town and get a better meal at half the price  
P => Great location Just got back from  nights at The Omni  The Omni is a nice hotel in a great location  I wouldnt say it is a  star luxury property but it is nice in the Laura Ashley style of or  The rooms were very big and we found the wireless internet connection a big advantage as we bought our laptop  The staff were friendly  The outdoor pool was a elty in the middle of uary   you swim through a tunnel from indoors to the outdoor part of the pool   warm enough as long as you stay under the water  The Amerispa in the basement was an excellent Spa with great rates and Zen Chinese restaurant was nice too  I would definately stay here again but I wouldnt pay alot of   It would have to be a good room rate  
P => Upscale Hotel The Omni Montreal is an upscale luxury hotel at a fair value  The rooms are magnificent and the service matches  Located in the heart of Montreal across from McGill university and just north of St  Catherine st  Close to a variety of shopping and restaurants  When they say quotCan I park your carquot you should  Driving is nuts 
P => Hotel is great  Hotle omni is good in everything  talking of comfort the hotel is good enough in comfort  The last time i visited the hotel with my uncle that stayed in califonia i really had a nice time  yes it hsa to be rated among other hotels thanks  
P => Omni Mont Royal Hotel   A Fabulous Hotel We stayed at the Omni Mont Royal Hotel for  days in ember   We were welcomed at the front desk and able to check in prior to noon  The room was spacious and beautiful  The bathroom was all ble and quite large  Our experience with the concierge desk was always pleasant and helpful particularly from one specific individual  The hotel had some conferencesmeetings going on during our stay but that did not interfere with our stay at all  Housekeeping cleaned the room twice a day  The location is excellent  It is close to the Metro subway walking distance to the shopping malls and close to great restaurants amp bars  We would highly recommend this hotel     pick 
P => The Poor Mans Four Seasons If Montreal is the poor mans Paris then the Omni Montreal is the poor mans Four Seasons Hotel  The Omni was originally the Four Seasons and some of the glamour is still there  It has uniformed doormen and a large Four Seasonsesque flower bouquet in the lobby  Unfortunately since its such a large hotel and is probably empty most of the time perfect upkeep has ceded to very good upkeep  That is its mostly clean but looking a little tired cracked sinks old upholstery and a Four Seasons shower fixture signal its time for reation  Still where else can you get a clean large room with modern amenities huge bathroom lovely king size bed and a th floor view for  CDN a night Its in a perfect location and was an outstanding value  
P => Mixed bag I stayed in the Hotel Omni in ust   Valet was very unclear on the rates of the parking and takes awhile to retrieve your car even when I called ahead of leaving valet or self park  reasonable rates and safe though  Theres plenty of street parking around if you want to look for it  Very snobby front desk staff  the Montreal atittude I call it  Hotel was very nice and polished ble floors or etc  Room was an odd shape very long and narrow and missing a fridge but comfortable and clean though more is expected from a  star hotel  Location on Sherbrooke is convenient to shopping district St  Catherine and restaurants Crescent St   a bit farther from tourist places like Vieux Montreal and St  Laurent but definitely walkable  
P => not that great This hotel does not have two double beds so useless for people with two young kids their choice is King or Twin Beds  not more than  people in a roomAlso the bathroom had hair all around the sink so not very clean and elevators are very slow Contsruction going on around the area expensive parking all in all not a great bargain We loved the Le Centre Sheraton in Montreal much nicer area and absolutely lovely hotel for adults and children  
P => Our new favorite Hotel in Montreal This was the best hotel experience we have had in our many trips to Montreal  Previously stayed at the Vogue Montagne Le St Sulpice amp IntercontinentalThe location is fabulous in the middle of everything yet on beautiful fairly quiet Sherbrooke  We arrived at  pm and our express check in was ready  We were given a brief tour of the hotel and shown to our upgraded premium corner room on the th floor with a view of the city and Mt  Royal  The room was very large with a king bed desk amp chair loveseat round table and  more chairs  It was more than comfortable it was spacious and elegantly furnished The hotel pool and gym were wonderful treats in the middle of the city  This is a heated outdoor pool with indoor access so that it is used all throughout the winter  We also took advantage of the Amerispa which is on the lower level  The services were outstanding  I loved my facial  they used Darphin products and my husband was thrilled with his massage  They book up very solidly so make reservations as soon as you know you are going  He could not get a second massage appointment Breakfast was in the Petit Opus restaurant on the main level and consisted of a lovely buffet as well as an ala carte menu  We booked through American Express Platinum fine hotels and Continental breakfast was included  We added the buffet for an additional   CAD per person  
P => The Omni the best the french have to offer We stayed at the Omni on the weekend of the comedy festival y th so it was very busy and completely booked  The Omni deserves its five star rating  We were given a quotpreferred guestquot room on the th floor  It was a deluxe room with everything you could possibly need  There was wireless internet everywhere in the hotel  The pool and the workout room was excellent and very clean  They gave us an amazing parking spot on the driveway of the hotel literally  feet away when you stepped out for  per night  It was an amazing deal  The staff was so great  The preffered guest card allowed you free turer service chocolates on the bed and a free fresh beverage every day outside your door in the morning with your newspaper  I would recommend this hotel I dont know why people gave it such poor reviews  Its the best hotel weve ever stayed at in Montreal  The staff was AMAZING  They were so friendly it was unbelievable  Dont listen to the snobby people if you get a deluxe room with your preferred guest card available on their site Im sure you will be as happy as we were  There just isnt a better hotel than this in my opinion  
P => Was ok I stayed at this hotel in    I have no complaints about this property  However the rooms are very quotgenericquot hotel and dated  Nothing special and wont stay there again  I would recommend the Sofitel which is directly across the street  
P => Foods are good but the waiter is bad The foods are good comparing with the price but the service is really bad  If I dont remember it wrong the waiter is call Gary  Whatever we requested it takes so long for him to bring it to us  But we always saw he had plenty of time to chat with other waiters  I dont know if I am too picky and I hope he is the only worst waiter in this restaurant otherwise the whole restaurant will get ruin by such kind of services  
P => LOVE IT Weve stayed at the Hotel Omni Mont Royal MANY times and LOVE IT Its beautiful in a great location right in between St  Catherine and Rue Sherbrooke and they seem to treat everyone very well regardless of quotstatus quot Weve strolled in with bags and coolers and everything and they didnt seem to think we were tacky at all even if we were The staff is always very friendly and very attentive and want to know how your stay is going and if you need anything  Some of the rooms are really big and some are small BUT NOT TINY  So if space is an issue for you make sure you specify All the rooms are lovely though  Someone on this Website said quotoutdatedquot in one review but Ive never seen that at all  Its very traditional Queen Anne type furniture but not old or run down  
P => Adequate Lodging   with some nice ammentities Stayed at the Omni only two nights  Got a  night deal on priceline which made it worth the stay  The room we had was ent king bed clean bathroom some cable room service was good but unfortuantely no coffee maker  The pool is heated outdoor with an entrance from indoors which was nice  The hot tub and workout facilities are nice as well  The valet parking is steep at  per night but you can park behind the hotel at a garage yourself for  a day  The hotel is in a ent location  block from the underground mall and subway  I would agree with other reviews that the hotel is more like a nice  star than a  star but adequate if you get a ent price for the room  
P => Not a  star property The hotel rooms at the Omni are  s vintage with somewhat tasteful or Outdated bathrooms and when I requested a larger room with a bigger bathroom I was told that all the rooms were the same This is a  star hotelThe valet parking is the most expensive downtown Breakfast was only average but again pricey I have complained about my experience to the management and am awaiting their reply I will write back with their response Until then I will be staying across the street at The Sofitel next time  
P => Omni Mont Royal My husband and I just returned from a three night stay at the Omni per the info on this web site  We felt that the hotel was very tired and could use an overhaul  The same candy wrapper was on the floor for three days every time we got off the elevator  We had a premium king room which was a good size and a great bathroom but the amenites in the bathroom were just ok  The furniture in the room was a little dated and rickety  We ate at the Zen the first night and although the food was good the service was lousywe waited  minutes for our meal  This hotel was quite expensive for what it was we would probably stay at the Sofitel the next time  
P => A Great Hidden Treasure in Montreal I just spent  night weekend at the Omni Hotel in Montreal and was so impressed by the or the room the staff the service the restaurant and the facilities The Omni is situated only two blocks from Ste Catherine Street where all the action and shopping is  Although the exterior of the Omni is nothing special the interior or is very elegant and stylish  The staff including the concierge are very professional and helpful  The rooms are good size and the bed is amazing it is actually very comparable to the Westins heavenly bed if you ever had that  We had a weekend getaway package which included a beautiful room overlooking Mont Royal and a complimentary breakfast for two  The rate was very affordable and the breakfast was delicious I picked the Omni because it was rated the   hotel to stay at in Montreal  I will attest to that 
P => Pleasurable Stay at The Omni Mont Royal We enjoyed our stay at the Omni Mont Royal  The location is equidistant to most areas a tourist would want to visit  Close to the Peel Metro stop and McGill University  The staff and everyone in Montreal were noticeably very friendly and polite  The rooms are nice with large bathrooms with Swiss Institute toiletries and fluffy bathrobes  The health club is large and nicely equipped  The hotel can provide gym clothes and shoes  We were upgraded to a premium twin on the top floor of the hotel and had a great view of the city  Recommend signing up for the Omni Select Guest Program before your stay  Then you can get free coffee and orange juice every morning delivered to your room  be our membership was a factor in getting upgraded to a room on the st floor  Recommend Chez Cora for breakfast  A location is a couple blocks away near on Rue Stanley  Chez Cora is a reasonably priced popular Montreal breakfast spot   Bring comfortable shoes you will walk a lot

P => hotel park avenue i was with some friends while we had our easter holiday on montreal and since we were looking for a cheaper hotel    Hotel Park Avenue is the place to go    youll have a bed to sleep in the night since most of the day we were in the town   close to the bus station so you have the access to the city   
P => One star is one too many My husband and I were spending a couple of nights in Montreal and were just looking for a room to sleep in nothing fancy  I was hoping just for a clean simple room in a relatively good location  Unfortunately this hotel came nowhere near our low expectations  It was quite disgusting  The air conditioning in first room we were given wasnt working so they offered us another room where the air conditioning did work but it was very loud  The window looked onto a dark very small courtyard  The room was dirty literally crumbs and garbage on the nightstand hairs on the sheets  The bathroom was so small that you had to stand sideways in the shower or else your shoulders would touch the wall and shower curtain and Im a small woman  The toilet area was so narrow there was no room for a toilet paper holder so the roll was just placed on the back of the toilet tank  I didnt like to take my shoes off for fear of what might be on the carpet  We tried the fan once but it shook so much I thought it was going to fly off the ceiling and land on the bed  We put the quotplease clean the roomquot sign on the room one day when leaving at AM and when we came back at  PM it hadnt been made up  So we asked the front desk and they gave us new towels but that was it  The explanation was that they only had one housekeeper so they hadnt gotten to our room yet at  PM Overall the location was pretty good for what we wanted but I would absolutely not stay there again  It came out to  a night and wasnt worth half that  
P => Hotel of Horrors Giving this place one star is being optimistic  From the moment I entered the hotel room I knew my stay was not going to be easy  Upon first inspection I noticed that the carpet was not vacuumed and the futon was covered in crumbs  Further inspection revealed a lampshade with blood on it hair on the bedsheets and a ceiling fan that wobbled so much that leaving it on would be a safety hazard  In the bathroom there wasnt any soap and the toilet paper roll was almost empty  Also when the shower was turned on it would spray all over the bathroom  One of my roommates asked the front desk for more sheets but they didnt have any  The only sheet she had to sleep on had a huge mysterious black stain on it  Also there is no parking at this hotel which is a huge hassle if you are unfamiliar with the city and dont understand very much French  Needless to say stay somewhere else  Spend the extra money and book at a higher quality hotel down the street  No one should have to sleep in a hotel room that looks like a CSI crime scene  Sure this hotel is cheap but you definitely get what you pay for 
P =>  star hotel Hopeful My boyfriend and I made the mistake of staying here  The one star rating is rather hopeful two thirds of a star would be more like it Apart from the fact that the front doors keycode never worked all weekend the chair stuck quotArtfullyquot in the hallway the red paint on the power jacks the thermostat hanging off of the wall the suspicious stains in the bathroom the sink in the main room with no pipes and the pre ripped towels this is the perfect quotNo frillsquot experience for the weary traveler  The only positive   the beds were firm and the sheets though smelling strongly of bleach were clean I would not recommend this to anyone unless youre really really really really really desperate and have no where else to go  
P => run away other than the wires hanging from the sockets the lamp that didnt light a bathroom with the sink hanging over the toilet and my ATM card that went missing there this was a fine place  
P => adorable little hotel This hotel impressed me very much  Its small quiet secure clean and overall almost perfect The personel was very polite and helpfull Excellent for any kind of trip  
P => Ideal for Students I stayed at the Hotel Parc Avenue for a whole month in y    I was to do a year of studying in Montr al preceded by an Intensive French Language course which lasted a month  Unfortunately I booked the university residences too late but was offered this hotel by quotLa Maison Internationale de Montrealquot who deal in accommodation mainly for students Anyway to cut to the chase   I found this hotel ideal   especially considering that I only paid about  CAD a night The rooms were a ent size complete with a small refigerator and dish washing type sink with overhead cupboards a Combi Cable TVRadio bizarre I know a lounge type chair a desk chair and desk and Air Conditioning  The bathroom was basic but clean towels and face cloths were provided and changed every day Downstairs on the same floor as reception there is a small but useful kitchen no pans provided although there were cooking implements ice machine and outdoor k Because of my long stay and because I booked through LAMIMO I had the use of the clothes washing facilities in the basement free of charge all I had to do was bring my own powder and softner   Laundry could only be done in the evenings though because housekeeping used them during the day for the hotel linen My only real problem was with the obviously antique AC system   mine leaked all over the floor for some reason despite the temperature being set above the quotdangerquot level for the AC system  I was then moved to another room     with another AC that proceeded to do the same but not too bad thankfullyRight next to the hotel there is a Dairy Queen and McDonalds over the road there is a service station with chips and the like but also an AampW   minutes down Mont Royal one will find a Provigo superch  various caf s an SAQ Soci t  des Alcools de Qu bec the chain of government owned liquor stores minutes away one will find the Mont Royal Metro however frequent buses for downtown leave from right outside the hotel If you can put up with a one star hotel then go for the Hotel Parc Avenue you basically get what you pay for  I found the hotel well situated with basic facilities and a really attractive price 
P => Keep away from it  By far the worst hotel of our week in Canada Dirty room dirty sheets antique sanitation smelly And almost the most expensive of the week Forget about it  
P => A eviter  
P => MUY MAL HOTEL  
P => Pas cher mais pas terrible  
P => 
P => Nice Cheap Accomodation The hotel is fairly centrally located right next to a huge park and is clean  Beds are fine and the hotel certainly did the job  There is no parking at the hotel so you must park on the street which can be very tricky  We got a ticket which we were not happy about but cest la vie  All in all a good deal for the money nonetheless  
P => What you pay is even less than what you get Horrible service  Hotel is in the middle of nowhere  minutes walk to the closest metro station  Parking   fee is behing the hotel where there is grafitti all over the place  I asked the front desk for a refund after II checked in and guess what the lady said she couldnt refund anything not even the parking    I called the manager after my stay and same answer    Brutal service they dont care at all they just want to make money    Hope they wont have yours  Do be fooled by the pics the have on their website ask some of the back of the hotel  By the way I called Bonjour Quebec so they can relocate me to another hotel    
P => Good value in a fascinating district My family members have used this hotel several times but this was the first time I had stayed there  We knew about the parking and as the room rate was reasonable ided to splurge for the convenience I emailed the hotel to reserve it and had no problem they replied almost immediately and when we got there the receptionist knew all about it  One unexpected charge was night for our fifteen year old to stay with us The hotel room had two queen size beds which were comfortable the room was a good size so we didnt feel cramped though the bathroom is small  The interior of the room seemed in good condition though there was some peeling paint in bathroom  The hallways were a bit shabby  Most of the time we didnt hear much noise as the window air conditioner while not really loud set up enough of a background to drown out most outside noise  I did notice people in other rooms moving around early in the morning  There were no extras no iron hairdryer coffeemaker etc and I noticed that there was no waste bin in the room just in the bathroom  The shower was excellent lots of hot water though The breakfast that was included was just cereal croissants toast and jampeanut butter and coffee or tea  Enough for a quick start but not for a nice start to the day The main advantage of this hotel is if you want to explore the Plateau district  It is a multi ethnic and quite trendy area with lots of restaurants bars and interesting shopping  One evening we watched people practicing their tango dancing outside in one of the little squares that can be found in the area  On the other side is Mount Royal Park with a steep climb up the mountain or you can drive  
P => Clean hotel in fun neighborhood This hotel is very clean and is located in a really fun area of montreal  You should note that this hotel is a walk up and has  floors of rooms   so be prepared to walk up the stairs with your luggage  If possible request a room facing the back of the building it is much quieter and peaceful  The bathrooms are a little small but they are clean and modern  The shower is really good and they have plenty of hot water  The breakfast consists of some cereal and a carton of milk in a basement room that is not very welcoming  We skipped it The location of the hotel is in the plateau district of montreal  This is not a touristy area but there are many restaurants cafes and local hangouts to try out  It is also located a  block from the entrance to Mount Royal which is a wonderful park to walk or to jog in  The downtown area is a   minute walk from the hotel but there is bus service on parc avenue that takes you to downtown The hotel only has  parking spots night that you need to reserve ahead of time  We easily found free street parking for the weekend on the blocks surrounding the hotel specifically on De Lesplanade  Overall we were very satisfied with our stay and would recommend this budget hotel  
P => Great little hotel I had read good reviews and done a lot of research on hotels in Montreal before a trip up there and this one came out on top as far as price through Expedia and customer reviews through rd party travel sites  Yes there isnt an elevator but Americans are too fat anyway and could stand to take the stairs once in a while  But you can walk and get to a great deal of attractions cabs if youre willing to pay the fare can get you most anyplace else in the area in under  min and there are usually places to park on the streets although they are mostly metered  The hotel staff went above amp beyond all of the front desk personnel we met were very friendly and extremely helpful  They made our trip better by being able to point out places to go and how to get there  They were also responsive to some complaints we had about noise  unfortunately the walls are thin so you can hear what is going on around you if other occupants are being loud  Bathroom is small but wasnt really a big deal to us  it was kept clean and new towels arrived daily without fail  I will stay there again for sure when we go back for another all girls vacation  
P => Terrible Experiencie   Stay Away This was the worse hotel Ive ever stayed in my life Far from all the attractions in a college area  Close to Mount Royal But still too far  When I first arrive with my husband the lady with red hair  very rude and nasty took my CC and already charge me for my full staying   I understand thats their service but I just HATE this type of service I think its really rude do this to a customer and with my hotels experience with  countries Ive never seen this    and the worse    when we were leaving the hotel the same woman was arguing with somebody on the phone really loudGossiping at work hours while she was arguing we were waiting for hour taxi for our final destination back home  She said that hour taxi was in the way and continued arguing on the phone  my husband and I got discusted by terrible customer service  The only one nice there was the arabe guy he was very nice and kind booking the taxi for us but hes there just at night during the day is the lady whos very unprofessional  The rooms was OK the shower too you get what to you pay for  But the hotel would be more appreciate if they have people more professional during the day I dont recomend this hotel to anybody  Its very hard when you get upset when you are looking for a good time out of home  
P => Try it youll be pleasantly surprised  I travel quite often but when I travel with my family I pay more than I care to and stay in a  star hotel  This time I stayed one night sans family and gambled on the Plateau Royal  What a nice surprise The hotel was immaculate the bed comfortable and garet the service desk clerk guided me to a free parking space  The one drawback is its distance from the Metro about a  minute walk down Ave Mont Royal  On the flip side its literally across the dtreet from Parc Mont Royal the gem of Montreals parks and arguably the site of Montreals best views  And the Plateau offers a variety of eateries and entertainment venues  If you stay here grab a breakfast at Rustys a local indtitution and a great place to eat for cheap  
P => Perfect Weekend Stay I stayed at Hotel Plateau Royale for a weekend Friday to Monday with my boyfriend  I searched for hours on the internet for the seemingly impossible combination of a great deal good location and comfortable yet simple accommodations  Finally I came across this hotel and it completely lived up to my expectations even exceeded them In ruary Montreal is rather cold and this weekend it even snowed a few inches but we got an amazing nightly rate  We spent three nights at about  American dollars per night for a big room with a king size bed private bathroom and free wireless internet    thats insane Staff are very very friendly  Housekeeping probably thought we were so annoying as we were never out of the room when they came by  But on return to the room in the evening   fresh towels were there  The woman who checked us in had great energy and answered all of my questions  I was so nervous that be our reservations were not received or that they would stick us in some gross tiny room with no windows and a single bed  Not the case at allEverything went so smoothly our room was exactly what we wanted  King size bed was very comfortable and Im picky about beds  I liked the little chairs set up near the window  I generally hate hotels especially huge commercial ones but my boyfriend felt uneasy about a bedampbreakfast type accommodation for this trip   Hotel Plateau Royale is the perfect happy medium  Its relatively small and homey welcoming informal and intimate but we still had a satisfying sense of anonymity and simplicity We actually spent a lot of time downtown as we were visiting friends and doing specific activities there  The weather was at times frigid and parking short term although in warmer months the hotel has parking available at a fee so we drove to most local destinations in better conditions this hotel seems a nice walk to rue Ste Catherine  But we did find a cute and relatively inexpensive local bar on Avenue du Mont Royal Est called Le Boudoir nice local art and free used books  as well as some nice shops and coffee spots  I hate feeling too touristy and this hotel is within a cute somewhat trendy neighborhood that I wish we had had more time to explore ONLY minor quotdislikequot I would have liked a fridge to keep juice winebeer or minimal food items but only if we had stayed longer so we never asked about it  Towels a little scratchy for me but nothing horrible  
P => A nice budget hotel   big room free WLAN I suddenly got an inspiration to create a TripAdvisor account while I am still staying at hotel Plateau Royale Yes thats right the free WLAN actually works right now   Mbps connection strength excellent  As some of the earlier reviews said the hotel doesnt look too encouraging from outside but the room is very clean and huge  The room service works nicely the bed is huge and the staff has been friendly so far I am staying in Montreal for a workshop held at McGill University campus  The campus is about  kilometers away from the hotel but I like walking so thats not a problem  The hotel is just next to the mountainMt Royale Park I went there today for a walk  For those who like nature trees and parks this location  be a good choice  The hotel is a bit far away from the downtown area  The walk to nearest metro station takes about  minutes My room doesnt have a proper table to do work with a computer I am writing this from the bed  Theres one table which is too short and another one which is too tall the TV is placed on top of that one  This  be a problem if youre on a business trip  I need to edit myself some documents while my stay in here and its not very convenient without a proper writing table quotBreakfast includedquot  Yes true it is served in the restaurant on the opposite side of the street  But it was not mentioned anywhere that the breakfast price does not include neither taxes nor service fee  The breakfast includes two pieces of toast eggs and potatoes and a cup of tea or coffee  The value of the coupon that they give from reception is  Am I happy with this hotel selection and would I recommend my friend to go here Certainly yes The hotel is cheap its conveniently located next to the park and WLAN works quite nicely  
P => Surprisingly Great For a budget hotel this place is simply great  From the outside youll think you made a mistake booking this place  But for  a night we got a huge room with a huge king sized bed and a short walk from the lively cafes restaurants and bars of avenue du mont royal  Has much more character than one of the downtown hotel chains that will cost you over  a night  A great surprise But dont go for the views  
P => Pleasant bargain hotel near the centre of all the hub bub We booked this place because it was the cheapest and we were on a tight budget  When we first arrived we were greeted by an incredibly friendly staff member who went out of her way help us plan our bus routes and even gave us a free bus pass that another customer had dropped off earlier  The room was unusual shaped very long and narrow with a tiny bathroom two double beds and a little sitting area with some chairs and a table  There was also a door in the corner which opened to a sprial staircase that went God knows where   Im guessing it was an emergency exit but the staircase did not look like it handle the weight of half a normal person without collapsing  Our first impressions of the room were good  It was clean smelled like oranges   but it was freezing  We turned the thermastat up all the way but when we went over to the heater right under the window there was little coming out  On our way out for the day we stopped at the main counter to mention the heat issue and the owner rushed to our room to try and solve the problem  Upon returning that night the room was warmer   but still not too warm  Also when I went to go take a shower that night I realized that there was no warm water  The sinks faucet gave luke warm water sometimes but the tap in the tub stayed ice cold the whole time  I did not consider this a big deal at the time and so did not mention it to the staff  I regret this now as I could have possibly warned them of an underlying problem with the plumbing that  lead to the future ruin of the hotel and the owners family structure  In conclusion this hotel is great for the price  The staff are unusually helpful its located close to downtown and right at the bottom of Mont Royal the room are nice and clean   quiet too beds are comfy with even comfier pillows and the only downside is the lack of hot water which it didnt say IT HAD so I guess be I shouldnt expect it  Also ask about the supposedly offered quotfree breakfastquot because nothing was mentioned to us about it once we were at the hotel  
P => Great little hotel Spent three nights at the Plateau Royale Hotel  same address    rue du Parc  We loved it  It was inexpensive clean quiet and had a lovely king size bed with down duvet  Staff was pleasant and extremely helpful  The hotel is about a  minute walk north of downtown but that was expected  Lovely location near Mount Royal   could see the cross from our window 
P => Correct  
P => Facile   trouver et prix convenable  
P => 
P => Not so far off the beaten path My husband amp I stayed at Ruby Foos while visiting relatives in Montreal  It is off a major highway not located downtown or in Old Montreal but it is a very short walk to a metro stop  We were in one of the reated rooms and found it roomy and very comfortable  My husband who lived in Montreal until very recently was very impressed with Ruby Foos  One could pay much more for a similar hotel room nearer to the tourist attractions  If youre not timid about using the metro Ruby Foos can provide very comfortable accommodations at a very good price  
P => As long as you get a newly reated room     The newly remodeled king superior rooms in the hotels  storey wing are large and well furnished  Comfortable bed roomy bathroom nice touches throughout Large new lobby and very friendly and helpful front desk Prices seemed reasonable with free parking and convenient location beside the arie Expressway Most people staying here are on business in the area or visting friends and family in the nearby residential areas of Hampstead Cote St Luc or Snowdon  There are very few choices on this side of town The Metro is very close if you dont want to drive downtown and a few restaurants and fast food nearby  Across the street of course is that famous orange ball Gibeaus Orange ep worthy of a pilgrimage for those who like to recall life in the s  Still great hot dogs  fries and Orange ep  Great fun at night with the hot cars motorcycles etc Worth the  minute drive down arie and north of Queen y Rd is the venerable and excellent Snowdon Deli  Save yourself the drive down to Schwartzs on Boul St Laurent unless youve never been to Schwartzs in which case you have to go line up outside and experience it for yourself If youre in the mood for some fancy shopping without going downtown Ruby Foos is only about   minutes away from Rockland Shopping Centre  Get directions at the concierge  All the high end stores  
P => Great location for west Montreal We drove to Ruby Foos in less than  minutes in our rental car from Montreal airport  Parking is free and plentiful  The staff is very friendly and helpful  Our room on a non smoking floor in the remodelled section was large and nicely orated  It included flat screen TV fridge ironing board and iron and computer connections I didnt have a computer but there are a couple in the lobby which I used to surf the internet and print out boarding passes We had a couple of nice breakfasts in the restaurant but there are also Tim Hortons McDonalds and others within  blocks  It is also close to a Metro stop if you want to avoid taking the car downtown Our dhter stayed in the cheaper and older section  Her room was OK but the hallways and elevator need refreshing As most of our Montreal activities were on the west side of the Island the location was terrific  
P => You wont do better I am there every month on business with free parking amp internet fully reated rooms you can not do better for the price  If the weather is bad it is beside the metro so getting around is easy  The restaurants are good not great  But if you like Indian food the best in the city is at a litte family place around the corner  
P => Not as pictured    We booked a regular room with a Queen size bed on the non smoking floor  The hotel has a very nice lobby friendly service free parking but the room looks NOTHING like any of the pictures where the rooms look contemporary  asian fusion  The ones pictured are probably the higher end rooms and the pictures are QUITE eiving  The room smelled a little smoky the bed was SMALLER than a current standard Queen sized bed  When I inquired to make sure they had given us the right room they told us that the bed is older and more modern Queen sized beds are being built larger in this case they should have definitely advertised this room as having a double bed because it is smaller  I liked the convenience of having a small fridge in the room but I did not like the fact that there was no cold water running from the bathroom tap  I had to brush my teeth with hot water    
P => Excellent Hotel Ive stayed at this place a few times and they recently reated  It looks like a completely different hotel The lobby is upgraded to a modern look  The rooms have been reated as well  Flat screen TV new carpets linens etc  The best feature      the sliding wall that covers the window you get complete black out to sleep at nightThe gym has all the amenities and they have a heated outdoor pool The restaurant is new its a sushi bar and looks fantastic Free parking walking distance to restaurants and shops Its close enough to the city without being in the middle of downtown I will definitely stay there again 
P => Reations are superb I ve stayed here about  times over the past  years  It was getting really run down until recently when they made reations  I just stayed here tember th and was pleasantly surprised with the reated lobby and rooms  I don t think all the rooms are reated but definitely request to stay in one  It kind of reminded me of a small Vegas hotel room  Very nice asian inspired d cor  One thing I loved was the  curtains   Instead of curtains there is a sliding wall which perfectly blocks out the sun if you want to sleep in  Also if you aren t staying downtown this is a perfect location   minute walk to the metro  I ate lunch caf  DLux which was very good  However I attended a private party in the same restaurant that evening for  people and the food served was not too good  Dry chicken and very fishy salmon  
P => Good value I have been staying at Ruby Foos for many years  I am an ex Montrealer living in Ottawa and I literally have lost count the number of times Ive stayed at the property  The hotel is clean modern and recently reated  It is very conveniently situated in mid town about  minutes from downtown not in rush hour  There are excellent restaurants nearby  Parking is free and plentiful  On the other hand it is NOT downtown and is not close to any tourist sights  That said my trips to Montreal are to visit family who live in the immediate area  I hardly ever go downtown  If the prime purpose of your trip to Montreal is to sightseeing it is inconveniently located  You would be much better downtown  
P => A Winner I must say that after reading some of the reviews before the reation I was reluctant to book at this hotel  Because of the great location and free parking   I took a chance and reserved a room anyway  What a great ision First impression the lobby is rekable  Check in was efficient and fast  My beautifully reated room was impeccable and I m very picky  Staff is courteous and really helpful  And the recently opened new restaurant was great   a fitting re launch of Montreal s famous Ruby Foo s restaurant  
P => Great boutique hotel   vastly underrated I booked a stay at Ruby Foos entirely for the convenience its on arie just a few blocks from Hwy  so its perfect if you need to get around Montreal quickly or get out of town But I ended up being extremely impressed by the hotel itself  Its just finishing up a top to bottom reation and the rooms and facilities are uniformly excellent  My room had an super comfortable king size bed a spotless good sized bathroom a large flat screen TV excellent lighting and a comfortable work space  The rooms were clearly intelligently designed even the light switches are in all the right places The lobby is clean and spacious there is lots of free parking though it is outdoors and the staff are uniformly friendly and helpful There are a few touches that would put Ruby Foos over the top a phone by the bed would be nice and Im told wireless internet is coming soon  For now an Ethernet cable is provided  It worked well for me but I prefer to be able to choose where I work on my laptop Finally the only sign of amateurish service was over breakfast  The waitstaff appeared to be poorly trained slow and a bit clueless  Some days it took ten minutes for them to take our order refills were inconsistent and the one time my colleague wanted to send something back the waiter picked an argument with him Overall though our stay at Ruby Foos was exceptional and I would gladly come back  
P => Great place to stay Ruby Foos is highly underrated  Although the hotel is undergoing a massive reation which will be done in  months according to certain staff members it did not affect my stay in the least  The room I stayed in on the th floor of the main hotel was one of the new deluxe rooms  Everything was as advertised it was very comfortable and tastefully appointed  Very zen  The housekeeper that took care of this area was extremely good at her job and very helpful  I ordered room service twice for breakfast and once for a late dinner from La Tulipe Noire the food was very good and the graciousness and promptness of service was well above the norm  Once the reations are complete Ruby Foos will be a hotel to reckon with  Ive been coming to Montreal since the late s  I usually stay with family or downtown  Now however if I cant stay with family I will stay at Ruby Foos  I highly recommend this hotel for its convenience to Downtownmins  and the Airportmins  its affordability paid  US per night and comfort HN New Jersey USA 
P => nice very accomodating The staff at this Hotel confused my reservation it took me about  minutes to get check inI was given a room that was hot and smelly the furniture was quite ancient lookingafter that I checked out of that hotel  when i asked for a refund they just looked at me in disgracethere i was searching for a place to stay in a city i didnt know I found the Quality Midtown  the staff and amenities were quite nice  
P => Ruby Blues   Cant Recommend I left my booking for my last trip to Montreal up to a business partner who followed the advice of a local company which had a corporate rate at Ruby Foos  I was rather optimistic about my stay here because Montreal has a fine reputation for smaller less well known hotels offering high levels of comfort and service  I was under the impression that the Ruby would fall into the boutique hotel mold however I was sorely mistaken  The hotel is quite simply an average    The rooms were outdated the beds were uncomfortable and the service was unfriendly The area has an industrial feel to it and is unsuitable for nightly walks or shopping  We did try the Sushi restaurant one evening and found that the food and service lived up to the general quality level of the hotel which was not great The one upside is that the hotel has a great breakfast restaurant and the service was quite good  My food in the morning almost made me forget about my sub par room experience the evening prior The only reason to stay here is if you are doing business at a local company and require a hotel that is close for an early morning meeting  Otherwise I would suggest another option especially if you have good taste and appreciate   hotels that live up to their ratings riott  
P =>  Star Hotel We stayed at the hotel for one night as we were attending a family function just down the road at  The Living Room  a great place for a wedding The service at check in was excellent  We were greeted in English and made to feel at home  The location was perfect for us because it is right off Highway  and close to the function we were attending  There is also a Metro station within walking distance  We received a group rate of CDN which I thought was very reasonable for a big city with free parking and free internet access The hotel itself feels like it is stuck in the sixties  It is very dated and worn  The rooms are typical hotel rooms with the beds a TV a work desk and a regular size bathroom  Again the d cor is dated but it was clean and beds were comfortable  The downside with the beds was that they a full size not queens  We needed an extra fold up cot to accommodate our family of  two adults and two teenagers There was an outdoor pool obviously closed in ember and a small work out facility that appeared fine  One nice find was that there is a barbershop in the lobby  My son got a great haircut and the barbers were great  The other recommendation I have is to try the pastry at the restaurant connected to the hotel  Top of the line fresh baked Overall we had a good  average experience  Nothing fancy but a clean place to sleep for the night  If you need to be in the area its an ok place to stay  
P => I wouldnt even take a professional escort here  No service no refund I am not picky but this is the last time I book at a non brand hotel  I usually try to stay downtown but my friend told me that Ruby Foo is reasonable  I gave it a try and will not be going back  I was checked into a room that was already occupied and then when I told the front desk they asked me for my ID They then checked me into the wrong room type and refused to give me and my friend two beds  We got  king for two  year old men I woudnt have minded if the room didnt have the childrens desk  I felt like I was in Viet Nam  during the war  The party in the hallway kept me up most the night and in the morning we missed our wake up call becasue the phone was unplugged so my buddy missed his  AM flight at Pierre Elloitt Airport  The front desk guy didnt even say sorry when I asked for a rebate or refund  He said speak with the manager and transferred me to voicemail  I checked into the Sheraton on Cote de Liesse but they were soldout the next night  I then moved to the Quality on arie and they were both fine  I was seriously disappointed at Ruby Foo  
P => terrible hotel didnt end up staying at this hotel  I had heard good things aobut it and thought it was rated  stars  Definitely not  I would give it  stars  Rooms were barren basic ac didnt work well and room looked unclean  I found manager unhelpful and some of the staff rude  We ended up not staying and went to Sheraton Airport  Although that hotel was a bit out of the way staff there were wonderful rooms were great and kids loved their waterslide  Ruby Foos would not be my choice for a hotel to stay at if you want to throughly enjoy the holiday  Sheraton was  cheaper and had an indoor pool with waterslide  Ruby Foos   overpriced staff rude rooms very basic and not exceptionally clean  Forget the convenience and stay elsewhere  The or dark and weird   long halls to walk especially with children  
P => Perfectly ent Basic Hotel I stayed there in early e   The hotel in my view is a perfectly fine average  star hotel  No bells and whistles or anything special about it but its clean and relatively up to date  A bonus at least for me was the free parking with unlimited in and out priveleges  Its also right near the arie Expressway which allows for getting in or leaving the city painlessly  My room was spacious plain and quite clean and had been refreshed not that long ago  The bed and furniture were just fine  Unlike one of the previous reviews there was nothing old dirty saggy or noisy about the place at all  Check in and check out were quick and painless Overall a fine basic clean hotel  
P => Group Trip I was here with a group and developed a medical problem  The front desk was very helpful to us  They let me borrow their wheelchair for the trip and found a place where we could buy some crutches  The service was a little slow for breakfast if you are in a hurry  The rooms were clean  
P => Its not  that  bad I had pretty low expectations based on these reviews but it s really a ent hotel  The fact is its the closest hotel with free parking to downtown  min drive at budget price  This is good if you have a car  Otherwise look closer downtown  With regards to quotDirty furniturequot quotsaggy bedquot quotrunny toiletquot quothot roomquot    these claims are unfounded in my experience  With regards to quotdated lookquot and quotno update since the squot also seem unfounded  The bathroom is totally updated the contents of hotel room looked early s    its totally on par with any hotel in this price range I ve been in in the upper Midwest US or southern US within the last year  If you want a class I suggest you increase your budget and find something downtown  
P => Excellent Location service and dining I do not see what people do not like about this place  We have been staying here for at least   years and the place is great  Just make sure to ask for a room in the newer wing  The or is asian themed and there is a restaurant on premises which serves several types of food in  dining room  Location is great since it is close to main roads and the metro subway system  Rooms are always clean and made up by the time you get back in the afternoon  Stay here if you want easy access to the city  Do not stay if you except luxury and pampering  Front desk staff go out of their way to help you including researching restaurants and attractions in the area  
P => Very Dated s This Hotelshould be Motel is way overpriced for the poor condition that the place is in Our room had a double bed that was worn outsaggy and lumpy The toilet ran on all the time It looked like it hadnt been updated since the s  Teenagers were running up and down the halls late at night making noise Staff didnt keep a close enough eye on them after complaints  Restaurant was okay but overpriced I cant believe that the CAA recommended them This was based on my visit in  Its obvious from the more updated comments that nothing has changed and the owners dont care about making the place nice enough to justify the price they are charging  Needless to saythe next time Im in MontrealI wont be staying there  
P => Hotel Ruby Foos Recently stayed at this hotel  The rooms were recently reorated and are quite lovely  Hotel staff was friendly and helpful The area has developped recently with many restaurants and shopping outlets  A major bonus is that the parking is free and you can take the subway to downtown Montreal  Way cheaper than paying for downtown parking A beautiful new spa and fully equipped gym are on site in the hotel  I must have gained  pounds eating at one of the restaurants La Tulipe Noire The cheesecake and pastries are to die for If you enjoy sushi you have found the ideal spot This hotel is really convenient because of its location close to Airport and downtown  A real treasure All in all I would denifitely return to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who is looking good quality versus value  
P => Hotel Ruby Foo ProsCheap place to stay Close to Metro Close to Dorval AirportConsNothing cool is in walking distance Restaurant food quality for everything except sushi is horrible  Restaurant service particularly the bar is not existent  On a week night expect to have to harass the hotel to keep the bar open past  PM  Last call in Montreal is btwn  and  AM  Condition of rooms is VERY poor  Fortunate are or is very dated  Thermostat in your room  or  not work it goes for the taps in the bathroom Have never stayed at such a poor quality hotel Would choose a best western over this place any day  
P => 
P => Would recommend I stayed at this hotel in t    I would recommend this hotel  The surrounding area and hotel itself seems un appealing on first appearance but improves as time goes by  The hotel is an older building and the hallways and tiny elevator look somewhat shabby  However the room itself is very clean  The bed is pretty comfortable  They have hardwood floors When I arrived there was no remote control for the TV and the reception desk said I would have to wait till the next day for them to get one set up They provide a free wireless internet connection that s fairly quick The rate included breakfast  The hotel gives you a card for breakfast at the restaurant next door Pacini  The breakfast option consisted of either  eggs with baconhamsausage or yogurt with fruit  The restaurant has an all you can eat bread bar with super delicious jams The location is excellent  It s about a  minute walk to Old Montreal  It s a few steps away from a subway station  It s also within walking distance to all the restaurants on Rue St  Denis  Highly recommend iette et Chocolat esp  if you are a chocolate loverParking costs night  
P => Economy Room Clean quiet and comfy bed but tiny room  Economy room runs about  and is super small Theres barely room to walk around the bed or even stretch our your arms in the bathroom or shower good luck finding space to open up the ironing board or finding space to set the coffee maker  However the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was the most comfy that I have ever experienced in a hotel room Window unit air conditioner was noisy but worked well bathroom exhaust fan was broken and hardly worked at all  Basic TV has a modest selection of channels  This room is overall fine for a solo traveler but would be tight for two  Peacefully quiet my room was not facing the street  The staff were courteous and helpful  This is a great location for those who want easy access to a multi line metro station just  short blocks away and easy short walk to Latin Quarter Old Town and gay village  This is a perfectly fine hotel for the no frills budget traveler who is looking for a clean quiet retreat for a moment and plans to spend the majority of time out seeing the sites  
P => Totally overrated place  Romantics stand back I chose this hotel based on the raving reviews    I absolutely cant understand why people are so excited about this place  The front desk is ok polite but I wont say friendly  The corridors and the carpet are really in bad shape and not engaging at all  My room was terrible very small no bed light only a ceiling yellow light ugly courtyard view and the bathroom closet size has a air system so noisy that you want to get out asap  Very clean however  And free wifi appreciate But in general this hotel is a perfect illustration of what the words anti glamour means  
P => Great location and excellent value I chose this hotel after reading the reviews and was quite pleased  Hotel is right between Latin Quarter and Old Montreal perfect for walking and subway very close by  The front desk is so helpful  The room was spotless quiet comfy bed lots of pillows and updated bathroom  Parking garage right around the corner and no need for the car you can walk or ride the subway  Loads of restaurants safe neighborhood  
P => Great location but not much else     We spent  nights at this hotel based on the reviews of trip advisors  We were looking for a good location in the middle of the quartier latin to give us a feel of urban life in Montreal and Hotel St Denis did in fact deliver this  Univ of Quebec at Montreal is right across the street  Rue St Catherine is one block away and it is full of life and has everything you can imagine park church grocery store pharmacy eateries pubs and many more     The subway station is also just a  minute walk    Our teenager just loved the whole urban scene  Other than the location I thought St  Denis was just an average place  The bldg is old and it looks like there was some recent remodeling done  The beds were firm and comfy and the bathroom was laid out weirdly but clean  The Air Cond was loud but we were so exhausted from exploring the city all day that we werent too bothered  When it turned cool in the morning my husband turned off the AC and thats when we realized how loud it was  Our room window looked right into someone else window so we have the drape partially closed during the little time we were in the room  
P => Once again it was perfect  We went to Hotel St Denis again this year and were pleasantly surprised by the new wood floor they put in the room  It is a a nice touch The location is obviously excellent and the staff that was working on this particular week end wass joyfull and ready to help  They even lend us an umbrella for the night  For sure we will be back this year  
P => Small hotel located in busy area Hotel St Denis is an old building which was reated  Therefore our room was pretty small as well as the bathroom  The hallways looked pretty dated but the bedroom was ok  It was clean and comfortable despite the size  The staff was really friendly and the hotel offered free wireless internet The only really bad thing is that the street was really busy even at night and the air conditioning was too noisy  
P => Perfect Location but very outdated Hotel St Denis is the next street over from the Greyhound Bus Station and a  min walk to the metro station  In fact you can actually walk right into the city centre and all the pubs and restaurants in  mins so it is great location wise  It is very cheap especially given that we were there during the Jazz Festvial  The rooms are very small with the en suite barely being big enough to turn around in and you can still smell stale smoke even though we were in a non smoking room  It is clean enough and theres an ice machine in the hall with a nice little cafe downstairs and free wi fi throughout the hotel  All in all I would stay here again because the location is perfect and the price is very reasonable   i can put up with the small room and outdated or for the location and price offered in this european style hotel  
P => Location Location Location My Husband and I wanted to go away for our anniversary without stepping on a plane so off in the car to Montreal  We had a package deal for two nights that included parking and one breakfast  It was WELL worth it true there are no fancy soaps and shampoos but our room was large and CLEAN we barely heard a peep from any of the other guests  This being our first trip to Montreal the location was fabulous we were walking distance from the old port and were right in the latin quarter  The two restaurants on either side of the hotel are great too  Staff was friendly and helpful  
P => modest perfection Hotel St  Denis is not a fancy pants place  It is simple and understated  But the location is very central and would really suit a traveller who doesnt want to be in the commercial centre at a big Hilton or in a similar major chain hotel  The rooms are very clean and tastefully orated  Wonderful wooden   not carpeted   floors  It is comfortable cozy quiet and its easy to get anywhere in Montreal from here especially Old Montreal but also the major museums and the University and the many shops restaurants cafes bars and neighbourhoods nearby Im in a room with a king size bed   extremely good mattress   and Im appreciating the free wifi and the big enough TV  Extremely good value and Id stay here again for sure 
P => A Great Place to Stay St  Denis is in the heart of the Latin Quarter which is the heart of Montreal  The St  Denis is probably one of the best values  Its not opulent but impeccably clean with great service  Right next to a Bixi bicycle rental station of which there are  throughout Montreal and the best way to see the city  
P => excellent locationclean hotel   TINY bathroom but big room Stayed in the Hotel St denis for  night at the end of   The location is second to none right in the middle of all the actionbarsamprestaurantsclubssightseeingmetrobus station  Rue St Denis is mainly the french speaking going out area which I loved lots of jazz clubstrendy bars and really laid back  Very safe area and we never saw any trouble even walking home at amWe got a very reasonable rate of  a night plus tax online and from the reviews on TA we knew the rooms  not be the best out therebut for the price they were fine they were bang on  Let me say the bed was the comfiest ive ever slept onwith crisp white sheets  Large TV desk and chair wooden floors in the room which i liked instead of carpet only problem was the bathroomit was seriously tiny If you stand in the middle and stretch out your arms you can touch either side The shower left just enough room to stand in it good powerful shower tho The bathroom so small they had the sink out in the main room which looked quite odd and there were no shelves to put any toiletries    all minor quibbles but this is a review after all The whole hotel was spotlessly clean the staff were friendly and helpful there was good free wireless internet and the location was perfect    I would recommned this to a friend 
P => Great value for money  Ideal location Nice hotel in the latin Quarter close to subway and short walk to old Montreal  Also very close to the Mont Royal Plateau  
P => Love this place My husband and I frequently visit Montreal both for personal and business reasons and as a result have stayed at many different hotels throughout the city  Hotel St Denis is the one hotel which has consistently provided us with clean spacious rooms attentive and courteous staff and very reasonable rates  The fact that this hotel is centrally located is literally surrounded by quality restaurants and within minutes of the metro is only a bonus 
P => Second time here Love it This hotel is in a perfect location and it had everything we needed  This was my second time here and both times I had a very pleasant stay  I booked the budget room a smaller room but we were just sleeping in it so the size of it didnt matter  This room also had a mini fridge which was great for keeping water and beer cold  It looked as if our room on the second floor was just redone  It had nice very clean hardwood floor and new shower and tile  I would have to say that the bed is the most comfortable one that I have ever slept on  The bathroom is quite small in the budget room with no bath tub but it was suitable  Our room was facing St Denis street and even with the window cracked at night we didnt wake up due to noise outside  The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful they answered all of our questions and directed us to montreals quothot spotsquot  The hotel rooms come with free wifi interent you just need to ask the front desk for the code and they can give it to you  Parking is right around the corner with a secure garage with video survalliance for  Cad  a day which is not too bad for parking in the city  Overall this hotel is great  I have read the bad reviews and I just think that those people are expecting much more than what they are paying for this isnt the Hilton it is a cute well kept very clean hotel in the heart of montreal  
P => Delightful Cute and Clean hotel in a great location I booked this hotel on Expedia for only  a night   i wasnt expecting much at this price but I was pleasantly shocked  The receptionist was very pleasant the room smelled as if had just been reated that new construction smell the facilities were clean and new looking and it had the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on  I did not want to leave this hotel  The only small drawbacks are that the internet was very slow and that the building itself is old and the heating is centrally controlled so my boyfriend was too hot one night and was told the only way to make the room cooler was to open the window a crack  Otherwise I cannot speak highly enough of this small great value hotel  Very centrally located  close to pretty much everything as well as a central Metro stop  I was able to walk here from the bus station in about  mins  Also the cafe attached to the hotel has good food amazing desserts and is reasonably priced  And you dont have to go out in the freezing weather to enter it Also our room facing an interior courtyard was extremely quiet   I dont know about rooms facing the street  
P => Best rest spot in a hectic city My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for  days  We just landed from JFK after staying there for  days in a  star hotel where there was no place in the room for  suitcases  We discovered upon arrival a spacious room and a ent bathroom with a bathtub  The room was clean and they made sure it stayed this way for the whole stay  One thing I carry around in my travels my pillow  Needless to say i left it in my suitcase after I discovered their pillows  I must say this hotel was exaclty what we needed a resting place after a long day of wandering in the city  And we were there for the Jazz festival wich was just around the corner  Excellent location and for a very affordable price compared to New York or even other  star hotels in Montreal  
P =>  High price for such a bad service   My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night  The room we booked was the Budget room for   tax  Parking and breakfast were not included so we paid  dollars extra for parking  We ended up paying  for staying one night  The room and bathroom were very small and damp however they were clean  I wont recommend this hotel to my friends  You can find better hotels with the same price and much better service  
P => Good location Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for one week while visiting our friend in Montr al  We mainly chose this hotel because our friend lives in the next street so it was convenient to stay at this location  The location is excellent only a few minute walk to a big metro station very close to Chinatown St Catherine street shopping restaurants    and the St Denis street has a lot of restaurants and shops also The beds were comfortable and the room was clean and comfortable in size  The air conditioning was a bit loud and there came a bad smell when we turned it on so we just had the window open Theres a nightclub close by at the St Denis street so in the weekend there was a bit of a noise from the street  Also in the morning around  there was a cleaning truck or something like that on the street that made a bit of noise but nothing horrible  Just normal big city life noise I would say If youre looking for a basic clean room at a good location then this is a good choise  
P => Amazing Location My girlfriend and I had taken the greyhound bus from Toronto and the hotel was walking distance from the Greyhound station and the Metro station  The hotel was very nice and cozy and the staff was very helpful  We got a regular room and it was very clean and a ent size also  The location is the most important thing about this hotel It is close to EVERYTHING and the street is very old fashioned and has a wonderful feeling to it  The rates were very reasonable also and the restaurant next door is amazing for any meal  Our first time in Montreal was an amazing experience and it will now become a yearly thing  I will definitely be going back to Hotel St  Denis 
P => Good Location My husband and I and some friends stayed here  night en route from the Super Aqua Club to Ottawa  The location was excellent to enjoy the Just For Lhs festival  The location is also excellent if you want to walk to Old Montreal Chinatown shopping on St  Catherine Street the restaurants in the Latin Quarter and the subway  The price was good for accomodations during the festival  The rooms are very basic and could use new carpets and a paint job however the bathrooms are extremely clean and the beds are comfortable  Amenities are very basic  Although the building is dated it did not have that old hotel musty smell  Some street noise could be heard in the early morning but the air conditioner could drown it out  The staff was friendly and helpful  I would stay here again during the festival however I would find the rooms a bit overpriced at other times in the year  
P => Sunny funny happy I was in Hotel St Denis last week end and im so happy with it that I ide to book again for my ust holiday Everybody were so nice and happy to help   The manager that was passing by on Sunday send me to a really fun happening call quotThe Pic Niksquot on the island  I had a blast The location of the hotel is also excellent to visit the city walking    The rooms were clean and cozy   It was a perfect trip 
P => Nice hotel    but not at night  Nice little hotel just the basics which was fine with me as that is all I look for when traveling frequent business traveler However I was disturbed by one aspect only one but so much so that I will never again go to this hotel or reccomend it to any work collegue or friend the rudeness and very unprofessional attitude of the night clerks there I stayed there for a little over a week or so and EACH TIME that I came back to my room lateat night after my meetings the man who was at the counter went out of his way to make me feel not at all welcomed there     Probably the full time night clerk    as I had the misfortune of crossing paths with him on four or five nights in a row though their week end night clerk was not exactly quotMr  Guest Servicequot either but still much better than the one I came across most often during my last two previous stays there The young man Nick  greeted me very coldly when he DID great me at all each time that I passed through the lobby and the few times that I asked him for directions ect he made it a point to let me know that I was quotbothering himquot by sighing and rolling his eyes and answering me in a very exasperated tone of voice    and on one of those occasions if he was not drunk on the job then he did a very good imitation of someone who was At first I thought that it somehow might be me  But after one on my encounters with him I got to talking with a couple who had walked in while I was trying to deal with him as we went up the elevator and they told me that he had been equally as rude to them the previous night     I do wish to stress that the day and evening people were much more curteous than he is but with my work schedule when I am out on business as it is I mainly had that night guy to deal with as opposed to Such a pity I have been going to the St Denis for a little over two years now and though this is the only bad aspect here and only recently at that like I have said I have been coming here for two years now and I had never had this kind of trouble before with any of the staff be it night or day  
P => Really good hotel My friends and I stayed at Hotel St  Denis in ch  and Im just getting around to writing a review now  It is very good value for money  I think we paid about  room per night  The rooms were clean well maintained and elegant  The location is in the heart of downtown Montreal  There is a lovely restaurant next door that serves a great breakfast  I would highly recommend it  
P => Love the location and price We had a wonderful stay at Hotel St  Denis  The location in the latin Quarter is unbeatable a close walk to all sorts of great restaurants museums and concert venues  And a hop skip and jump to the metroThe neighborhood is pretty nice and seemed relatively safe  Since it IS a city you might hear a lot of noise in the alleyways at night but overall nothing too terrible Parking for the hotel is around the corner and when we stayed the rate as  dollars a day at the garage not bad for the city Our room was clean and roomy and the front desk staff was very nice The hotel is right next to a cute little bareatery called Kilo which seems to have a young hip vibe and makes some great sandwiches I recommend the mango and chevre panini Also included in your Hotel stay are vouchers for breakfast at the neighboring eatery Pacini  Certainly beats your usual continental breakfast of stale bagels with your usual hotel stayOverall we would definitely stay here again the location and price and quality for your dollar are unbeatable  
P => Great Location Great Hotel We stayed here ch th and th for a weekend getaway  We booked  large rooms to accomodate our  person party  Each room had  queen beds and a sofa with a pull out bed  Because of a cancellation we didnt need to use the pull out bed but it seemed like it would be about the size of a double bed  The rooms were basic and very large  We were impressed with how much room there was with plenty of closet space for  people  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and quite acceptable Our experiences with the front desk staff were very good  They were extremely helpful and willing to answer any and all questions we had  The cleaning staff seemed thorough though we didnt use them in the room I stayed in because a member of our party was ill for most of the second day  A particular bright sport for us was cafebar attached to the hotel Kilo  They had delicious sandwiches and desserts and excellent drink specials from    for  beers for as little as   amazing deal compared to prices in normal bars in Montreal  The staff at the restaurant were very friendly and gave us good recommendations on where to go for a night out  We spent both early evenings here taking advantage of the nice atmosphere and prices Probably the best thing about the hotel is the location  Youre a couple minute walk from bars and restaurants about a  minute walk from Chinatown and about   to the heart of Old Montreal Overall I was very pleased with our experience with Hotel St Denis  The hotel isnt a destination in itself but it is definitely an exceptional base to explore Montreal at a reasonable price without sacrificing service  
P => Location Location Location We loved the location of this hotel  We were intown for a festival and were able to walk back and forth with ease  Along the walking route from the hotel mainly on the Rue St  Laurence was everything else we could need from great Indian food to good cheap pizza to shopping venues to fun local bars  Our room was clean and the housekeeping staff was thorough  Yes the hotel is old and things are worn and the budget rom is about the size of a walk in closet but if you arent going to be in your room much and dont need in room ammenities then the price is right  The hotel is in a colorful neighborhhod across the street from the University so it is likely you will run into local characters which could include prostitutes and homeless persons but for us the local flavor and atmosphere only enhanced the experience  Great for folks like us on a tight budget great location friendly folks and very secure inside  
P => Really good trip Nice staff I was in Montreal last week end and the trip was excellent  The room was clean and calm  The staff was professional and they were going out of their way to help us with finding restaurants and attractions  Yes the hotel is located downtown with all the starnge people on the street but as soon as we pass the doors of the hotel    Everything is peaceful and confortable For sure i will be back in this hotel  
P => Excellent value for money We loved this hotel  It is wonderfully convenient and in easy walking distance of all of Montreals sights   you cant go wrong whichever direction you walk from the door  It was very clean and well appointed staff were friendly and the breakfast was excellent  Car parking was a little expensive but it is covered and secure which so close to the city centre is a real bonus  Our room was comfortable and immaculate  
P => Hotel St  Denis   Good value great location convenient to Metro  My fiance and I stayed at Hotel St  Denis on  to  in room  Things I liked Free Wireless Internet very helpful for planning the next day each night  Through travelocity I paid roughly night which is a great deal for the location of the hotel and the size of the rooms  Metro is a  minute walk from the hotel  Everyone was friendly and polite  Lots of cafes restaurants and boutiques are less than  minutes away on Rue St  Denis Dont stay here if you Want a bellhop to handle your bags Dislike homeless people  Expect a lavish room or room service Overall a great hotel experience exactly what I was looking for at a great price  
P => Great Value First time reservation for two nights prompted by positive reviews on TripAdvisor and excellent rate  Glad I did Central location made for quick walking jaunts to Old Montreal shopping on St  Catherine St  and visit to great variety of pubs and eateries on St  Denis St  The room was small but comfortable and very clean  Service was top notch   I called reception at am as hairdryer was missing from room     a new one was brought up in under  minutes  The food at Pacinis next door was terrific hotel included a full breakfast at Pacinis  Only minor complaint was a noisy air conditioner  I will definitely stay here again  
P => Great Value for Money Easily booked online and got confirmation the following day  Booked a single room with a king bed and got an upgrade to a room with jacuzzi  Front desk was friendly  Underground hotel parking was very close    for overnight parking  Also had free high speed internet that I didnt know about until we checked out  
P => Pretty good  Would stay again  Positives Great bed nice jacuzzi  Good price Negatives    Breakfast is NOT included  But its only  which is cheaper than getting it on your own     VERY noisy AC     No concierge services no money changingfew maps of the city available etc This is the perfect hotel if what you are looking for is a place to sleep after a day amp night of rocking in this extraordinary city  If youre looking for a st class experience stay somewhere else  
P => Hotel St Denis   Comfort  I stayed here   e nd while in town on business the business of tasting beer at the quotMondiale de Biere Festivalquot but that review is for another website  This well maintained hotel is located directly off the Latin Quarter and very close to the Berri UQAM Metro Station Look for the sign quotSortie rue St Denisquot and the Central Bus Station a stop for the Airport Shuttle   very convenient for me A problem free check in you can leave your bags until the room is ready led to a nice room big enough for anyone planning to spend their time visiting the city though plainly furnished a criteria never important to me  A whiff of fresh paint indicated recent reation  Note this reation did not include the bathroom plumbing let the shower run for a few minutes before stepping in or            brrrrrrrNext door to the left is Kilo a bistro with a wild wild entryway you will want to photograph while to the right is Pacini an attractive restaurant where guests belly up to a complimentary breakfast which includes the Bread Bar I recommend Hotel St Denis to anyone seeking convenience and comfort  All in all a wonderful place when in Montreal the money you save can be used to savor a few pints quotpintequot here of some delicious Quebec beer   Boreale Rousse for example  
P => Good Choice I would suggest this hotel if you are looking for one that is economical and in a convenient location  This is not a  or  star hotel but it is clean safe amp fairly priced I found the location to be good in terms of its proximity to the subway  about a block away amp on the same street  There was a restaurant next door which was good and a mini ket a few doors down  There were MANY restaurants and shops within walking distance  Parking was just around the corner   only  a day through the hotel The staff at the hotel were VERY helpful  They printed out maps amp directions upon request amp also promptly answered other requests  
P => Good Low End Hotel I was here on businesspleasure and stayed here for  nights and was overall very happy with the hotel  If you are like me and when you travel all a hotel is to you is a place to sleep and shower then you cant do much better that this for the price  Rooms were clean and the staff was helpful and the location is excellent as far as access to subway and downtown areas  One thing to be aware of is that there are some seedy areas around sex shops but they are not visable from the hotel or on the same street as the hotel  On the other hand since the hotel is close to the university and areas with lots of night life there are lots of late night eats open which is something I like  I checked in after midnight on the day I arrived and had no problem finding a place to eat after traveling all day Another thing to be aware of is if you have a room on the street and like to sleep in then it can get noisy  I found this out my first night and requested another room and they moved me to a room in the back which was much quieter  The elevators were down some of the time I was there but I always use the stairs anyway so this was no issue to me I was on th floor out of   The rooms did not have air conditioning so that might be an issue in the summer but I was very comfortable  
P => Great Location Great Food Great Service I enjoyed the location it is close to everything and once you start to walk about  miles out you end up in the middle of the city  The hotel has two great restrurants next to it and they are great  The services is great however the building is old and the carpet was old looking and the rooms are small  The beds where not that good but the services was impeccable I took my son with me and it was a bit uncomfortable for us  However two adults this is great  If you care a lot about the bed you  want to look at other places  Because my back hurted during my stay  However everything else was great  They are very clean and nice and everyone is smiling  I enjoyed the service and they made me feel comfortable If you are vacationing with children you should really consider the hotel and the little extras they can be priceless  However this hotel let me get in the city and also the local area and kind of better understand the life of the people there  It is not in the high tourist area but very close to it  So you get to see a lot  I think this place is great  i would return if I am on a budget beucase now I know what to except  But if I am to get better I will  
P => Perfect for those with a car budget and need to be near the subway My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel during the busy Labor Day weekend and found that this hotel was exactly what we were looking for   hour desk helpful employees who spoke English as well as French  The parking is around the corner and though a little sketchy we could take our car out as we pleased and return it later for a flat rate  Granted they charged us per day but it was reasonable for the city  The area around it is the Latin Quarter  there are good restaurants plenty of cafes and the subway was  block from our hotel  Were young in our mid twenties and the bed was comfortable the accommodations were simple and clean and we felt safe  The elevator is a little small but efficent and our room was very quiet  I will def  stay at this hotel again for the price cleanliness and  hour desk and parking 
P => Not what was advertised While this is rated as a  star it is more like a Quebec   star I booked through the Montreal tourist office absolutely fabulous service   always has been and they spotted a good price comparable to other  stars that included  full breakfasts When getting to the hotel I found out there were no breakfasts and there hadnt been for  months with the supplying kitchen closed   total   night was removed from the bill a token for two people and the inconvenience  They had not change their listings with the trourist office in this time and I would not have booked there if there was not some breakfast a basic expectation for small Montreal hotels and BampBs The restaurent beside the hotel opens late and closes early Otherwise desk help was friendly Parking is  per night in a garage near the hotel   OKThere is great value in Montreal in  and  stars not to have surprises 
P => Convenient location clean rooms great value Stayed at this hotel for  nights in my winter getaway in uary  Im glad I chose this hotel as it gave me the convenience and comfort that really made my Montreal experience from great to superb I like its location best as its literally around the corner  minute walk from the Berri UQAM metro station which connects both metro lines and you can get to all Downtoan and Plateau Mont Royal attractions in a single ride  It is connected to the Greyhound terminal which is also where the airport shuttle terminates  The rooms are well maintained  They have everything you need towels bodywash shampoo hair dryer  The bed was king sized  I paid CAD for the room  Its a great room for this value I was initially concerned when I read some reviews saying this hotel was near the red light district but I didnt notice such activities  To be fair I didnt walk around the neighbourhood too much but between the hotel and the metro station things look fine all there is is a university across the street Will recommend to budget minded travellers  If you plan to explore Montreal by public transportation like I did this hotel is for you  
P => Great value Comfortable and Clean My partner and I stayed at the Hotel St Denis for  nights over Christmas   Overall we found this hotel to be clean comfortable and extremely convenient for the cafes bars and restaurants of Saint Denis  Here is our sumyPros  Great Location    metro stops from main downtown area  Room cleaned daily  AMAZINGLY comfortable Queen sized bed room   Large  inch television  Cheerful multi lingual reception staffCons  Very noisy Next rooms shower pigeons at window early morning garbage pick ups at buildings rear  Sheetstowels cleaned using far too much Javel WaterBleachThere is usually breakfast available however during our stay the breakfast room was being reated Overall if you can get this hotel for around CAD per night you are getting an absolute bargain compared to other hotels in this price range  On this basis it gets our highest recommendation  
P => good for the price I spend  dollars for a king size bed bedroom  The blanket and sheet and carpeting are a little bit aged but clean  Bathroom is also clean except a little stain on the ceiling near the shower  Staffs are ok and helpful  Pay  dollars for parking and it really save a lot of work  Would consider stay again  
P => Nice hotel   Good value for money  Location not great Stayed here for one night  The hotel itself is perfectly adequate clean up to date with good internet access and friendly staff  Breakfast is OK  For the price it is very good Only thing to watch out for is the location  While it is near all the sights it is one block away from the red light district which has some unsavoury characters walking around it and using the phone booths to relieve themselves  
P => Great Stay for the Price My husband amp I stayed at the St Denis for  nights last weekend we were in Montreal to visit some family and really didnt want to spend a ton of money for a quick trip  Of course we also didnt want to sleep with cockroaches amp crackheads either This is always a concern when travelling to large cities price versus class  I have to say that while the St Denis is not an luxuurious hotel it is very clean conveniently located and reasonably priced  Our only complaint would be the plumbing when showering you basically have  choices a cold shower or a hot drip My husband was particularly annoyed by this but I figured it was a small price to pay for the benefits  We travel quite often and feel fairly well qualified to judge hotels and when I compare the St Denis to other hotels in the same price range in other major cities the St Denis blows them away We once stayed at a hotel in South Beach in the same price range and really did wake up to crackheads on the font stoop left over from the night before So if you want a affordable amp clean hotel within walking distance of clubs restuarants amp tourists areas in the downtown Montreal area the St Denis is excellent choice if you want more than that be ready to pay for it 
P => Clean Friendly Great location We found this hotel by walking from another one that we could not stay at because of the condition of the room  We found this hotel to be clean very courteous staff quiet conveniently located in the downtown area  We were able to walk to everything from the hotel and never had to take the car out of the garage  Our room was large had very comfortable beds and was impeccably clean  Bathrooms are a big deal to me when travelling and this was very clean and sanitized  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for GREAT value for the money  It is not  star so if thats what youre looking for look elsewhere but it is certainly  in my books  Everything you could ask for on a budget  We even had a coffee maker ironing board and iron in our room 
P => Excellent choice I recently stayed two nights at this hotel and was very pleased with it  ProsThe location cant be better with a metro station two blocks away and the central bus station three blocks away  Also Ste  Catherine street is just steps away and you can walk to the old town too  The front desk staff is very helpful  I arrived early in the morning when there still werent any rooms available so I was given a key to a big locker for my luggage for free  The restaurantbistro serves excellent food at very affordable prices with very good service by very friendly staff  My room was quiet confortable well orated of good size had everything I could possibly need and most importantly was very clean  Finally its really affordable ConsThe lobby feels too smallMy room was a little too dark but okThe ac was loud and inefficient fortunately I didnt really need itConclusion I would return for sure 
P => Nice Hotel Great Location We spent  nights at Hotel Saint Denis over a long labor Day weekend  It is a very nice Intown Hotel  The best thing about it was the location right across from the Berri train station that connects  main subway lines amp at the Intersection of St  Denis and St  Catherine  It is in a college area so there are lots of young people around  There is a mall with a grocery store a couple of blocks down St  Catherine  Going North on St  Denis there are some nice restaurants and clubs with a bit of a Bohemian atmosphere in the neighborhood  We did not eat at the Hotel but there is a Panini Restaurant next door that we had  good meals at The room itself was average with an above average bed which is all we really care about  The bathroom was newly remodeled with a good shower  The TV had about  channels I believe  The coffee in the room was some of the best in room coffee Ive ever had  The front desk staff were all helpful  The only real problem was a noisy air conditioner in our room that kept us awake at night when the compressor kicked on  We did not complain to the hotel about it because we thought we would get used to it  We never did  Im sure if we said something to them they would have corrected it  This is just an reminder to check that out if you ide to stay there All in all I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good value accomodations in downtown Montreal  
P => good value Its good value for the money  The rooms were comfortable andthe location was good  Staff was nice  The price had includeda free breakfast in the coffeeshop next door but we found outthat this has changed  The coffee shop changed ownershipand the hotel told us they werent sure what the deal would bewith the new coffee shop owners  The deal currently incudesan  breakfast at another nearby restaurant  
P => The good and the bad The goodlocation in interesting and convenient part of town very near metro low price free breakfast very large room clean esp  bathroom one very firm bed generally quiet one block from bike path on Rue Berri which leads down to the waterfrontThe bada number of unsavory characters panhandling on blocks near hotel very long wait for breakfast very noisy air conditioner other rather sagging bed windows opened onto air shaft rather smoky due to proximity to hotel laundry where chambermaids congregated and smoked  room rather dark and plainAlso of note called hotel directly to book extra large room  queens and a sofa bed and was told none were available  Ended up booking quotsuperior roomquot on Hotels  A week before our arrival had to call hotel to change dates by one day and was offered extra large room for our whole stay  Perhaps one had become available    Recommendation go to La Brioche Lyonnaise just up Rue St  Denis for beautifully presented and delicious breakfasts in their rear garden All in all would possibly stay there again for the location and the price  
P => Affordable Downtown Surrounded by these cool lounges pubs and cafes St  Denis stands out for the location the price and the cleanliness  It is a small hotel yet it is located in Center City on one of the main streets where the hip pubs are located  St  Denis is a walking distance from everywhere Old City Museums Latin Square etc   The rooms not bad in size and great  The service was quick and the front desk staff were very friendly They provided us with maps and tips on where to go best places to eat etc     WIll I go back to St  Denis Sure I do not see my self paying top dollars to be in a Sheraton or Hilton when I can find the same quality and comfort at a smaller hotel in Center City Montreal  
P => Cozy and Charming Great location easy walking distance to everything  The rooms were clean and quiet and each had its own AC something we really appreciated during the heat wave  The prices were excellent and I would stay there again no question  Catherine at the front desk was a treasure    she told us about a really great Portuguese restaurant that was one of the highlights of our trip  As soon as I find out the name Ill post a review  Also the restaurant which ajoins LAddress I think was wonderful just in case you dont care to venture outside  
P => Excellent Value Stayed the night of y st for the Just for Lhs festival  I booked the room on Orbitz a couple of weeks before and got the room for  CDN  I was very pleased with the location  It is right next to the Berri UQAM metro station near the corner of St Denis and St Catherine  The room abutted a courtyard that appeared to be shared with the university so there was no street noise  The room itself was basic but clean and comfortable  My air conditioner was small but I set it to  and was comfortable  The queen bed slept well and the free breakfast was filling sausage potatoes toast coffee  The elevator is quite slow so just take the stairs adjacent if you are on the first couple of floors and dont have much luggage  The room was without an alarm clock and facial tissues but I had brought my own and it wasnt a great inconvenience Parking can be had for  CDN  I found the garage and parked before checking in  Though the spaces are numbered they didnt seem to have a problem with where I parked when I discussed it with the front desk  Since I had already parked the front desk attendant told me that it would be cheaper to just use the ticket I received when I parked rather than using a pass the hotel gives you  It turns out it cost me  to get out  So take the pass the hotel gives you at check in  
P => Affordable and Clean For  CND pp inc  taxes St Denis was a very good deal  The location is great    Its located right on St  Catherine and we walked everywhere inc  club area Notre Damme and Museum of Contemporary Arts Old Montreal China Town etc  The room itself was pretty basic but very clean at the same time same goes for the washroom  Staff was friendly and helpful parking was secure the restaurant was also pretty good although we only had breakfast there  The only drawback is that AC wasnt that powerful but it was a pretty hot time of the year  I would stay there again  
P => Great basic hotel The room and bathroom were clean the bed was nice and the staff is very professional friendly and helpful  The hotel restaurant is great for breakfast excellent crepes and it is a good bistro restaurant wine bar and pub  Walking left out of the hotel on St Denis Street there are small restaurants cafes and shops for third of a mile along St  Denis Street and then on intersecting Duluth Street in both directions for serveral blocks there are small restaurants some are BYO wine and some have terrace dining  Ignore the review about a maid trying to steal clothes Sounds like a simple mistake to me  Who would want someones dirty clothes Really  Similalry the area is downtown urban lively but I saw no prostitutes in the street  
P => Fantastic My friend and I both paid   per night for our twin room so werent expecting anything special but Denis was great  I understand some of the rooms are small but ours came equipped with two double beds a sofa a tv with cable coffee making facilities an iron hairdryer and plenty of storage for clothes and the like  Theres also a restaurant attached to Denis which makes great meals  We got some vouchers to have our breakfast free for the first three days   after that you have to pay but the menu offers affordable prices The Hotel provides exactly what it says on the site  The rooms are clean and well orated and the staff were kind and very helpful  Apart from the maids they all spoke perfect english and were happy to give us directions when we wanted to go somewhere  Most stuff is in walking distance and if it isnt destinations such as the theme park and BiodomeOlympic towerInsectariumBotanical Gardens are very accessable on the Metro which has trains running every five minutes  so no waiting around Id recommend Hotel Denis to anyone visiting Montreal  Theyre the best place Ive ever stayed in and if I go back to Montreal Id definitely stay there  If any of the staff are reading this then Id like to say thank you for the wonderful service   
P => Great Location and Budget Friendly My rating might seem high as its based on the fabulous locationproximity to transportation and area attractions as well as the first rate front desk staff The rooms are what they are  They are small the bedding and towels are clean but well used and the bathroom situation is not ideal  The sink basin in our room was located outside the bathroom right next to the front door and the floor below it got wet easily  There is also no counter space  The water closet itself is literally no larger than your bathub at home  You open the door and the toilet and shower stall the size of a cruise ship one are face to face with little room to move That said parking is located in a garage around the block on Rue Christin and is easy to use no attendant you get a ticket pass from the hotel and go inout as you please  The location is right off UQAM and the Berri subway station and you can walk easily to the Underground City shopping and Vieux Montreal  Its also quite easy to get to locations outside the immediate area by car e g  Biodome Parc Mont Royal The front desk staff is helpful multi lingual and especially good about giving directions and answering questions about attractions  
P => Quaint gem in the heart of downtown Montreal We stayed at the St Denis for one night Saturday with another couple  We prebooked a non smoking room with two queen beds and thats exactly what we got  We paid  which seemed to be quite inexpensive in Montreal on a long weekend  The front lobby staircase hallways and elevator are small and in some places narrow but all in all its a great little hotel Dont expect your typical quotchainquot atmosphere and keep in mind that this hotel was originally built in the s    The beds were very comfortable the hotel room lobby hallways were all clean and welcoming and the service we received was friendly and efficient  Parking was just around the corner for night   quite reasonable for an indoor secure parking lot in downtown Montreal  Once we got there we parked the car and walked or cabbed anywhere we wanted to go One thing I found VERY convenient travelling with another couple was that the bathshower was in its own quotbathroomquot and the sinktoilet was in a arate quotbathroomquot  Made showering etc    much easier when we were all trying to get readyI would recommend this hotel to anyone who is tired of staying in the quotbig boxquot hotels or is just looking for a nice quaint getaway at a reasonable rate By the way I had read reviews here about the hotel being very noisy but I can say that when I was trying to get to sleep at  ish in the morning on a Saturday night there was barely a sound to be heard with the windows open    it  depend on which side of the hotel youre on  
P => Pretty Good for the price    Okay I would say overall youre going to get your moneys worth as long as you bear in mind that youre not staying at a  star   for the most part  I stayed for the weekend drove from CT and stayed w my boyfriendThe Good Staff was super duper friendly the parking is pretty secure the room itself is almost impeccable when it came to cleanliness it is quiet for the msot part and in a pretty ent location   there was a tv with cable a phone ironing board and hair dryer like the web site advertises   the resutraunt attached to the hotel was amazing we ate there first  the rooms and the hotel are basically niceThe Bad The heat is controlled at the front desk and was kept on both nights  when we complained about it they aploogized but said that there was nothing they could do  theres construction on the beggining on st denis and they failed to mention that which made getting there nearly impossible  there was no clock included although you can program the tv to wake you up  st denis street is loud and somewhat intimidating after am so just beware of the chanting teenagers at am 
P => Loved it My Boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel for  days in early il and had a wonderful stay  The front desk is VERY helpful whether we asked for directions or reccomendations they never seemed fussed to answer us with the best of their ability  The hotel is VERY centrally located as well  Right by the UQAM metro station which is a major hub on the metro line as well as Old Montreal  St Denis Street houses so many restaurants and cute cafes and bars we couldnt choose where to eatThe hotel is very clean and the complimentary breakfast next door at the connecting cafe was delicious and very accomoadting before a day out in the city  EVERYONE spoke English so there were no language barriers to overcome or slow down our trip  Our only disappointment was that there was no mini fridge however we managed without itI highly reccomend this hotel  
P => Great Location My boyfriend and I recently stayed at St  Denis and loved it The room was clean and the hotel staff was friendly  There is an amazing bar and restaurant attached to the hotel so that was great  We had an amazing time and would definitely stay there again  Enjoy 
P => Fantastic Hotel Six of us stayed at the Hotel St Denis during Comedy Fest for  days  It was probably the best vacation we have ever had  The hotel was clean and comfortable  The staff were very nice even when we rolled in at  oclock in the morning  The resturant had really good food and I am fussy If you go to the resturant in the afternoon I suggest the Cheese Plate and ask the waiter recommend a wine to go with it  We are definatly returning  
P => A great Montreal find I booked this hotel based on the positive TripAdvisor reviews of it that I read and I was very pleased with my stay  My boyfriend and I were there for one night in ust and we loved the price location friendly service complimentary breakfast and underground parking  We stayed in a queen sized room which was on the small side but quite comfortable for our one night and had all of the amenities that we expected  The breakfast was served in a bistro adjacent to the hotel and there were excellent choices  There were also Montrealers at the table next to ours which I take as a good sign that its more than just a place for the hotels tourists  The hotel has a great downtown location very close to a major metro station and a popular stretch of St Denis St  and within reasonable walking distance of many terrific neighbourhoods and attractions  I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone because I think that it is such a great deal  
P => A mixed bag We stayed at the Hotel St  Denis in il  with  other couples  We are all in our late twenties or early thirties There are some good things about this little hotel  The rates are a great deal  We found the staff to be helpful and friendly  They pour a great Stella downstairs at the bistro even washing the outside of the glass before giving it to you  The rooms were fine nothing exceptional but certainly comfortable and clean  The location is good in that you can walk to lots of great parts of the city  It seems like this hotel is alot nicer than its immediate surroundings  We did actually see prostitutes near the hotel certainly not going into the hotel  We found the room to be a little stuffy so we tried to regulate the heat by opening the window  Unfortunatly our window opened up to a side streetalley where we could hear bottles smashing and people yelling until dawn almost  It certainly wasnt a good nights sleep  You  want to ask for a room in the front of the hotel We were there in il and noticed that there didnt seem to be any airconditioning  They  put in window units for the summer but I would call to find out for sure if you plan to visit in the summer All in all I am not sure I would stay here again although I dont regret staying here  I didnt feel unsafe but I am an urban dweller and probably have a little more tolerance for the type of neighborhood the Hotel St  Denis is in  Finally it looks like the area the hotel is in is sort of up and coming area  Perhaps in a few years the area surrounding the hotel will be a bit nicer  Of course if that is that case the hotel could easily charge alot more money  
P => You get what you pay for When it comes to cheap hotels Hotel St  Denis is above average  The staff are REALLY nice and helpful  The breakfeast was at a very cute bistro downstairs  But the rooms are rather dark and dingy    and dont go south of the hotel     very shady area Overall it was ok although Im not sure I would stay again  But if youre on a budget its ent

P => Warmly Modern and Lovely Just wrapped up a  night day stay at Hotel St Paul  Staff were really nice and very helpful  The hotel was the most modern that Ive personally stayed in though it still felt warm and cozy  Its on the cusp of Old Montreal so you dont get the same obnoxious amp noisy tourist pedestrian traffic at night like other hotels experiences Ive had in the area  The continental breakfast was the right amount of food and selection to make four days breakfast not feel the same day in and day out  Fantastic location made it easy to get quite a lot done during what felt like not a long enough trip Close proximity to local transit spas shopping across the river from the casino bars clubs and fabulous restaurants made doing a lot stress free and unrushed  The windows open to allow fresh air in   thats rare and I loved it Adored it will stay again and would recommend it to anyone 
P => very small room to work in   I took a regular room   oh boy what a mistake  The wired internet connection was in one area and the only table you could work on was in a completly different area  If you have to travel and work there get a bigger room  If only for leisure the regular room was a typical european room small  Windows open   that is a nice touch But the hotel is indeed a design hotel  sometime so design that they seem to have forgotten the purpose of an accessory  clean staff  altough really understaff when I went was nice and polite and well situated if you want to visit the old Montreal area  It is further away from the well known Crescent street but within a walking distance if you are a good walker  
P => Boutique Hotel with style and quality service came to Montreal to check out the city from San Diego  I booked directly thru the front desk and while the process was a bit challenging at first it finished on a very strong note  gave me a fair room rate and the room I requested  design is strong a tiny bit dated but overall enjoyed the feel of the hotel  the bar scene was worth the stay as well  part of the experience in staying in a hotel of this nature is the common area and the scene that comes with it  Housekeeping was very good nice guest amenities in the rooms turn down service etc  breakfast was solid and good  location is great  Old Montreal is a nice area to walk  several good restaurants in the area  I would return and would suggest a stay  
P => Shabby Very Shabby    Not for the discerning Boutique hotel lover Firts of all Ive stayed here  times    I come from NY drop about  bucks for a  nights stay and keep telling myself never again  Everything else was bookedGood Availability u can guess whyIssues Never a doorman    i mean never    holy security issue batmanNeed another bottle of champagne in the room after pm Sorry its locked upSome rooms feel like you are in a shoebox    aesthetic more than sizeCheap crappy lounge restaurant    quotSorry cant take the     dollar glasses of champagne to your room because we might lose the glassesquot quotIll return themquot    quotsorryquot    really suburban crowed    read  too much hair gel and muscle shirts with cheap shoes   
P => Every comfort and exceedingly helpful  DONT miss breakfast  Spent two nights at the St  Paul while attending a boat show in the Vieux Port  Hotel is sleek well located and extremely comfortable  Staff were friendly and helpful  Quick to meet requests  Lobby bar is pricey but service is excellent  Breakfast for residents is flat out supurb  
P => Unforgettable I stayed here for New Years eve  with a couple of friends and it was an incredible stay  The hotel is a perfect definition of boutique hotel with all the right details including modern trendy or a fire place in the lobby and beautiful accents  We attended the new years eve party which was chic but not stuff  The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly and could not do enough to ensure we enjoyed our stay  The rooms are wonderfully orated and have fabulous fur blankets which were great for lounging under on a lazy new years day  There is a great oversized tub in the bathrooms and the robes got a lot of use as well as the mini bar  The breakfast buffet was modest but delicious with pastries baked goods and coffee  I have to commend the great service of Mika l 
P => Nice Clean Hotel in Old Montreal I came here for a business meeting that was set up by local colleagues in Montreal  The rooms have a trendy appeal to them and are very clean and comfortable  The lobby has a boutique style read small but nice and there is a very good bar and restaurant off to the side  Other stuffWe used meeting rooms in the hotel and they were more than adequate Breakfast was included  It was a little more than continental which was fine Location is good    Old Montreal Service was friendly and quick Internet was free  
P => An Incredible Experience I love the St Paul Hotel one thing that really stands out about the St  Paul is the staff The St  Pauls staff is incredible they cater to all your possible needs they are courteous and polite I look forward to every visit I have in Montreal and the St  Paul adds a whole lot to my time spent there  M O  
P => One for Bruno This hotel is located on the edge of the old Montreal and very easy to access by car from outside town It s uber trendy and minimalist When we booked our room we got a free upgrade to a ior suite  When we checked in we were told that the ior suite wasn t quite ready so we got upgraded again to a deluxe suite Needless to say the suite was big Stylish living room with cow skin rug glass dinning area huge bathroom with hisamphis sinks bath tub at one end and walk in shower big enough for  at the other end  The bedroom was completely white with faux fur bed cover and head rest  Gorgeous and relaxing I loved the hotel but was somewhat not impressed by Montreal itself For dinner you should go to Le Petit Moulinsard for the best Belgium cuisine  On the other hand absolutely avoid the Verses  The deer is good but the waiting staff is awful 
P => Such a unique hotel Nice change from the ordinary If you travel an awful lot like our group you will truly appreciate the unique experience this hotel has to offer  If you re sick of staying at regular hotels and find yourself occasionally trying to get into the wrong room because you re on auto pilot do yourself a favour and book at Hotel St  Paul for your next visit to Montreal  The hotel staff are absolutely great every time we stay at this hotel There has always been someone there to help with our bags check us all in and park our cars  Another important thing to note is that these staff are always smiling You  be a bit surprised at the nightlife if you stay on a Thursday night but this is just one of the fun and unique features about the hotel  The rooms are gorgeous and you ll find everything you need I ve stayed on the McGill side every time and I do not have a complaint about the noise as was mentioned in another post on this site  The d cor of the rooms are beautiful and quite unique  I don t want to give it away in here   just something I think you need to experience for yourself I ll admit that the beds are a bit hard for my liking but then again this is just my preference and what I am use to sleeping in at home  Breakfast is a great at the hotel fruit cheese pastries a variety of breads eggs and yogurt  They are always replenishing all of the above so no need to worry if something looks to be empty  We have never had a problem with any vandalism to any of our vehicles while staying at the hotel  It s a shame that one person did experience this however when ever you park anywhere there is always a chance that this could happen Once one of my colleagues did get a flat tire this was a reoccurring problem with this particular rental vehicle and the valet staff were more then happy to help her with it  The staff at this hotel are always helpful in these instances which make our stays much more enjoyable  My favourite thing in the hotel   If you have time make sure you try out the bathtub And in all seriousness   If there aren t enough towels why not just call the front desk and ask I hope this review has been helpful With having over  staff booked at this hotel only a few weeks ago we have no complaints as we all enjoy the time that we spend in Montreal and look forward to our next stays at Hotel St  Paul  
P => A real disappointment    Stayed at the St Paul for three nights on work assignment  Main purpose was to be able to relax after a long day  Ill break it down in a concise mannerThe GoodThe hotel is located in old Montreal and is surrounded by trendy upper middle class oriented restaurants and cafes  The immediate area has a European charm to it and makes for a nice getaway  The building the hotel is housed in in itself is a gorgeous early th century high rise  The interior has been expertly orated and feels very modern  Room was clean and felt comfortable  Food in the restaurant is very good and priced reasonably well  The free high speed internet  wired  was also a nice touch The BadWhere does one begin The staff is spotty with a few great people surrounded by snooty and condescending individuals  On our last morning on check out there was no one to even help with bagsdoor  I think its safe to say that the hotel is understaffed  On top of this we had the misfortune of having our vehicle broken into  not quotvandalizedquot as the staff preferred to call it  while parked in the outdoor parking area  There was a mix up by the valet in not parking it in the more secure underground parking  When we were told of the incident the staff were not helpful or in any way remorseful  On top of this the mix up was handled terribly by the valet  I understand that parking lots in Montreal are a target for thieves but if youre providing your customers with a valet service and treat a huge inconvenience such as ours with such tactless disinterest it does not come off well  You are after all in the service industry  It is not a privilege for me to stay there  Rather it is your privilege to have me stay there  Terrible experience The hotel houses a very popular and trendy barrestaurant and it seems that the regular Thursday night party runs well into the early morning  McGill street facing rooms will have to deal with a lot of noise  be even the whole weekend is a write off with noise Im not sure as I didnt stay through it  Not a great thing to have to deal with if youre trying to get some rest As previously mentioned the beds are very hard and thus will be uncomfortable for a lot of people  The selection of toiletries is minimal and considering what the room rates are like this seems like a travesty  There werent enough towels for the two us and the turn down quotsnackquot consisted of a single chocolate for two people  How considerate FINALLYSt Paul is the perfect place for a party seeking well off individual seeking the trendy confines of a stylishly heartless overpriced hotel  I would never again stay here neither would I allow clients to book me there in the near future  I think a lot of work needs to be put into the training of the staff to make sure that they know what customers need expect and what respect is  If this was my business I would slowly start firing a  of the staff and replace them with the kind of people who actually enjoy working at a hotel for a living  There is no need for such attitude Its the little things that count that give hotels its charm and soul  As such it is my unfortunate opinion that the Hotel St Paul lacks both and will still need a lot of managerial work in order to get it to be the kind of place that I would like to stay at  A great comparable hotel would be the Opus  Same idea much better experience  
P => Trendy and beautiful hotel in the heart of old Montreal I stayed at the St  Paul this past winter for a couple of nights  Heading into a girls weekend in Montreal we were attracted to the St  Paul for its great location and excellent reputation Upon entering the lobby I was stunned by the or and and beautiful details like the modern fireplace and creative furniture pieces  The restaurant was also bustling with activity and was clearly the place to be for the well dressed good looking clientele Our room was gorgeous   very clean and beautifully orated  The canopies on the beds gave the room a very light and airy feel which was anchored by the dark hardwood floors  The giant windows overlooking the city offered wonderful natural light and a magnificent view The bathroom complete with embracing bathrobes and deep soaking tub was perfect for a couple looking for a romantic getaway  While the price was a little high the quality and service make the St  Paul well worth it The staff were exceptionally accomodating and friendly  I would definitely like to stay there again soon  Magnifique 
P => The only hotel I stay at when in Montreal Hotel St  Paul is truly a gem of a hotel  Located between the downtown core and Old Montreal it is steps away from all the attractions the city has to offer  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the service is first rate  And the luxurious guest rooms feature all the comforts of home and then some  This is the true definition of a boutique hotel and the only hotel I stay at when in Montreal  
P => All style but no substance Just returned from a long weekend in Montreal  Quiet and great location unfortunately still a disappointing stay Heres a list Very uncomfortable bed and pillows    never could get a good nights sleep Air conditioning never worked properly House cleaning left the door open House cleaning cleared a bottle of wine from the room    but never touched or replaced the glasses left on the floor beside the bed where the wine bottle was House cleaning walked in despite the quotdo not disturbquot sign 
P => Like my home in Montreal Living in NYC I always go to Montreal for a long weekend as it is a wonderful city to hang out  Part of the reason I feel this is the St Paul  I will only stay there and have been for years  I find the Hotel chic and quite this is not like a chain  It has a personality of its own which I find very Montreal and a great staff  I understand that there  be newer hotels just down the street but their cookie cutter style is just not cutting it for me  I am going again in the start of  and will be at the St Paul 
P => Great hotel   Awesome Staff We stayed in this hotel as part of our  weeks in Canada in tember  Wed booked it via Canadian Affair as they are able to offer preferential rates when you book flights etc with them  Before departure wed read some fo the reviews and of course when you see some negatives you wonder if youd made the right ision  But we work on the theory that its all subjective and in the end we ided we DID make the right choice   We pulled up outside after a  hour drive from Toronto a member of hotel staff welcomed us and helped us unload our luggage  Now some people  not like a quotrelaxed but polite and efficientquot attitude among staff in the service industry   but we felt it hit the spot just right for our welcome He helped us with our bags and arranged for our vehicle to be parked   what else do you need  Check in was efficient and once again helpful and with a smile and that was the story for the service throughout our  day stay  Our room was compact especially with  of us staying in it   but extremely well equipped and comfortable with all we needed for our stay  Every night there was a turn down service with a small chocolate left for each of us and every morning our compimentary paper awaited us  The complimentary continental style breakfast was more than adequate with a wide variety of juices and more than set us up for  days of exploring Montreal The location was fantastic   in the old town with a huge choice of eateries and bars around us   and once again the staff came up trumps with their recommendations for somewhere to eat   an amazing Italian restaurant which is located in what used to be the womens jail   a must place to eat  Would we stay here again   in a heartbeat   we actually would struggle to criticise this hotel at all   for us the service was pitched at the right level   relaxed but very efficient and polite and ALWAYS friendly and with a smile  The location was perfect the rooms comfortable albeit  be considered small by the standards of many North American hotelsthe ambience was excellent and the small touches like internet access turn down service papers breakfast etc all included in the price just added that extra sheen  We made our choice   and it definately was the right one PS   we didnt detect any quotnastyquot niffs during our stay  
P => Would stay here again in a heartbeat My parents met my boyfriend and me here for my th birthday and we had just a fabulous time  We never did have a chance to eat at the restaurant that was there at the time Cube is it still but we had cocktails at the bar both nights that we stayed and the bartenders were so nice and friendly  The hotel is totally funky and our room was just so cool    check out the pictures here posted by others  On the night of my birthday one of the staff had a piece of luscious chocolate cake candle and everything delivered to my room  On top of all that it is in a prime location for exploring Vieux Montreal and all of its restaurants and arty shops as well as the waterfront you can see the Habitat and the Biosphere in just a short walk and some other old historic places  Just the old architecture around this place is amazing  The warm and fuzzy touches    the arm in arm bathrobes the chocolate on your pillow with the temperature forecast the really nice toiletries    all were icing on the cake Other than the cold Canadian winter my birthday is in ember I cant think of any negatives  We loved every restaurant it is Montreal after all all of which were in the neighborhood and many with live music  I remember one desk staff guy was irritated when I greeted him in French and then couldnt follow through I can say all the important stuff in a lot of languages but thats about it he got over it and was really very helpful every other time I have just great memories of this weekend and not just because it was my birthday 
P => What a treat I recently travelled to Montreal on business and the St Paul was recommended by our local colleagues  What a lovely experience from the moment we arrived at the front of the elegant entrance  Attentive staff classy modern or through to every last detail in the rooms   thoughtful lighting music playing on arrival quality bathroom items bathrobes etc etc  Situated near the waterfront and many wonderful bars and restaurant   the perfect location for those who enjoy comfortable quiet surroundings  My only wish is that we could have stayed longer 
P =>  Stars We just got back from Hotel St  Paul  We booked a room which was called quotQueen Deluxe  upgradedquot  Given that we travel quite a bit an have been to some of really nice hotels Mandarin Oriental Banyan Tree Ritz these are what we thought about Hotel St  Paul Positive If you are looking for a good location and pleasant staff then this is it  The hotel locates near very nice boutiques galleries and restaurants  Front desk staff is very helpful in terms of arranging for taxi and giving directionssuggestions places to visit restaurants metro etc  Negative Given a rating on this website Hotel St Paul receives  stars which I think is misleading  The hotels bed smaller than Queen size and pillows are suitable for those who like their mattress and pillows Firm  We asked for  extra down soft pillow in the morning and in the afternoon housekeeping staff told us that they did not get the request  Nonetheless when I asked another staff he brought us yet another firm pillow  Also being that Montreal is in a cold part of the world the only thin carpet in the room was sparse and there was no rug to be found  
P => Absolutely Excellent If youre into super posh hotels that I have never been to be this one is lacking as these other people claim however if you are used to the hostel to mid grade hotel stay this place is excellent in comparison My boyfriend and I went for  days in ust to get away and we had such a great time It was such a nice place we felt like we didnt belong the entire time and absolutely loved it The area itself is Old Montreal so its a little expensive but theres a couple of convenience stores Couche Tarde for easy things within walking distance and its really only a short walk to Ste  Catherines or even Chinatown  If you dont walk Place Victoria metro is not more than  block away  Its an absolutely exceptional hotel if your into modern themes Definately check it out you wont be disappointed  
P => One small problem Let me preface this review by saying that I booked this hotel at the last minute for a summer weekend in Montreal so I understand that availability was seriously limited in addition to this expedia did state the rate was a slightly discounted one We stay in Montreal quite a bit as my husbands head office is based in the city  We do like to stay in the smaller boutique hotels in old Montreal and have had some wonderful stays at some truly memorable hotels  As to our stay at the St Paul I will not be booking there again for which there was only one reason  My reason for not staying in the hotel is that I am sure that we were given the worst room in the building and the worst room in this building is not good  The issue was that that the windows of this room look into a dark square surrounded on all sides by other buildings and fire escapes  The result is that the room is so dark that you must have the lights on at all times to be able to see and if you want an idea of the weather you actually need to go downstairs to determine what to wear for the day because you actually cannot see any daylight at all from the windows of this room  I found this room to be so claustrophobic that I wanted to be out of there the minute that I woke up and unfortunately this coloured my whole experience at this hotel  I will say that staff in this hotel were pleasant and helpful and were happy to discuss the best places to see in the city and advise if they thought that some of our planned stops  not have been the best idea given our short stay in the area  In addition to this their location is perfect if your plan is to wander around the city It really was a shame because the room itself was perfectly fine clean and as another reviewer commented the tub is to die for  So my suggestion is this if you are booking into this hotel make sure you ask for a room with a view 
P => This is THE place to stay in Old Montreal The Hotel St  Paul is the only way to experience Old Montreal  I spent three nights there and absolutely loved it  The or was planned perfectly reflecting sleek European design  The style in fact helps you realize that you really have left the United States when going to Montreal Hotel St  Pauls staff was attentive and hospitable without being overbearing  They speak both English and French flawlessly and they were kind enough to tolerate my feeble attempts at the latter  In fact this was one of the best hotel teams I have seen The rooms were a bit smaller than youll find in major brand hotels but I found them to be perfectly sufficient  There was a workspace between the bedroom and bathroom which normally would be folded into a larger bedroom and I liked the distinction between work and relaxation that it afforded If you stay at the Hotel St  Paul you will have to sacrifice the loyalty points that come with the major brands but its worth it  You will never have an experience quite like this at the big chains  
P => Promised so much       Heard great things about Montreal and ided on a weekend break  Looked for a boutique hotel and the St Paul filled the purpose Located on the fringe of Vieux Montreal it is a little out of the way even if located on a main thoroughfare  Nearest metro station is c  min walk away from where you can get to the rest of the city The room was spacious however needed a little TLC  Blinds were broken sofa was old and buckled and needed replacing bed was uncomfortable The worst part though was breakfast  I have never experienced such a calamity  There was no order or organisation  Tables were left dirty and not clearedcleaned  Patrons waited for some time to be seated  Insufficient number of staff on the floor to run the breakfast shift  Food was ordinary and uninviting From a city with so much to give felt totally let down by the hotel  This could be a wonderful place to stay but fell well short of its boutique status  
P => Great Location My Wife and I were here in e of  and really enjoyed our stay Great location for walking around Montreal  Very close to the old port area and short walk up to St Catherine  A Bit of a hike to St Steven but very doable if the weather is nice We chose a Superior Room and it was a bit smaller than expected but very comfortable and we were not in the room all that much Staff is extremely helpful and courteous  Will stay again  
P => Extremely Average Hotel Stayed at Hotel St  Paul for Christmas  Very average accomodation  The hotel totally lacks any ambience or atmosphere  My main issue with the rooms was the level of cleanliness  Whilst pouring water into the iron I spilled some water on the timber floor  I got tissues to clear it up and the tissue was black with dirt when I was done wiping up the water  As the hotel is downtown in Old Montreal and the nightlife is     min walk in the Catherine St  Cresent St area I would not recocomend the location to people looking for a party scene  
P => Nice building but    I had stayed at the St Paul a couple of years ago and had a moderate experience  I thought that over time it  have improved so I ided to return   If anything it has sadly lined in service and cleanliness  I was shocked at the rude behaviour from some of the staff  the poor quality food  and the sub standard housekeeping  There is no point in detailing my experience however I suggest that when travelling to Montreal there are a number of other hotels in the area to choose from   It boggles my mind how a hotel can charge approx    a night for a suite that has black mould around the bath tub and stains on all of the upholstery  I dont see this property doing very well in the future unless the management takes steps to improve  
P => an Elegant Surprise After carefully considering our many options my husband and I ided to stay at the Hotel St Paul We were very pleasantly surprised   in every aspect  We were given the warmest reception by the doorman and the receptionist   both were extremely polite and seemed genuinely happy  Our room was on the th floor facing the street   I thought it might be noisy but it was actually very quiet  Our room was pleasantly air conditioned when we arrived and we both enjoyed that classical music was playing when we entered the room  it seemed very homey and welcomingespecially in such a minimalist themed hotel  The room design was calming and beautiful and the giant bath tub was a real treat  We enjoyed the morning breakfasts very much   compared to other buffets this had so much class and seemed refined People were encouraged to relax and read the paper to take a seat on the cozy velvet sofas and just spend time enjoying the morning The waiting staff were quick and professional We couldnt have been happier about the location and walked to many tourist sights such as the Cathedralthe docksthrough the Old city and to the ket Bonsecours having no trouble finding our way back  The restaurants in the surrounding area Old Montreal were many and we especially enjoyed a nearby charcutterie and crepes at a dessert shop I was actually shocked at the friendliness of all we encountered during our visit   I had heard rumours of unfriendliness in the locals and must say it is absolutely false If you gowear a smile and expect courtesy and professionalism   thats what you will receive and much more 
P => Super stylish helpful and convenient hotel Loved this hotel located conveniently in the Old City We went there for a long weekend in ust and had a wonderful stay  The high level of service started even before we got there we had requested a smoking standard sized room on the penthouse floor and were informed that the floor was non smoking however they could upgrade our room to a ior Suite on a lower floor that allowed smoking  So we ended up with a suite for the price of a standard room thank you St  PaulEveryone at the front desk was extremely helpful in making reservations for us arranging cars and suggesting restaurants to go to  The hotel is really beautiful in a NYSohoTribeca loft kind of way   high ceilings with big windows lots of natural light dark wood floors minimal or and gorgeous staff  Compared to the lightness of the rooms the hallways and elevators are really dark like a nightclub  Great bathroom with large tub and lovely bath products and robes  Very good chocolates given out  The room was surprisingly noise free although one night I could hear the bass of a nightclub diagonally across the street when I had the window open  The hotel itself is located on a main street that is somewhat quiet at night  There is a Metro stop a few blocks away and your located near some great restaurants  We had a great time and would highly recommend  
P => A comfortable stay We have just come back from a three night stay at the Hotel Saint Paul in Montreal which we booked through Sweet Deals Montreal  The hotel is located in the Old Port on McGill Street  Great location walking distance to all major attractions in the Old Town and a short cab ride or longer walk away from the shopping and night life of downtown  We booked a standard queen roomfabulous comfortable bed great shower and bath  Minor annoyances phone for local calls didnt work safe broke down was fixed after we waited for a technician  The stay included a continental breakfast which was ent and got our day started  On the down side we were not too impressed with the service of the staff specifically the concierge  They were pleasant enough but had a hard time answering tourist related questions such as those regarding current festivals yoga classes location of cafes etc  We have been to Montreal several times and have stayed at the W Hotel very funky and cool the Nelligan pricey but fabulous luxury and the Chateau Versailles just okay  We would definitely go back to the W and Nelligan might go back to Saint Pauls  
P => Wonderful  Three of us stayed in this hotel  nights  It is in the middle of an area with lots of students artists and restaurants  It is near Old Montreal and within walking distance of great food  The staff was very helpful  The breakfast which is included was great and the setting lovely  The hotel is in an old building which has been reated and has a variety of wonderful rooms which retain elements of the old brick and courtyard  The place was also immaculate  
P => Will go back every time I loved this hotel  Talk about a four five star hotel  You get the paper every morning  At night your bed is made the lights dimmed and a little surprise left for you  The rooms were big and very clean just excellent  The hotel is  blocks from the old port and several museums  IN addition it is only  minutes walking distance from downtown  The only thing is that wasnt much variety for the breakfast  toast cereal boiled eggs muffins  Other than this the staff was very helpful and the hotel was excellent  english and french spoken   
P => Overall nice but a little rough around the edges We stayed in a ior suite which was nicely laid out  The bathroom is very nice  However the sofa in the living room was surprisingly dirty a white sofa    probably a bad choice to start with which was a turn off especially when one is paying   Service was pleasant but my experience with the doormen was similar to that of a previous poster    they were often not around  Since we were with a child and stroller their absence was noticed  Otherwise though the staff were very kind and attentive  I did notice however that room service dishes and trays remained in the hallways for a long time  The continental breakfast was very good and the chocolates at turn down were delicious The location is wonderful for tourists  Overall it was a nice and comfortable hotel experience but not quite as nice as I expected for the rate  
P => Luxe boutique hotel Traveled there some time ago but am considering a visit again so Im posting my experience  Ive been to a few smaller hotels before Hotel Godin and le Meridien but the sleeker modern feel of St Paul attracted me  The hotel is definitely the sleekest and most minimally gorgeous one in Montreal  The lobby is fantastic with the large fireplace and cute minibar at the front while the hallways are shrouded in a unique red glow that gives a real feel to the place  The room is similarly orated with clean lines and a wonderful bedding and nice finishes we had a great view of the city too from our window  The desk staff were a joy to deal with but the service needs some work for a hotel of this caliber  Check in was great and the concierge service is certainly one of the better ones to get hard to find reservations and city know how  A TV problem was attended to and fixed in just a few minutes  Very smooth and professional every time I spoke with the desk  But room service was below par as one night the very small minibar counter hadnt been cleaned and another night the bathroom still had robes and towels on the floor It didnt actually bother us that much and we were too busy to report it but compared to hotels even below this class the lack of basic room cleaning seemed very out of place with the hotels projected class  Another more irritating issue was the iron had some sort of odd residue that I didnt notice that lead to it permanently staining one of my shirts  I called the front desk with the problem and the iron was replaced but otherwise nary an acknowledgment of the damage  The restaurant is truly wonderful and an exceptional deal for the prix fixe lunch I had one of the best salads there in my life  The continental breakfast is the expected buffet with a nice selection of fruit cereals pastries in a very nice dining area  In spite of the service guffaws I plan to stay there again and book a suite for the next trip when business allows   the great look and the always congenial if not competent service is enough to give it another shot PROS Beautiful everything Wonderful restaurant Excellent concierge and staff dealingsCONS Obvious room service issues Iron ked my shirt Hotel didnt seem to care Doorman was inconsistent great when he was around but only about  the time  
P => Hotel St  Paul   Minimalist design  Nice modern   yet unpretentious   hotel in good albeit somewhat outer part of the old town   min  walk to center of old town  Excellent helpful staff We opted for a ior suite which included a arate sitting area with additional TV  Nice touches included chocolate turndown service with music and lovely toiletries previous post complained but its all a matter of taste  Some areas of the suite showed a little wear  For instance room could use some touch up paint floors slightly scratched etc  however nothing that would prevent us from staying again  Main floor barrestaurant was under construction when we stayed but it looks like it will be a hipluxurious place to hang out  We ate at Holder just a few doors down from the hotel  Great meal  Hotels continental breakfast was surprisingly filling and deliciousHighly recommended for someone who enjoys unfussy service and minimalist design  
P => One of my favourite hotels I have stayed at Hotel St  Paul twice and each time have felt pampered  I love the juxtaposition of combining modern interior design with older buildings thus I adore the or of St  Paul  I first stayed at Hotel St  Paul in  when the hotel I originally had booked failed to honour my reservations  The staff at Hotel St  Paul were extremely accomodating  The situation with the other hotel was frustrating but the staff at St  Paul offered compassion and care  In the end I was more than pleased with the change in plans  In ember I got stranded in the Montreal airport after midnight unable to catch my connecting flight due to a storm  Not wanting to sleep in the airport I called Hotel St  Paul and was thrilled that they had a room  My second experience there was just as good as the first with helpful understanding staff and a beautifully upkept room  The croissants at the breakfast lounge were delicious The rooms are fresh and lofty  Clean lined design is chic but not too cold  I particularly like the dark stained hard wood floors  The washrooms feature deep soaker tubs and beautiful ble and tile If boutique style hotels are up your alley then definitely consider staying at Hotel St  Paul  While I enjoyed my time alone there since it is nestled in the heart of charming Old Montreal it would make for the perfect spot for a romantic getaway  
P => Where did everyone go I usually stay at Hotel St Paul but was disappointed this time that the restaurant is closed and the room service option is cold as someone has to deliver it from the restaurant down the road in sub zero temperatures  Also other than the great young barman the place now seems devoid of staff   especially noticable when you arrive with a heavy case and the door won t open in  c  
P => Well deserved  stars This is our rd stay at Hotel St Paul within the last  years and I must say our last stay was the best one yet  I have never bothered with write ups or comment cards but felt it was due when my wife could not stop talking about our experiences to our friends and family  Our first trip here almost  years ago was romantic and spontaneous  My wife and I organized a last minute weekend getaway to celebrate her birthday which just so happened to be while the jazz festival was taking place  We arrived and were immediately impressed with the exterior of the hotel the valet who greeted us and the lobby of this magnificent hotel  Wow Registration was quick and informative offered a map and brief rundown of the surroundings which helped alot  The room was sleek in design charming in ambience yet simplistic and minimal and very comfortable  The location was perfect with everything in walking distance  For our two evenings we relied on suggestions from the concierge and were not dissappointed  We enjoyed two evenings of culinary gems both ending with the outdoor festivities and pleasant walks back to the hotel  We found the concierge team both informative and very knowledgable  To complete a great weekend the hotel suprised us with a small bottle of champagne and strawberries with a card reading quotHappy Birthdayquot  Kudos to the hotel for gestures like that go a long wayThe one point I thought could be improved is the selection of the bed size  I enjoy the comfort of my king size bed but it seems the hotel is equipped with queens only  My wife keeps reminding me that it is not so bad to sleep closer to each other for a couple of days   shes rightOur second visit was during  of last year when we reserved  rooms as we convinced four of our closest friends to visit Montreal for the first time  We all ided to drive to Montreal and were all dumbfounded when we encountered a construction site directly in front of the hotel  Driving in the old town was horrific and terribly frustrating  We voiced our discontent and were politely upgraded so the noise would not damper our weekend  From that point after our stay was just what we expected  Two days before our arrival I had contacted the concierge Michelle who instantly sent me links to restaurants wine bars and lounges that she recommended  She then made all the reservations and also took the time to go out of her way and purchased wine and cheese so we could enjoy upon our arrival  Everything was perfect and our friends were impressed  All the staff never seize to amaze us with their desire to please  Our friends enjoyed the hotel very much and we are certain they will be back without us next time  For those interested the restaurants we enjoyed were Joe Beef and Chez LEpicier  Thank you Michelle  We also had the chance to visit Jean Talon ket St Johs Oratory and Botanical Gardens  All are accessible by subway and were explained perfectly by the concierge team  Our most recent trip which was a week before Christmas and by far the best trip yet  For starters no more construction It looks fantastic with a beautiful boardwalk running thru Old Montreal and leading towards the waterfront  Spectacular Also what we found comforting is that the team of concierges valets and doormen are all the same as our first trip to this hotel  It is very much a family and somehow we now feel part of it  Both are details that make it a pleasure to return to Hotel St Paul  Upon check in we met Steve again the jovial young valet who greeted us with an enormous smile  The time it took to complete our registration our car was parked and luggages comfortably installed in our room  To our delight we met Michelle and she instantly knowing we are food fanatics suggested le Club Chasse et Peche  Unable to book a reservation the first night we enjoyed BronteFrench Mediteranean gastronomy and jazz bar afterwards  Upstairs  A wonderful evening that we thought would be hard to beat  We were wrong The following day began with shopping and ended with a carriage ride in the old city  We were dropped off in front of Chasse et Peche and what an experience it was For anybody visiting Montreal try and book a reservation here It is well worth the price On a closing note If you planning a trip to Montreal   think strongly of staying at Hotel St Paul   we are fans because of their class sincerity and true professionalism  In todays society many hotels are similar but it is nice to have a hotel that has some real personality  Kudos again 
P => Groovy I never expected that such a modern hip looking hotel would have the top notch staff included  Usually this type of hotel has inexperienced apathetic and trageically hip staff that makes you to never go back  Not here though My experience with everyone was a surprize  They were pleasant helpful and efficient  Thanks Hotel St  Paul for a truly nice stay By the way the suite was gorgeous 
P =>  stars The Hotel St  Paul was an excellent hotel very nice design clean aesthetic very modern without the cold feeling you get in some of the trendy contemporary hotels  We were recently at the Puerta America hotel in Madrid the over the top high design hotel that has won numerous architectural awards and this hotel had a very similar vibe but where the Puerta America would sacrifice design for functionality the St  Paul made no such sacrifices Above all else the service at the hotel was second to none everyone from the front desk receptionist to the room attendant was very friendly and eager to accomodate every request  Our stay was a last minute reservation over NYE to surprise my wife and I did not have reservations anywhere  I sought the help of the concierge Eric and he jumped right in offered numerous suggestions and called almost every restaurant in town  Of course being last minute and a major holiday most restaurants were fully booked or closed but Eric was undeterred and did everything he could to get us a seating The hotel is also in a good location located in the heart of Vieux Montreal and right on Rue St  Paul where a lot of bars and restaurants are  Its also minutes away from the subway so did not need a car and we were able to use the subway and walk to most sites All in all it was a great stay and we hope to stay there again in the near future hopefully when the weather is a little warmer 
P => Great boutique hotel We stayed at St  Pauls for  nights in   For staters the setting in Vieux Montreal is romantic  Then you walk into this cozy modern minimalist hotel with a captivating fireplace and you feel welcomed to the city We loved our room with hardwood floors incredible dark chocolates at bedtime and soft jazz playing when you entered  The breakfast of cheeses fruits and baked goods each morning reminded me of Eurpoe The staff was very helpful even when they goofed  We were given wrong directions to a playhouse and missed the show  They sent up a bottle of champagne and refunded us the show tickets The Cube restaurant seemed to be a happening place on the weekend  We enjoyed dinner there and loved the espresso tini from the bar We found lots of nice little touches at the hotel such as complementary umbrellas newspapers and the turndown service  St  Pauls was convenient to most things with lots of museums restaurants bars and the metro within close walking distance We will certainly stay here again  
P => Great Service I was given less than  weeks to organize a client event for  clients and  staff and was recommended to the Hotel St  Paul  From start to finish the service I received was impeccable  Genevieve our corporate planner was a superstar  She thought of things I had forgotten and just took care of them  Alex at the front door was a delight   so willing and helpful and attentive  And the food from Diane at Cube was spectacular  I totally recommend the Hotel St  Paul as ideal for a chic hip corporate event  It carries the cachet of a high end boutique hotel with a very reasonable price tag And the rooms  Wow  As the planner I received a complimentary upgrade to the Penthouse floor with its gorgeous vaulted  foot ceilings  My room was visually stunning with ebony wood floors and the tallest windows Ive ever seen in a hotel room with wooden shutters instead of the ubiquitous blackout curtains  And the bathroom    OMG  The tub  I could swim in it  Seriously  I only wish I could have stayed more than one night and have had more free time to hang out in my room For the actual event we had Salle  amp  as well as a reception area in the nd Floor Atrium area  And what a knockout it was  From the hip lounge music to the chic amp attentive waitstaff to the amazing food our clients native Montrealers as well as the high standards of the principals of our organization   all were completely impressed  I did not hear one single complaint or criticism and with an event of this magnitude amp expectation level that is high praise indeed The only thing I could possible complain about would be the road construction currently taking place in old Montreal that made it difficult for our clients to attend our event  But thats hardly the fault of the Hotel St  Paul  This property is fantastic and I give it a gigantic thumbs up  
P => Felt more expensive than it was Superb hotel despite the road works ongoing outside Loved the or and the contemporary feel  The bed was super comfortable the room sizeable and it had a fabulous bathroom with a two person bath tub Buffet continental breakfast was good value and was available until  am  Location for old town and port couldnt be beaten Well be back  
P => Pleasantly surprised  I was a bit hesitant to stay at this hotel because it looked rather trendy and ultra modern and I am one of those people who like classic and old fashioned or  My wife and I ultimately chose it because of its location  We were pleasantly surpised  Yes it is ultra modern  The minute you walk in it puts you in mind of the W Hotel chain though less pretentious  Very modern very chic  But once you get passed that assuming you dont like modern it is a very likeable hotel  First off the staff is amazingly helpful The valet took care of our car immediately which was great since we arrived after midnight  The front desk was very helpful offering suggestions on places to eat places to site see and where to find ATM machines  When we were checking out we wanted to have them hold onto our luggage while we went and grabbed brunch at a local restaurant  We didnt even have to make this request of them since the attendant behind the desk beat us to the punch and asked us if wed like for the hotel to hold our luggage while we got something to eat he even recommended a great little jazz joint around the corner from the hotel  The staff at the St Paul was exceptional As for the rooms   they are pretty modern and have a minimalist or  Though I prefer classic the rooms were indeed comfortable and clean  Loved the dark wood floors  There was a large flat panel television with all the stations you could want  The bathroom was stately and had a deep bathtub capable of comfortably fitting two people  There was also a nice work area off of the foot of the bed  It was great  To add that extra touch they had a very modern cd playerradio that was softly playing classical music when we first entered the room  After having spent  hours on the road prior to arriving it is extremely relaxing to walk into a clean comfortable room with soothing music playing in the background  I loved that added tocuh of comfort The location is hard to beat  We were within easy walking distance of Old Port the Old City and China Town  You are near to all these locations without being right in the midst of the crowd that you find at those locations  Thus you get a quiet spot to rest in and are only a  to  minutes walk from all the action  Couldnt be situated any better  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the St  Paul and would definitely stay there again  
P => Cool and Convenient Very nice hotel located just on the edge of old city  The staff were professional kind and helpful when asked  The or is simple modern and clean  The dark hallways take some getting used to though  My only complaint    very uncomfortable fold out sofa bed in the jr  suite and some question about whether the sheets on the bed were fresh  There was a mysterious sunflower seedDont let that scare you off  Its worth a stay to experience great contemporary design  
P => Very nice but noisy My friend and I stayed at the St  Paul for two nights and found it very posh and well located  The lobby is small but very cool with an open ble fireplace and lounging chairs  Our first room was small and its window faced the fire escape  We also had the misfortune of having a loud couple a few doors down   we could hear EVERYTHING they were doing in addition to peole knocking on others doors people on cell phones in he hallway etc  I would say the hotel had less sound proofing than your typical chain hotel which is frustrating  The room itself was minimal yet cozy with faux fur blanket flat screen tv a huge mirror leaning against the wall and nice bathroom  The breakfast was good too Our second night we switched to a larger room with a window overlooking McGill Street  It had a different configuration but was also sleek yet comfortable  
P => Unique and Cultured Hotel St  Paul is a unique place filled with culture and style  The attendees helped me with my baggage and parked my car in their open air garage right after I pulled up  Upon being helped in the Hotel I was dazzled by the fireplace in the lobby  The concierge were very nice throughout my stay and actually helped me find directions to the La Ronde amusement park for the fireworks competition Argentina  The penthouse that I booked was impressive in the fact that it resembled a New York City Studio sized apartment  The high cielings along with tall windows are impressive and the lighting in the room was unique  Inside features are minimal and simplistic to the point that it encourages you to relax on the very comfortable bed  Please set the alarm   hehehe    The LCD TV also adds to the simplistic nature of the environment  The only downside was that I couldnt find any drawers for my clothes though there is a closet to hang my clothes  For those who like more room go and book the suites in advance  Please bring a laptop if you have one since internet there is complimentary and it really helps with finding directions to all your destinations  The Hotel St Paul is in a strategic location where you can hit most of the scenes on St Paul Street and the Harbor  Restaurants and Souveneirs Stores are abundant around that area and truly adds to the magic of living there  I recommend eating at the Papallion for the Salmon and THE KEG for the Steaks  Also try this ice cream shop near the Hotel on St Paul Street  Its a million flavors with smoothness to back it up   Bottom line St  Paul is definitely an experience and I would recommend it for anyone looking for unique tasteful comfort  quotBook and Restquot 
P => Trendy  We just spent five nights in the St Paul and had a lovely stay  The hotel is in a good location in the old town and is about a  min walk up to the main shopping area of Rue St Catherine  The hotel is chic and minimalist in style  The room was very comfortable and kept very clean during our stay  We have no complaintsl  You should not be disappointed with your stay at this hotel  The hotels restaurant seems quite expensive though  Theres plenty of places to eat in Montreals old town and up in the new town     
P => Amazing anniversary stay My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel St  Paul for our th anniversary in ch and it was lovely  From the moment we arrived the staff were nothing but courteous and helpful  Having told them that we were there for our anniversary they made sure to make our trip extra special  We wanted to have a nice dinner together and the hotel staff delivered with a great recommendation Bronte  Not only that but they told the restaurant that we were having an anniversary dinner so when we arrived the hostess greeted us at the door and congratulated us  For the rest of the evening the waitstaff came by with little treats sent from the chef in honor of our special day All in all a great stay and while it was a little more than we would usually spend for a special occasion it was well worth it  Highly recommended for a romantic getaway  I cant thank them enough for making sure that my boyfriend and I had an anniversary to remember 
P => Fantastic Hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel St Paul for  days in e   We were very impressed from the outset  The room was large well equipped and although orated in a minimalist style was very comfortable  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly especially Eric  A Continental Breakfast was included in the rate and was very enjoyable  We made use of the valet parking which cost  CAD and allows you to take the car in and out as often as required  There are some roadworks taking place outside the hotel but this could barely be heard within the hotel  All in all a super hotel that I would recommend without hesitation  
P => Great Hotel excellent staff and superb restaurant We stayed at the Hotel St  Paul for  days and had a wonderful time  We also were confused about the complaints of other reviewers Hotel St  Paul has a great lobby area Not like a Chain hotel  Its small cool fireplace great seating  They have a small bar outside of Cube Restaurant which makes great drinks Everytime we asked for suggestions from anyone in the hotel they were   professional and tailored their suggestions to our likesdislikes  We have stayed at top notch hotels around the US and Europe and we felt this was a great place and was unique  We stayed in the ior Suite and it was spacious and had a nice bathroom If you have the money   GO TO CUBE  We are from Chicago and have been to a lot of top notch restaurants this place is one of the best Montreal is under major construction in the summer however nothing is effected by it The streets around every hotel are gettin made over so dont make this a concern Go to Newtown Restaurant Olive and Gourmando block from hotel and any cafebar in downtown  Have a Great Time and Au Revoir  
P => The Perfect Place to stay in Montreal This is an amazing hotel Fabulous and chic interior  Beautiful rooms and superb room extras like lavender perfume Cube is not to be missed  some of the best food I have had and I have been to many five star gourmet places  Foie gras was heavenlyThis hotel is in a terrific location   do not miss Olivo and Gourmando  The service is impecable  I really dont understand anyones complaints in the past  If you are chic and fashionable and love comtempory luxury this is the place for you If you are into old fashioned frumpy hotels with stuffy personalities then be montreal is not for you  
P => Treated like a member of the family Beautiful room super helpful staff great location  I agree with fellow traveler the bed felt kind of hard while sitting on it BUT sleeping on it I woke up refreshed  Some of the best sleep Ive had  You need to give the beds a chance This hotel is right at the edge of the Old Port and in a great location  You can walk everywhere and the loungebreakfast were great  I would stay here every time I went to Montreal  Its great 
P => Cozy friendly hip and unpretentious My boyfriend and I have stayed at the Hotel St Paul twice in the last two years and it is always a highlight of our trip to Montreal  In fact we are planning another summer trip to Quebec and the St Paul is on the itinerary  The rooms are chic  minimalist but not cold the tub is TOTALLY AMAZING and fits two people a nice treat after long walks in the city especially when coupled with a Lush bath bomb and the complimentary breakfast has many options tea coffee juice fruit cereal toast pastries yogurt cheese cold cuts etc and is delicious  This is not your typical quotfree continental breakfastquot featuring watery java and forlorn dried out donuts The staff is friendly accommodating and welcoming something of a rarity in the boutique hotel business in my experience anyway  I always recommend this hotel because I feel that its combination of style and hospitality cannot be beat  
P => Friendly service ok room Stayed there for one night  The entire staff are very friendly   couldnt seem to do enough for you I had a basic room   it was ok very clean etc The TV was small and outdated If you are looking to stay in Old Montreal its a well located Hotel The breakfast was included in the rate and was very nice  
P => A bit disappointing We spent two nights at this hotel and actually we were a little disappointed  Let me start with the positives in spite of the very modern cubic  design element  present throughout the hotel the atmosphere in the lobby was warm and cosy with a very original large gas fireplace but no place to sit really  We also liked the restaurant and the bar was fun  The staff while seemingly all quite young and a bit inexperienced were on the whole very friendly However the room we originally booked Penthouse Suite was not available due to reation and we were upgraded to a ior Suite  We were slightly disappointed in this room it was actually a bit small especially when we closed the sliding doors between the  living room  and the bedroom  Very little closet space  Another point was that housekeeping didn t come our way until around  p m  By that time we already had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door because we were exhausted from the trip and needed to sleep  So our room never got cleaned on the day we were there  It is one of my pet peeves that a really well run hotel should be able to have housekeeping clean all the rooms in the morning or in any case before  PM or so or have some system for their guests to indicate when they would like their room cleaned  Another problem concerned breakfast on our first morning there was some sort of  crisis  with the breakfast the guy at reception was very apologetic and it only became available from  AM although it should have been there from   Due to jetlag we were up very early and very hungry so we wandered through a cold and frosty Montreal to wind up at MacDonald s the only place in the area to be open at  on a Saturday morning Sumizing I think this hotel offers too little for the price compared to certain other hotels in Montreal  We also stayed at St  Sulpice   for comments see under that hotel  In addition an acquaintance with whom we were travelling also spent the first  nights at St  Paul and later spent  night at the Auberge Bonaparte   he was surprised at how much better the room and service were at Bonaparte and at about half the priceFinally a note regarding location the hotels location on the edge of Old Montreal isnt bad  Everything was within walking distance  But we preferred the location of e g  St  Sulpice Auberge Bonaparte Nelligan etc  which were really in the midst of Old Montreal  
P => Travelor Beware   VERY CHEAP AND RUDE STAFF I would never stay at the St  Paul again and would warn friends from staying there  Do yourself a favor and stay at the LeGermain or Ritz for just a few dollars more  The St  Paul is neither luxurious nor trendy My girlfriend I just came back from our annual weekend trip to Montreal and we thought wed try out a new hotel the St  Paul  What a cheap hotel This hotel tries very hard to be trendy but fails miserably  The quottrendyquot bathroom looks more like Uncle Louies unfished basement with ugly tiles and the sink being so small and so close the faucet its nearly impossible not to get water everywhere  Even the soap is gross  The beds are uncomfortable the or is guady the light in the elevator is on top of a deers head   is this really what trendy is the TVs are tiny and practically on the floor and their complementary breakfast is stale and nasty we left and went to a brunch place to get a real breakfast  The bathroom only had two regular towels and one hand towel which is fine but not for the price you pay to stay here  We asked for more and they took a nice hour deliving us an extra towel  The bar downstairs is probably smaller than your closet The Hotel Staff YELLED at my girlfriend  We already checked in for the first night so we were willing to stay there but wanted to go to another hotel for the rest of our stay  The Staff was not having it  and they were being very rude about it  When we tried to reason with them the guy at reception started yelling at my girlfriend that we were going to get charged no matter what because we booked the hotel online through St  Pauls website and didnt book it over the phone  Apparently if we booked over the phone we could have cancelled  Should there really be a disconnect here between booking online versus over the phone Its not like we used hotels or anything we used the hotels website And should a hotel staff ready be yelling at their customersThe staff is also clueless  When we asked for good restaurants nearby it was our first time staying on that side of town they were useless and couldnt really tell us anything  They didnt attempt to look it up for us either  The one thing I did like about the hotel was their ironing board  Thats about it  
P => Great Experience I stayed at the St  Paul for  nights this month and had an excellent experience  The hotel is minimalist and very very comfortable  My room was large and well furnished  Service is tremendous   the staff are very friendly and helpful  My superior room was quite large  Rates are very reasonable for this type of boutique hotel The advantages of the hotels location might not be obvious to those who dont know the city  But as a former local I eciate how the St  Paul is central yet away from the downown crush  It sits on the edge of Old Montreal amid some of the most beautiful architecture in Canada  Access to the downtown area is very easy   minute walk  Some of the best restaurants in the city are in the neighborhood I highly recommend the St  Paul and intend to stay there again in the future  
P => Modern Elegant Refreshing The St  Paul Hotel was true class  My husband and I went for a  day weekend and were extremely pleased  We arrived at the hotel on Friday night at pm  From the moment we arrived we were pampered  The doorman welcomed us with a smile and eagerness to serve us in any way  The reception staff was wonderful Very informative and attentive  We were so hungry after a  hour drive and Eric presented us with  restaurant menus and when we chose he called the restaurant to make the reservation for us  We at at the Mondavi on St  Paul and it was incredibleOur room was on the Penthouse level  It was spectacular from the moment we entered  The or was truly modern minimalist  It was not a cold atmosphere but serene and soothing  The  foot ceilings giant floor to ceiling window and view of the city was a cosmopolitan delight  The ble bathroom and giant bathtub was a treat  The room was large and streamline  The designer Ana Barello is absolute talent  She transformed an old historical building into a modern oasis  We looked forward to being in our room as much as visiting beautiful Old Montreal The location was perfect We were on the very last street of Old Montreal which meant it was located outside of the bustle but just a  min walk from the historical buildings shops and ina  Old Montreal in the summer is just beautifulI would recommend the St Paul to anyone  The price is right  You will be happy you visited  
P => My second visit and WOW Ladies and Gentlemaen this hotel is what  star service is all about From the moment we arrived we were greeted and welcomed  It was like the movies  He was waiting for us with an umbrella and took care of all the baggage and said that it would be in the room shortly  The service at the reception was phenominal It was quick and painless  And they also gave us so much info about the events in the city festivals and things to do  We were then pointed in the right direction to our room  The room you must know is clean and impeccable Some  say they are cold but if you are openminded they are beautiful What you see on the website is what you get  Shortly after we settled in the doorman arrived with our luggage and an envelope from the concierge  He had gone to the trouble of printing out  or so restaurants around Montreal  The staff took care of all our reservations and transportation  Excellent service The two nights at Hotel St Paul were absolutely wonderful It you want a hotel that treats all their guests like kings and queens look no further   BULLSEYE 
P => Chic AND friendly The Hotel St  Paul in Old Montreal is a wonderful place  It has the usual chic high design look that is the norm in boutique hotels these days with the added attraction of an incredibly friendly staff I think we can fairly say this isnt always the norm in such hotels  The room was beautiful and comfortable the breakfast was great lots of fresh fruit about  or  kinds of cheese and various rolls breads and pastries and the location is perfect for a romantic weekend in a great little city  Youre right there in the old city a very walkable old place filled with restaurants and cafes nice places to shop etc  We never made it to the gym so I cant comment on that but we did find a great trail that runs along the canal that is perfect for a morning run or stroll  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Perfect Hotel for us For two graphic designers on their honeymoon this hotel was perfect  We loved the or the simplicity the friendly staff and the lovely breakfast provided every morning at no cost  It was relitively quiet except for the occational morning construction down the street  There was good sushi near by but other than that not a lot of restaurant options right on Rue McGill  Old Montreal Notre Dame Basilica and a view of Habitat  were a short walk away  Hotel St  Paul is a few blocks from the subway which was no problem for us but I could see how it could be too far for some  We loved our honeymoon in Montreal largly due to our stay at Hotel St  Paul  We would stay there again  
P => Minimalist Montreal Stayed at the hotel for four nights in early e  When we arrived at hotel we were greeted with soft lighting classical music truffles and a selection of sparkling and flat water in our room  or   stark minimalist no clutter did not find it cold at allRoom   had a superior queen which was very spacious I found the bed a bit hard but my boyfriend loved it  The bathroom was spacious and very clean  The tub could fit three people Food   excellent selection and quality both at breakfast and at lunch did not eat dinner at hotelAnnoyances   had to request a shower cap which is standard in most high end hotels  We had a business meeting arranged in the breakfast room  We had to clear our own tables and even wipe them down while three hotel staff just watched us do soAmbiance   the hotel was not very busy so we really didnt get a vibe there is always soft music playing in the hotel   electronic jazz bossaa  Had a few drinks at the bar one night but they were nothing special Location   best in town  Close to shopping entertainment and Old Montreal Overall would go back if the price was right  
P => We found it to be very appealing This was our first time to Montreal  My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night and absolutely loved it It was a bit pricey but it was worth it  The staff was so friendly and helpful  The design was so modern and appealing  It was definetly a stress free night  My only complaint is that there is no hot tub 
P => Location location location The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and accomodating  The parking across the street certainly made life simple  We enjoyed the location as it was not only easy to walk uphill and get to the center of the old city but also easy to access the highway to go out to Ile dOrleans and St  Anne de Beaupre  
P => OK But Not Great My husband and I visited Montreal for the first time for our th anniversary in mid tember  We enjoy trying boutique hotels so thought wed try the Hotel St  Paul  We booked in advance and with the exchange rate we stayed in a  room suite bed room dining room and living room for  days for a pretty good price  Good location by the older part of Montreal which is somewhat touristy but there is some great things to see as well historical buildings architecture etc  so much so that I prefer this part of town  And one day we walked to the downtown area where all the cool restaurants and clubs are   nice walk The hotel itself    lobby was nice sorta cool club feel  The staff was nice  Good breakfast in the morning  The rooms were pretty big or at least ours was  worst part of the trip   the bed was the hardest I have ever slept in     in my entire life  After the first night I woke up with a back ache and tried to find another hotel all were booked or we would have left  If the beds were more comfortable wed consider returning to the Hotel St  Paul but since we dont expect that happening well probably go with the newly opened W and their heavenly bed for a good night sleep which is a couple of blocks from the Hotel St  Paul    before we try another boutique in Montreal  
P => Spectacular design phenomenal restaurant We stayed two nights in ober  and found the hotel to be spectactularly beautiful  Every detail was designed to perfection including indirect colored lighting small tile bathroom walls alabaster fireplace in lobby bed canopies wood window covers with leather pulls  Location is just fine a few short blocks from the center of Old Montreal  Staff were very friendly and helpful  The Cube restaurant is phenomenal  Everyone should go there for at least one meal  Our room lacked comfortable seating though and the desk was too small to be functional  The beds are harder than most but the bedding is above average  If you appreciate design and are tired of the visual clutter found in many hotels and dont mind sacrificing a little comfort this is for you  
P => For snobs only  stayed a week on   If youre eager to spend big bucks on an hotel with run down rooms terrible maintenance and crappy equipment this is for you  I was drawn to the alledged modern style of the hotel and the old Montreal location but in the end I got a small room which I found very dirty a faux fur body pillow with stains a broken curtain a defective TV remote and a way too high bathtub    that is an issue for people with challenged mobility  Service wise once the maid forgot my towels another time the kleenex another time the soap     should have I stayed longer As for the location although its near the Old Port its not the best part  The surroundings are industrialworks like  If you want a nice hotel with a more attractive location theres the Nelligan or the Hotel XIX siecle near Notre Dame basilique  The only really positive things  the abundant continental breakfast and the very nice amp helpful staff  
P => Stylish and comfortable    good location for Vieux Montreal and Downtown We spent  nights at the St Paul this month and had a comfortable and enjoyable stay  It has to be remembered that this is a city hotel with the pros and cons that go with that  Having stayed the week before in New York City we were impressed by the room size not huge but we had a penthouse queen and the high ceiling was nice chic atmosphere and attention to detail  NYC did not compare for a similar price  It wasnt cheap but we got a reasonable deal on the St Paul website I have to say that some of the desk and door staff were extremely helpful giving us recommendations on restaurants while others were slightly more aloof  I would disagree with the reviewer who said that a downside is its location on the very edge of Vieux Montreal  It only takes  minutes on foot to cross to the opposite end of Vieux Montreal and who wants to be right in the heart of the bustle and quottouristyquot shops in any case Its location was also very handy for access to Downtown  Tip if you can go during the week we found the hotel quiet and no problems getting a table at breakfast Plus side nice attention to detail a beautiful conversion friendly staff Minus side Guest rooms could have done with a few more creature comforts to take off the quotharshnessquot of the or eg a lounging chair larger TV  The gym was sparse and one morning we were there no machines were available ok this is really a small detail but if they offer a gym it might as well have a couple more machines  The stereo with classical music is a nice touch but was only every switched on for us for our arrival and no turn down the second night we were thereAll in all a slightly different boutique style hotel in an excellent location at reasonable value for money  
P => Nice  But would not recommend it I just got back Montreal and our stay at Hotel St  Paul  Below are reasons why I would not recommend the hotel It is on the utmost outskirts of quotOld Montrealquot Not in the center of all of the action persay Hotel is ultra modern almost to the point of feeling cold and impersonal Rooms are extremely small and sparce No concierge   front desk doubles as the concierge Breakfast is pretty good but the dining room is very small and there were never clean tables for us to sit at   we always had to wait or sit at a dirty one and wait for someone to clean it up Television was tinyIt sounds pretty bad but it is an average hotel but there are much better choices in old montreal  Le Saint Suplice Hotel Nelligan Place De Armes  
P => Loved the St  Paul Great Old Montreal Boutique Hotel  Hip modern or  We had a ior suite that was quite large with great views  Huge bathroom with incredible toiletries  Cube Restaurant in the hotel is another plus  Will definitely go back 
P => A Great Stay Upon arrival at the St  Paul we were so pleased  The first impression of the hotel is very crisp clean and modern  The front desk staff and the valet were above and beyond accomodating  We took a Jr  Suite and since it was a holiday the price was higher than usual but worth it  We were in room  which was very very quiet  The room had sparse but modern eclectic furniture and all the ammenities that you could desire  The rooms are not big but the space is well laid out and the furniture is very comfortable  The bed was firm which is a nice change from the fluff beds at other hotels   we had a problem getting out of this one in the morning  The bathroom was the selling point    a tub big enough for two and erate sinks  We had dinner at CUBE which is in the lobby and the food was eclectic and very good    I would reccomend this hotel highly  
P => Doesnt Live Up to the Hype Stylish hotel but ultimately disappointing  The location is good and the rooms are attractive but there are several more pleasing boutique hotels in Montreal  The St  Paul doesnt manage to strike that elusive balance between comfort and style  If a hipster ambience is your top priority then this is  be the hotel for you  Better service and more comfort are available eslewhere in the city

P => Not going back NegativesBathroom Probably the worst part   tiny the flimsy door didnt close all the way and the toilet didnt flush on the first try  had to call management  Also extremely thin towels paper thin so bring your own And dont expect to use the Shampoo and Conditioner it is very low quality  Beds Comfortable but very thin sheets with holes and some stains  Overall room and hotel dark and gloomy with a musty smell Kitchen turned me off from wanting to prepare any food in it  small awkward simple and lousy repairs done in an attempt to quotupdatequot itPositives A plus was that some rooms have a living room so if you are with more than one person you have  rooms TV in lving room  Fridge was helpful Parking for about  or  a dayLocation is good  actually its the only one in the area which is why we got stuck at the Terrasse  Next to the shops superkets and subway in the areaAlsoIf you have to go there get breakfast from next door at Au Pain Dore  the bread pastries and coffee are all great and highly recommended Also Avoid Second Cup across the street 
P => Perfect for working while relaxing This is not the location for somebody looking for high class accommodations but it certainly met my expectations and my needs and my budget I stayed here for one week at the beginning of ust  I was attending an academic meeting for which I had to prepare a tutorial on the final day and I also had to complete some other work  I needed to spend quite a bit of time in the room doing work on my laptop  In the past some hotel rooms have not afforded good working conditions   I was thrilled by the set up of my suite at Hotel Terrasse Royale  I was in room  overlooking Cote des Neiges   it was perfect for people watching while I worked  The suite had an entryway complete with coat closet a ent sized bathroom tub with shower a fairly small bedroom large bed dresser  end tables walk in closet equipped with iron and ironing board a living room  seater couch arm chair desk with chair table with  chairs coffee table tv and a kitchenette full size microwave small stove  burners but only  large narrow apartment size fridge with freezer coffee maker kettle toaster bar sink and all the utensils and dinnerware to make it work  The room was looking a little worn but it was very clean and functional  I highly recommend this for anybody with a longer stay in Montreal  It was very affordable particularly as you really dont need to eat out with the kitchen setup  Within a block of the hotel there was a full size grocery store a smaller high end fruitveggiebreaddeligourmet shop and a very reasonably priced fresh fruit and veggie stand  There are also many small restaurants as well as some chains St  Huberts Nickels but I only ate out a couple of times  I much preferred to cook myself something and relax in front of the tv before getting back to work  The hotel has a small laundry room downstairs   it cost   for the washer   for the dryer and I was able to buy detergent for the load for  from the front desk who also could have made change if I needed it The location was wonderful   just a block away from the Cote de Neiges metro station on the blue line  so access to most areas of the city was an easy ride  The neighbourhood has several interesting things as well   Mount Royal the oratory etc  The front desk staff were great  I arrived very early and the only room ready did not have a kitchenette as booked   upon looking at the length of my stay  nights the staff suggested that I wait until another room was ready  They kept my bag for me and I went across the road to the Second Cup where I had internet access a scone and some great tea sitting in the atrium in the back  Before returning I did a quick grocery shop  The room was ready by  and I was able to check in  They also helped me figure out when to leave for an early morning flight got me up in time and arranged for the cab to the airport  Always service with a smile I was so impressed with the comfort of my stay I re booked there for later this week when I will be attending a conference located downtown  Although I will have to take the metro to and from it I think that the comfortable environment really feeling at the end of the day like I am coming home because I have all the amenities of home is worth the travel time particularly with the metro being so handy  For my budget any hotel downtown that I could have afforded would have been in the    star range  One downside is that as it is not located downtown so transportation from the airport is not ideal  On the way to the hotel I took the  airport bus to downtown and then took the metro to the hotel took about  minutes   on the way back I took a cab for  in the wee hours of the morning so no traffic  The metro in Montreal is great but its not very accessible   most stations dont appear to have elevators or escalators so if you are toting some bags be aware that you  have to tote them up and down stairs  Im going back next week and will stick to a cab  
P => Wonderful experience I was a little hesitant due to the mixed reviews I had read here but wow The room was clean comfortable and better than I had imagined I was staying with my mother who found the bed too soft for her back and once she had expressed this to the manager he immediately gave us a new room with a mattress that met her needs  The staff was mostly friendly and courteous with the exception of the guy working nights on the desk and it was great  It is very close to everything and anything you could need or want with the exception of Tim Hortons  Not a big deal to me but for my mother and my husband its an obstacle which can be overcome  My mother bought coffees on the way back from the Eaton Centre and brought them to the hotel and my husband is planning to bring a one cup coffee maker and some Tims coffee grounds with us when we return later this month  There is a Shoppers Drug t with wonderful staff just up the street a St  Jeromes Chicken and Ribs next door to Terrasse Royale and a Subway  A Second Cup is across the street as is a  hour grocery store  Down the street is a fruit ket and it is within walking distance of Jewish General Hospital  DO NOT eat at Nickels  It is a s diner across from the hotel  We thought it would be great but the food is awful and it is hideously overpriced There is a little coffee shop across from the hotel not Second Cup which serves food and it was wonderful and not badly priced at all  There is a bus stop right outside Shoppers and you can get a transfer to take you on the subway to the Eaton Centre  For two people it cost only    Not badThe other way past Jewish General is a mall of sorts with Zellers and Canadian Tire in it  Very dirty Not at all what youd want to shop in but if you need something from there   I am going back to Jewish General for surgery later this month and we will definately be staying at Terrasse Royale  
P => As advertised As the other reviewers had indicated the hotel is well located near a subway stop and has indoor parking its tight maneuvering at a modest fee  The neighborhood around it was very nice and there were convenient restaurants and a superket within a block  It was a great location unless you needed to be within walking distance of downtown  But the subway being so nearby makes even this irrelevant The hotel looked clean as well  The only issue was my wifes distress at the quotlookquot of the room  It had older furniture and was not enticing although the suite was very spacious   two full size beds in one room plus a sofa bed in the other  There was a small kitchen and the bathroom was ok  The furniture was dated the curtains walls etc  were ordinary etc  and that was enough for her to object   strenuously  We had to leave So we went to another hotel that had a smaller room and was a smoking room which smelled  The subway was  blocks away but the hotel had a shuttle  However the lobby and furniture were very good and the parking lot was ample and outdoors  She preferred this hotel much more  Oh well   So if you care about space and comfort and value and convenience Hotel Terrasse Royal is for you  If you care about appearances its not  
P => OK Stay Stayed at the Terrasse Royale for  nights  I booked this property based upon the good reviews on this site  The hotel is in a fantastic neighborhood with grocery stores pharmacy cafes  restaurants and the metro all within easy walking distance  Parking was available under the hotel and there is a washerdryer in the basement very convenient  Our apartment had a nice little balcony living room with cable TV small full kitchen bathroom and arate closed bedroom with a HUGE closet which I loved  It was not however the cleanest  The carpet was so grimy that my feet were black after I walked across it a few times  Bought flip flops  The worst was the pubic hair I found in the fridge right after we arrived I figured that cleaning staff must have used the same cloth to wipe out the fridge as was used in the bathroom  I had to clean the kitchen  Positives the price was very cheap for a one bedroom apt  and the neighborhood was great  If we stay here again I will ask to see the room before checking in  
P => Great location not so great room  I agree with previous reviewers  location is great but rooms are problematic  Our room had the most horrible smell  I cant imagine what it was  Since we visited on a very windy day an open window helped a bit  Another reviewer mentioned that the bathrooms are quotweirdquot  Our room which was huge and sparsely furnished had a toilet and sink on one end and the showerbath on the other   completely arate rooms on either side of the suite  I suspect this building was an elderly care facility before it was a hotel  Also our room was supposed to have a kitchenette and was certainly large enough to accommodate one but did not  Since the hotel was full we were stuck with our stinky weird room  We arrived at pm and were told the parking area was full  Good thing for us we found a spot on the street  The price is good the location is good but the place needs to be cleaned and updated  
P => Couldnt beat it We loved it  The neighbohood was safe lively and busy all the time and convenient  With the metro just down the street from the hotel it was about  minutes to get into the city center  I was just there with my spouse and  year old child and should we go back to Montreal again we will stay there  The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were fine    especially considering the price  It was a good place for a family with young children because as all parents know you cant take them to restaurants every night  The kitchen was equiped well enough for us to enjoy a simple meal at home after a long day of being tourists  The superket across the street open  hours made it all the easier  
P => Great location room was below average The positives The location is perfect  There is anything you could want or need within a  minute walk  Including the subway into the heart of town  The parking garage is the best place for your car to stay for the duration of your visit unless you are leaving town  I couldnt possilby explain how great the location is though without writing for days  We had so much fun exploring the stores cafes college cathedral etc  etc  etc  The staff was polite  Completely quotfunctionalquot but very polite  The room was quite large The negatives I read reviews here which called this place a hidden gem and a superior value  I wouldnt come close to calling it that  It was extremely plain  The room was very poorly lit and very drab  The furniture was quite old not in that quotwow look at the beautiful antiquequot way    but in the quotwow did they buy that a yard salequot sort of way  The kitchenette wasnt clean although I had no need or desire to use it  The bathroom was weird  I know that isnt very descriptive but it was weird  It was clean but it was almost like it was added much later or something  It didnt fit and it was difficult to even move around in there speaking as a thin person I cant imagine a heavy person being in there  The bed wasnt very comfortable It could be a cultural difference but the staff wasnt very helpful  They were polite and nice  They just did ONLY what you asked and it was very perfunctory  There was no warmth and they didnt speak unless spoken to  We chalked that up to cultural differences but I probably wouldve moved past the boring old room if the staff had wowed me with charm you know youve done it    stayed somewhere that was a  and youve been quotwowedquot into remembering it as a  by the service  Instead it was a vanilla room was accompanied with vanilla service  Thus the vanilla rating  
P => Very good value The Terrasse Royale has seen better days and it is short on upscale amenities But it is very comfortable clean and the limited service is excellent  WIFI in rooms The suiites are well furnished armchair desk the beds are comfortable the kitchens adequate with very limited implements  glasses one pot  My room had a balcony which unfortunately overlooked a totally dismal quotback of restaurantsquot landscape with expected ventilation noises  Room was very quiet at night though Service was very good when going out in the morning I reported a leak at the tap in the bathroom the whole tap assembly had been changed when returned at noon Location is very good for those wanting to cook meals which judging by the absence of smells very few did  hr  superket across the street  Also hr pharmacy  Metro one block away Variety of restaurants on C te des Neiges  Not great but adequate roast chicken chain StHubert next door  Lots of coffeesandwich quotbarsquot Second Cup Van Houtte Br lerie  East India Company restaurant at the end of C te des Neiges is passable Excellent value for moderate budget alll in all  
P => Great Stay Stayed here in ember and loved it  It is away from most of the other hotels in Montreal but that was fine with me since it was very close to a Metro station so getting around town was easy The room was big clean and the small kitchen was great for making your own breakfast and saving some money  The area is near St  Johs Oratory a little bit away from downtown but the area had plenty of restaurants cafes and had much more going on than I thought it would  They have off street parking underneath the hotel which is good since I didnt see anyplace else to park Highly reccommended  
P => Great place to stay Being unfamiliar with Montreal I was hesitant to stay in a neighborhood as opposed to downtown but boy am I glad I did  Hotel Terrasse Royale is in an excellent location in the Cote des Neiges neighborhood  Whereas downtown is dark and pretty isolated at night my husband and I could step out the hotel lobby in the evenings and stroll up and down the street  Its a lively area with lots of people walking and shopping at all hours  There are at least two  hour cafes across the street a grocery pharmacy and fruitfromagerie as well  Theres an outdoor ket down the block and the metro subway is a couple blocks That said the hotel itself is very nice  These are large studio apartments  bedrooms and  bedroom efficiencies  We stayed a week in the studio for about  canadian including tax  The room was huge compared to standard hotel rooms  It had a very comfy king sized bed a sitting room with a couch and chair and tv a walk in closet a little kitchen with micro toaster sink and little fridgefreezer plus plates silverware etc  The bathroom was standard  Most importantly for me at least is that the hotel is spotless Im basically a freak about hotel beds mostly grossed out at your standard  and  star hotels  Not here The linens were soft and crisp the mattress was pillow top and the pillows were all lined under the pillow cases  The bottom sheet was well tucked around the mattress I hate when you can see the mattress  There was daily maid service and they had no problem sending up extra pillows The staff at the front desk were real friendly and helpful  A bonjour or bon soir and then proceed in English  The whole of the city is bilingual without hesitation Parking was more convenient than any hotel Ive ever been in honestly  Downstairs beneath the building   an automatic door directly on Cote des  Neiges  Only  a day with in and out privileges  I did take a look at the larger suites before leaving they were full up with a bus tour when we checked in and the staff offered to let us switch rooms when they tour cleared out but we were so happy with the studio we stayed put  The larger rooms would be great for couples travelling together or travelling with kids The only negative I heard was from another American couple staying in one of the front suites with the balcony that they could hear the traffic at night but that it wasnt too bad  My husband and I were in a side room with a view of the sunset and partial view of the street and slept with the windows wide open and didnt notice the street noise at all There is a cafe off the lobby which is convenient for breakfast  Theres a bookstore and cafe next door and many stores and restaurants right on the blocks surrounding the hotel  The St Johs oratory is in view from the lobby entrance hence the bus tours  The Vietnamese restaurant a couple doors down is fantastic And be sure to visit the several large kets such as the Jean Talon ket for a great experience all easily accessible from the metro or by car We navigated by the lonely planet guidebook and it was simple All in all Ill never stay anywhere else when visiting Montreal  The rooms are spotless the staff friendly the parking convenient and cheap and the neighborhood is safe and bustling  A real Montreal experience  
P => A jewel in the midst of a multi ethnic community The hotel is perfectly located with coffee shops and restaurants which stay open late a  hour big grocery store a wonderful bakery with freshly baked breads and pastries right outside its front doorFor the researcher and avid reader the University of Montreal with its many libraries is right around the corner less than  minutes walking and two major Francophone bookstores are right outside the hotel including the largest Francophone bookstore in Montreal For the busy person who wants to see as much of Montreal as possible and needs to move around fast and at a low cost the subway station is on the same street as the hotel only one block awayThe hotel staff is discreet and yet attentive to the needs of customers  Everyone I interacted with from the front desk personnel to the cleaning lady was very courteous and friendly every single time  This confirmed my initial impression when I called two different times the hotel for information prior to booking a room and also when I got a prompt response after communicating by e mail  The hotel is very safe and there is always someone at the front desk paying attention  As a woman traveling by myself I felt safe and protected The hotel room is really more like a small appartment with a erate living room with a sofa an armchair and a T V  a desk a kitchen table several chairs a full size stove and refrigerator plenty of pots and pans and dishes a coffee maker a toaster and a large sink  The bedroom part is private with a door which arates it from the living roomkitchen area  My room had two big beds a chest drawer and a big walk in closet  The bathroom was small in comparaison but it was fine  Overall the appartment was very pleasant  Also I was able to control my own unit for the air conditionner  Finally I never heard noises next door such as a phone ringing in a nearby room or people talking etc I would go back and stay in this hotel any time and I recommend it most highlyA very happy customer who hopes to return SorayaAtlanta Georgia 
P => An Undiscovered Gem My wife and I stayed at this hotel for  weeks when I was having surgery at the Jewish General hospital and during my post op recovery It was located within a few blocks of the hospital which made it easy for my wife to walk to visit me several times a day  We found the accomodations very clean and comfortable and the staff extremely friendly and cooperative willingly making a number of accomodations to address our personal situation  It is located in a cosmopolitain area with many interesting little restaurants and shops reflecting the multicultural mileau of the locale  It is also right on the bus and subway line making it quick and easy to get to downtown Montreal  Great value for your money  We will definitely return soon  
P => Location This hotel is situated in a gem of a location close to universite de Montreal the Jewish general and St ys Hospitals  
P => what a terrific surprise   I recently had a terrific stay at this hotel    I found the area its located to be perfect and the staff to be very friendly and accomodating    The room was perfect as ordered and it all made for a very pleasant stay    I will definately stay here again and soon  
P =>  pouvantable  
P => 
P => Great value  I stayed here while attending an academic conference  I paid less than  of the price of the conference hotels and got a single room plus continental breakfast not included at the other hotels  Breakfast is a big muffin coffee and juice  This is not the place to choose if you want new fashionable luxurious accommodations but I found the room clean and it had everything I needed  The hotel is a short walk from a metro stop and about a  minute walk from the Palais des Congres  It is a   minute walk to the Old City and to other parts of downtown  The manager was friendly and very helpful  I was very happy with my stay 
P => Hotel manager himself doesnt think this is a hotel  Best advice stay away My experience was quite bad  First of all the window in my room leaked a lot  I turned the heater on high and the room temperature wouldnt still rise above F  Also since the window was so thin and a part of it was replaced by wood you could also hear the noise from the street very loudly The lock in the door was also ridiculous   the safety lock had been ripped away and the lock itself wouldnt lock  I noticed it when I tried to access my room and I didnt even need a key   the door wasnt locked and I wasnt able to lock it from the outside no matter how much I tried   As far as I understand the hotel is run by an Indian person  He tries really hard to be friendly and all but doesnt really have money to run the place  Also sometimes the customer service fails    e g  when I asked him if there is an elevator in the hotel he replied in a loud voice quotNo we dont this is not a hotelquotI couldnt agree more  
P => Keep on going        right no by Dumpy  Watch their recession fight web ad   rooms starting at  hah  Began with a very argumentative desk person  Basement room tiny and better could be found near by  IN short its bad 
P => you get what you pay   not much its located about  minutes walk from the metro station where the airport bus stops the room was the smallest one Ive ever been too it was only every second time possible to flush the loo the breakfast is a cup of juice a cup of coffeemilktea and a chocolate or blueberry muffin or a plain croissant it wasnt possible to open the window and it was still very loud    
P => Have been staying there for  years Ive been to the Hotel Viger about  times in the last  years  It is a good budget option  The staff have always been friendly  Its located in a great location near a fun part of St  Catherine street and walking distance to pretty much anywhere  The rooms vary some are quite small but the doubles are roomy  Its a no frills place to stay for a short time and Ive never been disappointed  
P => Nice hotel   very helpful and friendly staff My boyfriend and I stayed in Montreal for  days and we found the hotel to be perfect at least for us  Of course if u r expecting  stars u wont get it  Our expectations aresafety e g  theft goodperfect location friendlyhelpful staff affordable clean amp not noisy room  This hotel gets an a from us for all of the above  
P => Great location and fantastic beds For over  years weve stayed at this charming century old inn  Clean comfortable fantastic beds most comfortable of any place weve ever stayed  The location is very handy between  Metro stops and a  minute walk to the Old Port or to St  Catherine St  very reasonable seasonal rates including breakfast croissants or muffin coffee tea or chocolate and OJ  Free internet access in the lounge and parking is available for a fee  Wonderful personal service  
P => Good inexpensive choice We truly enjoyed staying at the Viger Hotel  Its in a very central location ca  Min to the Basilica and the Old Montreal Downtown and has very polite and good English speaking service  The outside looks of the hotel and the rooms themselves are not ultra luxurious so if you look for luxury you  need to go somewhere else and pay considerably more  For us however it was the perfect choice and the quotpetite dejeunerquot continental breakfast sufficient for a good start in the morning  Parking was also easily found around the hotel we parked on a Friday evening and there is free parking then available all around the hotel till Monday morning  If you really dont know where to park which would be surprising to me then the hotel can still offer you a day pass at a nearby parking lot for Can    The Wifi internet was fast and reliable  
P => A Customer service After searching through many websites dealing with various accomidations and price ranges I found this hotel and price range to be the most easy to deal with The price was fantastic Check in was a breeze Parking was at the front doorThey give great old fashion service No frills or bologna Clean quiet accomidations  The shower in room   lets just say OMG I almost forgot to add soap to the equation best shower I have ever felt Staff was helpfull and very nice and willing to help with getting around the city with EXACT directions  I couldnt thank them enough They truly understand what customer service is all about 
P => Best X   Best Price Best Attention Best Location The Hotel Viger is a uncommon case of a hotel reduced price   Attention monitor on a daily by its owner clean FULL equipment air conditioning  heating hot water cable refrigerator WI FI Internet room microwave coffee  tea making facilities  Unlimited local calls and breakfast at no additional cost  Strategic location  blocks from a subway station and bus stops front to HOTEL THE BEST PRICE VALUE CARE  
P => well good value but i dont wanna go there again  p this hotel might be the very first hotel that i wont go back again but still its worth it when i consider the room rate the room was so small  bath also like one of the dorms what i just liked at this hotel was i could control the temperature of my room  well i was thankful to see the cables with that cheap rate but there was no remote control so i had to change the chanel hardly by myself and the locations is not that bad  its just  minutes walk to the bus terminal and subway station Chateau Lamzay and to the Beaux Montreal area  for the small budget travelers this hotel is not that bad  also they give either one of a small croisant or a muffin for the quotpetit dejourner  
P => Value for money We had three nights here and is was with some trepidation that we entered the hotel following some of the negative feedback we had seen on the web  First impression   tatty but this place grows on you  The room was small double had a great shower and a clean and comfy bed  If you are looking for a cheap option in a good location this  be it  The Ritz it aint but you should get a ent nights sleep at a very reasonable price  
P => you pay for what you get Well my boyfriend and I stayed this past long weekend at Hotel Viger even after reading the negative reviews which made us nervous about staying there we already reserved a room online by the time we found the reviews and are not the type of people to complain about the cancellation policy that we recieved in our email  Anyways we were quite nervous but ended up really enjoying our stay  With the amount of money we saved we were able to do some more shopping  The negative aspects were that the walls were pretty thin you can hear everyone opening and closing the door there is no alarm clock and the first morning we missed the breakfast and the shower is horribly small and does not remain at a constant temperature The good side was the bed was clean the tv works the location is great we walked everywhere the whole weekend and the guy at the front desk was really friendly towards us All in all you get what you pay for for  each per night around  in total it was good we were only at the hotel to sleep but if your more pickier then go with a larger chain hotel btw there is a great cafe north of Viger on St  Catherines if you end up missing the breakfast like we did  
P => Best Place to Stay I think that this is the best place to stay in Montreal  The first time my husband and I went before we were ried we stayed there  It was a great experince  I would do it again in a heart beat  
P => Friendly service and great location  Nothing fancy but room I stayed in was acommodating and clean  The service is friendly and the stay is very inexpensive would recommend to a couple if looking for something inexpensive  Very short walk to Old Montreal five minutes from the Cathedral  
P => It was alright   good for the price we paid This place is worth the money paid Had Air Conditioning bathroom and enough pillows and comforters For a group of  the washrooom was small   but when paying less then  per person for  nights   its worth itThe breakfest is way too early   but the good thing is that a McDs is close by and most things are within walking distance    so no fretting over a Jumbo muffin and a glass of OJ recommend going to a Timmys or a Convienence storeYour within the Old Port area and Metro is accessible  Your close to St  Denis and UQAM as well as to the clubs on St  Laurent I would come to this place again for the price i paid Cheers  
P => o k  but bring own cleaning products when i phoned and made reservations i specificly asked for a room with air conditioning when i arrived i got aroom with a fan   After asking to be switched to an air conditioned room they did give me another room however when i arrived at the new room it obviously had not been cleaned there was hair in the bathtub and dirt and crumbs all over the floor  i am not that picky and was not expecting a lot for the price of the room but i would like to walk around without other peoples dirt and mess sticking to my feet   I found a cleaner in the hall and asked if my room had been cleaned she said it had so i asked if she could vaccum because of mess on floor and that there was hair in the tub she was a little upset at my request and asked to be shown where there was hair in the tub she didnt however ask about the mess on the floor as that was obviuos  while getting our luggage she did vaccum the room and rinse the tub out but i cleaned the whole bathroom myself after bacause it still wasnt very clean  Overall it wasnt to bad other than the cleanliness and the price was good i paid   a night    a day for parking for a  bed room which is pretty good for that area  Its also only about a   min  walk to old montreal   The park across the street did seem to have a lot of homeless people but they didnt seem to bother anyone and the parking is  block away but you can see it from the front of the motel  I would probably stay again but this time i would take my own cleaning products  
P => Good enough for the price Weve stayed there on ust    Generally speaking this small hotel is worth its price  The rooms are small but clean and cozy  Staff is friendly breakfast included juice coffee muffin or croissant jam and butter  Parking is available nearby for  extra  Air conditioning was working well  In the summer time its very needed since rooms are small and windows wont open Overall I liked the place and would stay there again  
P => beware of the look and price We stayed at the Hotel Viger the night of ember    I had picked a brochure and it said  person a night   wow we tht not bad when i called to make reservations the man said oh because its the week its   more i tht alright still cheap  So we get there wow Victorian style yeah right When filling out papers the lady said oh it will be   more dollars because of Queen size bed  Bad Advertisement OK its still cheap but come When we got to the room oh my The bed takes up the whole room no closet the tv is up high on a shelve with brakets their is  tiny used towels very small  So if you want to spend a nice evening with your other half think again If you want to get there at  spend the night and get out the next morning not too bad  
P => small nice hotel Nice small Hotel close to the Metro and the Bus Station  We stay there every year  
P => A real charmer I recently stayed at the hotel viger  This hotel is definitely not for fat people  The showers are approximately  feet by  feet  A larger person could easily become wedged in place and a tragedy could result  Also the air conditioning in my room was non existent  There was a small vent along the floor but to the best of my knowledge cold air did not flow from it  There was very poor ventilation in general  My roomates had some gas issues and some added ventilation would have gone a long way  Personally I suggest that visitors stay at the iott or the Sheraton in downtown Montreal  The Best Western on Drummond also is a nice place to stay  I will say though that the paper quotpersonal bath matquot definitely added a touch of class to the establishment  
P => Beware   False advertising and rotten inside BEWARE This hotel does not have a quotwell preserved Antique Victorian exteriorquot nor is it quotmodernquot or quotclean and comfortablequot From the moment we walked into the crumbling hotel it reeked of cat urine and had buckets placed in the hallways to catch the water that was dripping out of the ceiling  The carpeting in our room was WET and MOLDY and we wore socks the entire time  The bathroom was so small that we had to sit sideways on the toilet and there was a HOLE in THE FLOOR Yes there was an AC unit in the window but it wasnt even sealed and you could SEE the street outside My husband called the   number to talk to me briefly and when he asked for my room   it was transferred and the person on duty listened in and very rudely SHOUTED quotGET OFF NOWquot then he hung up and came back on  seconds later and shouted at us quotHANG UP NOW GET OFFquot  Unbelieveable The quotcontinental breakfastquot is a tray of food that I wouldnt feed my dog  All we wanted was a quotclean and comfortablequot room   didnt think we were asking for much  We are used to staying in Motel  or Super  and I am not used to luxury at all but this place was a DIVE and the fact that they false advertise and that the website picture does not even resemble the REAL facade NEVER AGAIN We tried to leave  days early and go elsewhere but they CHARGED US UP FRONT AND REFUSED TO CREDIT MY ACCOUNT  No normal business could ever function like this   it was a total scam When I asked for a receipt upon check out I had to ARGUE with the worker on duty  The quotconvenientquot parking quotacross the streetquot is actually  blocks away behind a huge building and unlit  BEWARE The only good thing about this hotel is that it is located on the edge of Old Montreal  
P => Its definately a great stay year over Hotel viger is fantastically located within the Old Port Area of Montreal close enough to all the tourist action but not right in the middle so that it is quiet at night  Ive been going to the hotel for years and have always gotten a great view of the city  Their rooms are all different sizes but all have private washrooms  The staff I find is exceptional at prviding assistance and information  The best thing that I find is that the hotel is always filled with people during the summer months I go in y and you get to meet people form all over the Europe  The Old Port is absolutely the best during this time of year  There are thousands of tourists and tons of shows and events going on within a short walk of the hotel  They dont kid around when they tell you to book ahead  Its not the Crown Plaza but it its clean and quiet and safe and close to all the events  Cathy 
P => Bait and Switch Advertising for Rates Hotel Viger posts one rate then charges another for the same room when you make a reservation  Heres the text of what they sent me when they confirmed that my reservation cost per night was   higher than what theyd advertised   oh and by the way theyd already charged my credit card and dont permit cancellationsquotThe ad in the Tourist Guides Maps and Web site for quotGUARANTEED PRICESquot are for   of the total rooms we have and so are only for quotLIMITED ROOMSquot  The room you are asking for with publicity prices is already reserved for the same period a long time ago  quotSo   buyer beware make sure you get the rate in writing before you make your reservation

P => Hotel Villa   experience downtown Montreal While staying here for the Montreal Jazz festival I found this hotel which is quite in the middle of the festival to be very clean and our room was quiet despite many music events happening outside in the streets and being located next door to a popular event venue The Metropolis  It was literally steps to the festival and the concert next door that I was there to attend  Winnie the new amp current owner pays attention to the needs and requests of the guests and all staff keep a keen eye out for the safety and comfort those staying in the hotel  The hotel has a security entrance which only allows for guests to be allowed entry to the hotel and there are cameras on each floor to further monitor the safety of the patrons  Our room recently remodelled had  double beds mini fridge tv ac and a bathroom you could put a queen size bed in Very good for a couple of girls There are options to get rooms which share a common bathroom and having viewed the common bathroom would see this as a great option of lowering the cost of your stay  The housekeeping staff provide excellent care to the rooms and are very friendly  This is a perfect affordable hotel to stay in if you wish to be in the heart of Montreal and close to a wide variety of entertaining and cultural things to do  Winnies welcome of us each time returning to the hotel after wandering about the streets made it feel like we had come home  Thanks 
P => Perfect spot to visit the city Hotel Villa is a perfect place for visiting the city  It is very convenient to get to the old Montreal Chinatown and shopping malls  The rooms are very cheap and comfortable  Staffs are very nice and helpful  They helped me plan my visit in Montreal  I dont think I would have time and opportunity to visit so many places in so short time if they did not suggested me which places to visit most importantly  Great place to stay  
P => Best for the Price I stayed for couple of days in the weeked with my family  The new administration is fantastic  Very friendly and very good service  And panaromic view of downtown of Montreal  Easy to access for all services including Metro Bus and restaurants  Very important thing is near to the old port  Walking distance  Multicultural environment and planty of festivals  Room rates are very good compare to other hotels  Family packages are fantastic  
P => Dont expect a lot Overall this hotel is okay at best  There are only two positives very clean and new bathrooms and a ent location to crash at night  However the asthetic appearance and quality is the worst Ive experienced  The interior hallways are from an old abandoned building some rooms are rented out on a fulltime basis to bums and the hotel is frequently used by prostitutes in the area  Also there is no ac or tv  Bathrooms are an option in the room I strongly suggest you get the room with one as you do not want to be sharing a hallway bathroom with the people of this area  This hotel is good for younger people who dont care as much about the looks but be advised that management is very tight about the no visitors policy they guard the door   We got into an argument with them because we couldnt bring back friends for the afternoon  
P => Price location staff  great    Building  rooms hallways  need work I stayed with a friend at this Hotel for New Years Eve Weekend  Upon arriving I was shocked to see that the pictures online depicted something very different in my mind  When we were brought to our room we were a little dissappointed with the appearance  The walls are very plain and the tv doesnt come in very well  Also the hallways and stairways had about  different types of carpet    it was as if they ran out of the kind they were using half way up the stairs  a new color for every floor  It looked somewhat quotghettoquot  Although the room wasnt what I had in mind it was ALWAYS spotless and immaculate  the bathroom especially which is ofcourse a GOOD thing  Never the less my friend and I  being college aged young women were not there to enjoy the room and the tv  All we needed was a place to crash after hitting the clubs and drinking all night  The location was absolutely SUPERB It was right in the middle of all the hottest clubs bars and so on  so it was extremely difficult to get lost even if intoxicated lol Also the staff  the owner and his wife I believe were extremely pleasant and helpful The hotel was cheap  considering the nights I stayed one of the most busy weekends   a night  I got what I payed for as far as the room goes    but as far as location and staff I got far and beyond more then what I payed for  A great first timer in Montreal experience Me and my friend will be returing to Montreal this New Year coming up  and will probably give good thought on returning to this establishment  
P => its a great inexpensive hotel  It was my first visit to Montreal when I stayed at the Hotel Villa de France  It was inexpensive and such a pleasant surprise  The hotel is right in the middle of everything    on rue St Catherine close to vieux Montreal and the Contemporary Arts Musee  I was also able to get cheap transportation to and from the airport and hotel  The best part of my experience staying at the Hotel Villa de France was that the hotel owner was very sweet and the place was extremely clean I had an en suite bathroom  No phone tv or alarm clock    but who needs that when everything is great

P => Small Gem in a Big City This was our second visit to the Hotel XIXe Si cle  It is located in Montreals old town just a few blocks up from the port and a block or so away from the tourist shops that abound in that area  There is free on street overnight parking on the weekends meters during the day valet parking is also available  The lobby of the hotel has held different interesting art exhibits both times we have been there  The staff was accommodating quick to help with restaurant suggestions or directions  We have had some lovely meals at restaurants that they recommended  The rooms are spacious and appear even larger because of the  ceilings  The furniture is very european and well kept up  Nice art on the walls  Our bathroom provided everything we needed including a nice shower and good lighting  The lighting in the room was also good  Our package included breakfast   the dining room was nice and bright the food was a typical hotel breakfast buffet   cereal toast bagels fruit yogurt and coffee The location of the hotel is great close to the sights in the old town and not a bad walk to downtown Montreal shopping  There are also buses that run close by  We would highly recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend getaway or an extended stay  
P => Youll love this place My wife and I recently stayed here for three nights  I loved it here  It s very close to Notre Dame and Old Montreal  The metro is close  The rooms were very clean  The staff was always ready with suggestions and really seemed to love their beautiful city  Pick this one 
P => Charming Hotel beautiful rooms This is a late report   we stayed here in il  We found this hotel to be very charming  From the outside the hotel is so beautiful  The rooms are well appointed with nice linens and the bathroom is very clean  We found the rooms to be very comfortable and spacious  The lobby does not give justice to the rooms  The staff in the hotel was always gracious and cheerful  I found their service to be top notch  Ask for water bottles if you need any  The breakfast buffet held downstairs has a ent spread  Since it is in the banking district there are several restaraunts close by including a Coffee shop across the street  Make sure to dine at quotEggspectationsquot which is right out of the hotel  Their crepes and meals are wonderfulYou are just seconds away from the Basilique Notre Dame and near the underground entrance as well Keep in mind that there is a charge for parking  They will valet your car for you  I dont recall how much it was possibly  CADday  Im not certain if there are other private parking garages nearby All in all we enjoyed staying at this hotel  We would consider staying here again when we return to Montreal some day 
P => Excellent place to stay This hotel is well located in the banking district and on the edge of the old city  The building is very attractive and the interior well orated  There is no pool or exercise facility but the staff is wonderful  My wife had numerous questions and the desk staff always provided accurate and helpful answers in very good English  Suggested restaurants always had good food and reasonable prices  The valet parked our car one block away so we could easily access it  Compared to the fancier hotels in the neighborhood the price was great  I rated the room very good because there were a few threads loose and some painting errors which someone less fussy might miss  
P => Fabulous choice We had  rooms booked at the hotel for an event  One ior suite  single rooms  smaller doubles  double rooms with one queen bed and  double with two queen beds  First of all the service was fabulous  Second ALL of the rooms were great  Of particular note was room  double with two beds that seemed larger  We were initially given ior suite  which was nice but had  windows pointing directly at the building next door so had very little light  We changed to  and it was FABULOUS   we think its the one featured on their website  Its in the back of the hotel and generally all the rooms in the bad X   X have a nicer view we think  Note   the suite did have a jacuzzi even thought they told us it doesnt   we did not complain Overall the stay was fantastic everyone LOVED the rooms and since we booked on other peoples behalf and we chose the hotel there was cause for concern     The lobby is very spacious and comfortable the little library is very cute and breakfast was nice  The elevator is a bit slow but not a big deal   the stairs worked just fine if you dont mind stairs  We HIGHLY recommend this place 
P => Great Hotel in perfect location We loved this hotel  Great stay and the staff was very helpful  We had done some research and found that the staff recommended all the same sites and restaurants  We were so close to everything in the Old City and very easy to get around  We used the Metro stop just a block away to get to The Village and to the Olympic Park  We took a walking tour in the Old City and also saw amazing light show at Notre Dame  The river tour was great too  But our favorite hidden gem was the house museum called Ch teau Dufresne Museum near the Olympic Park  Also check out the underground city in the old Port area at Centre dhistoire de Montr al  This museum also had a cool light and video show that explained the history of Montreal  Then you walk under the building and see the actual ruins of the first buildings  Great food at Bonaparte Boris Bistro and Jardin Nelson  
P => Perfectly wonderful A delightful place to stay My husband and I loved this hotel   the high ceilings chandeliers and or  It was very clean and the staff were warm and inviting  Anything we asked for i e  towels ice was delivered within minutes to our door and they were so helpful with ideas for restaurants walking tours etc  It is well situated on the edge of Old Montreal but still within a  minute walk of the Palais de Congres where our conference took place and a  minute walk of downtown shopping  Perfect 
P => Clean wonderful service great location We stayed at the Hotel Xixe for our first anniversary  On arrival our car was parked and returned when we needed it for the same price it would have cost to park over night anywhere in the city but be forewarned that parking is not included it is extra and we were given a city map and recommendations on walking routes restaurants and places of interest  The service was friendly and helpful  The room was clean and comfortable  We had a great night sleep on the bed and the ceilings were high and gave the whole place a grand feel  On Montreal athon day and we were given a map of the course so we could watch but it included road closures and information for when we were headed out of town  We really lucked out finding this place  
P => Great boutique hotel offering wonderful service in a good location  We really enjoyed our stay at Xixe Siecle hotel  The service was outstanding and our room was small but very nice  This is an old bank that has been transformed into a hotel  Overall it was a great place to stay and we were able to walk all around Old Montreal from the hotel  It s very close to the Basilica and the front desk staff will provide you with a map and information about places in the area  One thing that I should point out is that the first taxi driver didn t know what I was talking about when I said Xixe Siecle  It s french for th century which he figured out and took us right there  I would definitely stay here again  The continental breakfast was  if I remember correctly but some websites include breakfast when booking   we really enjoyed the croissants  
P => Lovely hotel wonderful staff I stayed at Hotel XIXe Siecle in Montreal for two nights  My stay was very nice and I would definitely stay here again  My room was large with very high ceilings comfortable bed free internet bright lighting and cuddly terry robe in the bathroom there was also a telephone in the bathroom Im not exactly sure why but this detail somehow speaks to thoroughness  The staff are exceptional    cheerful helpful full of smiles I really enjoyed my interactions with them  The continental breakfast is served in a very pleasant European style breakfast room  The hotel is located within walking distance of a taxi stand subway many restaurants the touristy part of Old Montreal Vieux Montr al and water front the Basilique Notre Dame City Hall etc  yet is on a street that is very quiet at night so well located for a good nights sleep  I highly recommend this hotel especially if you want to treat yourself as the price per night is slightly on the expensive side  
P => Charming through and through This hotel is in a great location for exploring Old Montreal  It is a beautiful hotel in and outside surrounded by great architecture and ambience  Close to the subway routes too  
P => Great Hotel in a Great Location We stayed at XIX for three nights prior to taking a cruise  Our room was ready ahead of time  We loved the location  only a few short blocks from Notre Dame and all the shops and restaurants on Rue St  Paul  The towels and comp robes were beyond soft  The staff was helpful for restaurants and directions  The building maintained an old charm while its or is up to date  
P => A Gem Our family spent two nights at Hotel XIXe Siecle and we were very pleased  We liked the location only a couple of blocks from the Basilica of Notre Dame  The staff were outstanding    friendly and helpful while maintaining a quiet air of professionalism  The building is French Second Empire and the rooms themselves are lovely with high ceilings and big windows  The rooms were quiet and restful and were furnished rather elegantly  The beds were quite comfortable and the baths were very nice  There was only one tiny tiny problem    the temperature of the water seemed to vary in the shower  The water was always sufficiently warm but it could become much warmer quite suddenly    and then just as suddenly drop back to its previous temperature  The breakfast was very good and the valet parking was handled very efficiently  We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it  
P => Great stay Great hotel excellent location in Vieux Montreal close to restaurants shops and old port  Staff was outstanding  The room was comfortable private and clean with high ceilings  Valet parking was a must especially with construction narrow streets etc  We walked around and had a great dinner  If youre seeking to party all night this part of town is not the best  Its a business district so shops close early in the evening  We were very satisfied with our choice and would recommend this hotel for a nice relaxing get away  
P => This is what service is ALL about   For definitive hotel service stay at this hotel  After a rather disappointing night in Quebec City our arrival here was nothing short of bliss  Valet parking someone unloaded the bags from the car everyone has a smile from ear to ear and means it and the place is lovely  Quiet relaxing surroundings in which to revive yourself after sightseeing etc  Knowledgable staff pointed us at fireworks display late evening and provided an etxtensive list of recommendations for dinner  Room was spacious well appointed with free wireless internet  Perhaps I am wesring rosy glasses after a dreadful night in teh previous hotel but I feel as though the folks that operate this hotel love what they do and it shows    as iot should  
P => What a great stay I came to this hotel in the off season of Montreal tourism  Here are some pros and cons Pros Very quiet No noise from the street with the exception of roadwork that started up before I left or hotel clientele   I ordered room service twice and found the food to be OK  But I still advise finding a restaurant  Room service should be a LAST resort  Friendly and courteous staff who speak perfect English    Conveniently located about  blocks from the Square Victoria metro station and a  minute walk to the nearest VIA Rail Canada station  Because youre on the border between downtown and Old Montreal a lot of tourist sites are close by  Free Wi Fi Pretty clean rooms I got bed service even when I didnt request it  Cons Contrary to what the hotels website says it is NOT in the HEART of Old Montreal  Its actually on the far NW corner right on the border with downtown Montreal proper   Because the hotel is downtown the streets are DEAD after work hours and on the weekends  So no places to shop or eat out during those times   The free Wi fi network is UNSECURE  So user beware  It also cut on and off on me a few times  But that might have been my own Wi fi catcher acting up  I cant imagine there being any great views in this hotel unless you have a suite  I could see a little bit of the Basilique Notre Dame de Montreal from my bedroom window though   Only one VERY slow elevator  Take the stairs down  With the cons being of little significance to me anyway I would highly recommend this hotel  I also suggest going to Montreal in late ilearly   Not a lot of folks around and the weather was amazing  
P => Classy and comfortable My eldest dhter and I travelled to Montreal to bring back my younger dhter after her first year at McGill University  After one night squashed into her residence room trying to rough it and economize I logged into her computer and searched Montreal hotels I phoned Hotel XIX Siecle and got a last minute rate for two nights and we were able to check in at noon that same day  We had a large room at the front of the hotel fourth floor with two queen beds  It was heavenly  So much space for the three of us and our luggage The beds were comfortable and the linens warm and cosy  We like it cool at night so we were able to turn down the temperature overnight with in room controls  I liked the bathroom very much  The lighting was nice and sparkly and the tub nice and deep  Another comment I read on TripAdvisor said the water wasnt hot enough  I wonder if they realized you can adjust the temperature  The handle turns onoff but theres another slider bar for the temperature  We found the location to be perfect  Valet parking was much appreciated  Its a day charge with unlimited ins and outs  I had parked overnight at the university the night before and was charged  for  hours of street parking on campus so this was much superior  We enjoyed walking around Old Montreal and ate at several great unique restaurants  We had breakfast in the breakfast room on the second morning  It was so good that we were wishing we had gone there the previous morning as well  The price of  per person was extremely reasonable for the beautiful selection  The breakfast room is beautiful and the server was attentive and pleasant  Staying at this hotel saved our three day Montreal visit from being a disaster and turned it into a very enjoyable experience  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Excellent quality and value in a prime location   a real gem  The hotel was a complete delight with friendly helpful staff an excellent location only five minutes walk from the metro and underground city and about ten minutes walk to Vieux Montreal  My room  booked as an economy package had an extremely comfortable bed with high quality bedding good lighting and furnishings and a very clean and commodious bathroom with lovely toiletries in generous sizes  and replaced daily  I had breakfast on one day but the dining room was almost empty although the breakfast was fine  There are lots of places in the immediate vicinity where you can get continental or cooked breakfast for the same sort of price  CD  As a middle aged woman travelling alone I felt safe and comfortable  There is an elegant bar area adjacent to the lobby with sofas and magazines as well as free internet access and a printer   useful if you want to check in online for your flight home  Drinks were reasonably priced  no more expensive than outside the hotel and with the bonus of a happy hour from  pm  Other guests at the hotel were mostly middle aged couples or singles with a few business people  Although the hotel doesnt have a designated luggage room they looked after my two huge suitcases in their basement all day on my day of departure and made no charge for this  Staff at the hotel organised my taxi to the airport  flat rate of CD took all my luggage out to the taxi for me  They could not have been kinder or more helpful all spoke good English and made me feel very welcome  I would certainly stay there again and recommend the hotel highly  
P => Good simple boutique hotel Id always wanted to stay in the old town in Montreal and I finally made it  This hotel is in a pretty old quothotel de villequot style house with the lobby up a short staircase from the street  The check in was efficient and friendly  The room was large and very comfortable with a good bathroom and very comfortable bedding  The or was very tasteful   in keeping with the period of the building without being pastiche or fussy  The internet worked well  All that was missing was a kettle in the room  Breakfast in the morning was in a restaurant style room and was a good continental spread with enough choice The location is ideal for exploring the old town and close enough to the business district I recommend this as a very good quality tourist hotel or a mid range business hotel for road warriors tired of big box hotels  
P => Great Stay Great Staff they are very friendly and knowledgeable about the city  They are ready to help you whenever you need help  If you only speak English dont feel intimidated to speak to them in English  They are very good at speaking both French and English  The hotel rooms are big  Beds are comfy  The pillows are either to soft or two hard  The square one with the hotels name on it was a good medium  Bathrooms are clean The hotel is located just a couple of blocks from the metro the Science Museum Rue St  Laurent Rue Peel Rue  Street and a couple of other popular streets  About mile or two away you can get to Rue Cresent which has a few bars night clubs and a Hard Rock Cafe  Lobby is a really nice area to sit and enjoy a drink work on the computer free wifi and just shoot the breeze with people  Pizza was great 
P => Nice hotel with few minor issues The staff at this hotel was great spoke good english and was friendly for the whole stay  Room was very nice size for the price of around   per night  Location is ok I was in middle of cold winter so used taxi to get around but based on little walking I got the imperssion that this is really good location during summer when you dont freeze to death by just walking meters  Couple little complaints my room wasnt exactly quiet I think the biggest issue was the door wasnt really sound proof and then the pipes made little noise  However the noise wasnt so bad that it would have gotten annoying and id have to go complain  nd issue is that it was impossible to seet he television from the bed so if you are like me who needs little TV to fall asleep this might be a small issue Overall I think staying at this hotel during your montreal visit is a ent idea  
P => Fabulous hotel in the heart of old montreal Using the guidance of Tripadvisor we booked this hotel and got a great rate on a suite with parking and breakfast included  The hotel is in a great location steps from the famous Notre Dame Cathedral in old Montreal  The hotel itself is beautiful with old world charm   room was huge with great amenities  Service was good with valet parking bellboy free newspaper and coffee downstairs in the jmorning FREE wifi internet  You cannot go wrong with this hotel  
P => Great boutique hotel hope new owners keep it up Love to stay here when I can great value right on the doorstep of Old Montreal  Have stayed for business and pleasure iun the past   Staff helpful and friendly rooms with vaulting cielings and French provincial furniture for that Parisian feeling dont like the barrestaurant but there are many to choose from in the neighborhood even for breakfast  New owners propose to change the name and do a reno but heres hoping it remains an affordable place to stop in a really special piece of North America  
P => Very good hotel in a good location We really enjoyed staying at this hotel  The building is beautiful and interesting  Our standard room was quite large and the tall ceilings were quite impressive  They made the room feel open romantic and comfortable  We were very close to the Nortre Dam Old Montreal and Chinatown  It is very easy to walk or hop on the metro  There is no restuarant onsite but they do have a nice bar for drinks and lounging and a place to offer breakfast  The service was good  We did hear they were going to do some minor reations switching the check in desk with the bar area  That should work out very well  
P => Perfect Location   Great Stay My wife and I have been to Montreal twice once staying on the corner of Ste Catherine Ouest close to the bar scene and this time at the Hotel Xixe Siecle  We LOVED it The location is perfect as we could walk to Notre Dame all of Old Montreal and only a few blocks away is the metro stop to take you anywhere  The lobby is great with a small bar and sitting area with floor to ceiling books  The staff was incredibly helpful valet parking was quick and attentive The rooms were gorgeous  We stayed in a small suite with a arate sitting area  High ceilings french doors everything perfect I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Lovely comfortable boutique hotel  great location This is a very comfortable boutique hotel located on a very pretty street  You are located in walking distance of beautiful old Montreal and a short cab ride to the great shopping on rue St  Catherine  We found the room extremely spacious and comfortable  The bed was fantastic and the bathroom was clean and well supplied  The World Cup was on while we were visiting and my husband was able to enjoy a lot of it because the TV in the room was big with great reception sometimes hotel TVs can be small and sketchy We found that the room was particularly quiet which we appreciated  you really couldnt hear any noise outside  The breakfast included was standard the breakfast area was in a windowless room that could have been improved upon  But no complaints with the quality of the breakfast  The service was excellent and we were very happy with our stay  We would likely return as the value we received was very good  
P => Great Location This charming hotel is well located near the Place dArms on a quiet side street  You get the benefit of being near most everything in Veiux Montreal without the noise  The clean rooms are very large with comfortable beds and tall ceilings  The staff is friendly but a little overworked  One evening the bartenderbell hopvalet had been away from the bar for quite some time while some thirsty patrons were waiting at the small bar  Finally another staffer came to pour drinks but assured us that his bartending skills did not go beyond beer and wine  We were happy to oblige but it would be nice to have more consistent service at happy hour  This small issue is the only problem we had during our stay  
P => Beautiful bouquet hotel EXCELLANT LOCATION My son and I stayed at Hotel Xixe Siecle y    st   It was our first visit to Montreal we were not disappointed The hotel is beautiful we could not fault any thing about it  The Hotel being bouquet is much better than named international hotels the service is much more personel  If you dont speak french   dont worry the staff speak english I have enclosed photos of the hotel and bedroom and belive it or not the main toilets on the ground floor I had to take photos of the wallpeper really quirky  The hotel is orated in french design very comfortable  Our bedroom Classical was orated in gold and cream  we had a tv pleanty of storage but no facilities to make tea or coffee  the bathroom was adequate shower over the bath plenty of good quality linen the free products of shampoo etc were of a high quality The staff are wonderful and are more than willing to help you enjoy your stay  They provide directions order tickets for you advise on places to go  VERY helpful  The lobby has a very good stock of Montreal information brochures  The Bar Breakfast roomand Library are also on the ground floor here there is free internet   Breakfast  conti excellant fab choices Bottle of water   you are not charged this was one of there thoughtful touches  The couches and chairs at reception clean and very comfy  The lastest magazines are always on hand   The location is excellant you are one street away from the Bas  of Notre Dame   DO NOT miss the light show   Fantastic  The old town is on your door stop the shopping of Catherine street   out of the hotel walk a few yards turn right travel up road and you are on Catherine Street  
P => Beautiful hotel excellent location We spent  nights at this hotel and we enjoyed our stay very much The lobby is very charming the location excellent right in Vieux Montreal one block from the Basilique the notre dame and the rooms spacious clean and beautifully orated  Free wireless internet access The staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants and attractions  There are several excellent dining choices nearby Bonaparte and Aix just a few blocks away We bought a package  nights including breakfast and parking and it was excellent value  
P => Great stay Excellent Hotel  Fantastic location near Old Town and Subway  We got a Jr Suite and were very happy with the staff rooms and breakfast supplied  
P => Super My young dhter and I stayed for a week in y  The hotel was in a perfect location to walk to the quotold townquot or up and over to St  Catherine St  for shopping  Easy access to metro and only a few blocks from the Central Train Station  I cannot rave enough about the friendly unassuming helpful staff   so professional Our room exceeded my expectations  We had a quotstandardquot room that was beautiful High ceilings very large amount of floor space nice furnishings lovely old windows and a huge bathroom with arate jacuzzi tub and shower We never ate at the hotel but did enjoy complimentary coffee and and an occasional apple from the bowl Montreal itself is a lovely city with friendly people and numerous activities to keep one entertained    
P => Real Old Town Charm and Character at XIXe Siecle My husband and I plus a group of friends stayed at XIXe Siecle the past weekend of y   If you want to experience the real charm of old town Montreal this is definitely the place to stay  The Hotel was everything we expected  The photos on their website mirror everything on offer The bathrooms were spotlessly clean and the room was large and comfortable  Our friends had one of the suites and the room was large with an adjacent sitting room The breakfast included in our price was fantastic  Hard boiled eggs cheeses thinly sliced ham cereals croissants    the list goes on    The dining room is quaint and relaxing  It made for a lovely start to the morning  We have stayed in other chain hotels in Montreal previously and they were ent but for the same price cannot compare to Hotel XIXe Siecle Staff were fantastic and very helpful The location is great a close enough walk to the Port and also to St Catherines Street for shopping  All in all a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Loved this boutique gem My husband and I just returned from this lovely gem of a boutique hotel located in Old Montreal  We loved the ambiance of our room and the hospitality of the staff  We stayed two nights and enjoyed every moment  Walking around Old Montreal felt very European  It was about a fifteen minute walk to downtown Montreal for great shopping  The complimentary breakfast was lovely  The staff were extremely polite and accomodating  We felt very well treated and thoroughly recommend this gem for anyone looking for a memorable stay  
P => Great Hotel My husband and i stayed a few nights at Hotel Xixe Siecle and were thrilled   the rooms were spacious and clean the staff friendly and attentive and the breakfast delicious We will stay there again on future Montreal trips 
P => A wonderful experience My wife and I just returned from a weekend at Hotel Xixe Siecle  I selected this hotel based almost entirely upon reviews at TripAdvisor and was very pleased  The room was quite large clean and extremely comfortable  The included breakfast had a lot to offer and favorable hours    The hotel offers valet parking but the desk clerk offered the option of parking on the street for free and gave me tips on where to find the coveted spots  This hotel is not overdone with pushy service and that is one of the things I found to be great  No one trying to wrestle my bags away from me  No one being paid to open the door just good friendly and courteous basic service  The lobby barlounge was very nice  Two for one drinks from    This was an excellent experience and I WILL go back  
P => A great place to stay in Old Montreal Hotel Xixe Siecle was an excellent stay  I am writing this review on the day of departure from my room which has to be one of the best rooms I have stayed in my many years of domestic and international travel  I drove up from Boston  hours for a weekend stay with my dhter   The hotel is situated in Old Montreal and minutes walk from the Montreal Metro  Therefore most of the city is accessible  However the calm of the area the closeness to the water and the mangificent buildings of old Montreal made this a very peaceful vacation  The hotel is Boutique so if you are more comfortable in the traditional riot type hotel you  not be as comfortable here  The style is European and I would recommend this for couples new and old  Restaurants in the area are good  Gibbys seems popular and a nice setting  I tried the new Sushi Rest called Tatami which is unusal in that the tables are actually fish tanks and the food is artfully done  We walked St Catherine street had ice creme nearby with the locals and really had a relaxed time  I am coming back and would try for this hotel again  Worth every star of its  star rating  
P => a Great Deal We got a great deal going directly to the hotel  nights almost half price third night free complimentary continental breakfast  We had a wonderful stay in the Hotel  The staff was friendly and very helpful  Our room was comfortable and spacious  The hotel is well located  The barlounge and the dining room were cheerful well staffed and the breakfast was very good  The staff helped us out with recommendations for places to eat and things to do  We would definitely try to book the Hotel Xixe Siecle the next time we visit Montreal  
P => This hotel is great in everyway Even though we live in Detroit we ided to book a winter getaway to Montreal and Quebec since the prices were so reasonable   we did a  day Montreal  day Quebec City and  day back to Montreal before our flight home  We spent  nights at Hotel Xixe Siecle and they were great We booked a great stay  night get  night free off their website only  CAD per night and received a room with the most amazing whirlpool tub ever  queen beds ceilings so high you could have fit another story in our room a grand sized room etc  The staff was also very helpful in giving directions recommendations for dining etc  Also even though my husband and I love to walk and did despite the cold and snow we were a  minute walk from the Metro Station which made everything conveniently located  Please note there is also a computer with free internet in the lobby and a cute quotLibraryquot themed bar in the lobby   the only detriment was the lack of exercise roomfacility but with such other great serviceslocationstaff I could live without this  It was a perfect stay in a great city 
P => Chic and affordable We booked our Queen bed room online at hotels com for night CDN We stayed for  nights during the week of Valentines  The room itself is well appointed with a Queen size bed desk TV and wardrobe for hanging clothing  Celings are very high at least  feet  Washroom is smaller but functional  The towels were very plush and luxurious This hotel as stated by other reviewers is a reated older building so there is definitely character in this building which is great since its located in Old Montreal Vicinity wise there is an Eggspectations across the street which opens at am and serves breakfastlunch  We had breakfast on our last morning in the hotel and werent very impressed  It was a very basic Continental breakfast that was per person For dinner there are a lot of restaurants within walking distance  We went to Bon A Part for dinner one night  It was very enjoyable although we were a bit under dressed and dressed more for the snow storm they had that day This hotel is very close to Central Station where we arrived by train  In addition we were able to walk from our hotel to Chinatown and Rue St  Catherines which is a main strip without difficulties No complaints and we would definitely stay here again Staff is very friendly and helpful 
P => Great Stay in Old Montreal We stayed here for a weekend in uary  Everything about this hotel was great location rooms staff etc  The hotel itself is very pretty it was an old bank that was converted  The staff was world class couldnt have been more helpful or friendly  Notre Dame was literally a  minute walk down the road and St  Paul Rue the main drag in old montreal is right around the corner  The rooms were very nicely orated and had cathedral ceilings which made them seem huge  Considering all this I was shocked at how cheap the room was  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Old Montreal  
P => Great hotel We stayed at the XIXe Siecle for  nights and could not fault it    Im surprised it doesnt rate more highly on tripadvisor The hotel is in a great location in old montreal and is easy walking distance from downtown and the Place DArmes metro station  Our room was large with high ceilings very clean and comfortable  Breakfast was great   croissants cake and muffins bread fresh fruit salad juice cheese  Also the staff we met at breakfast and on the front desk were all very polite and helpful We stayed at the Sofitel on the last night of our holiday and we actually preferred the XIXe Siecle   We would definitely stay here again  
P => Fantastic Location and Deal We were searching for a place to stay having never been to Montreal before  After reading several reviews we opted for this hotel and contacted them directly for a booking  At this time they beat the expedia rate and offered us a   CAA discount  That took our room rate to night for Thurs   Sun The hotel is a converted bank and is located in central Old Montreal  There is a metro stop within a couple blocks which easily gets you some prime shopping and restaurant areas  The staff were very helpful recommending great restaurants and providing directions The rooms are not large but the very high ceilings make the rooms feel roomy  And the lobby bar has  for  drinks every evening We would stay here again  
P => Very Nice    unbelievable value I am a frequent business traveller and have stayed at many hotels in Montreal  This hotel is a tremendous value  Very European feel to match the location near the old city Room was large and clean but the furnishings did not seem to match the grandeur of the room high ceilings  Bathroom was adequate with very nice toileteriesService was excellent whenever requested  Bar is nice for a quick drink before going out for diner Valet parket is convenient and very cheap  Will definetly return 
P => Sincere pleasant and prompt service We stayed at this Hotel from       We had reserved probably the least expensive class of room which was very nice  The mattress was great  The towels were great   the softest Ive felt in a long time  Upon arrival the bellman immediatly helped us unload  including arranging for storage of our bikes and parking of our car  The staff and bellman provided us all of the immediate information we needed to get to Bank and maps for sightseeing and for bike riding restaurants and were generally just very nice to talk with  Large Continential breakfast was included and was very good in my opinion and wait staff were very accomodating and pleasant  I liked the hotel very much and would recommend it  
P => Wonderful Thoroughly enjoyed this hotel the location was perfect for all of the sights we planned on seeing  The metro was right down the street  Montreal is a very safe and warm city to visit  The staff at the hotel were very professional and friendly  They were so patient with all of us tourists asking a million questions  The rooms were very clean and maintained well  It was always quiet and we slept well  The breakfast buffet was good but could have used more variety especially after a couple of days stay  No vending machines so get any night munchies while you are out and about The drinks at happy hour were pretty expensive  I would definitely stay there again and enjoy the beautiful city of Montreal  
P => Good Friendly Small Hotel The XIX is a smaller hotel in the old part of Montreal an easy  mins walk to the St Lawrence river  We had made an online booking and were welcomed at reception by the friendly staff  The room was quite large and overlooked the rear of the hotel  Everything was clean and comfortable and the room service again was friendly and efficient A continental buffet breakfast was served in the groundfloor dining room and was reasonably comprehensive without too much choice There was a reasonably priced internet access in the lounge which was a little slow A good stay in a smaller friendly hotel  
P => Lovely hotel This is a good hotel in a beautiful building  The first thing to note is that there are quite a few stairs to get into the lobby but there are members of staff waiting to help when you arrive  The receptionist were all very helpful especially the lady who helped us book tickets to an exhibition using her personal email account The rooms are very nice clean and spacious  The breakfast is very good with lovely fresh breads fruit and cheeses  The hotel is well located between the old town and major shopping areas The only criticism I have is the laundry   they dry clean everything even if you only want it laundered and then charge you for it  I got cht out badly here and the management were not willing to make any reduction to the charges even though I had clearly written on the laundry sheet that I did not want dry cleaning as instructed to do by the reception staff  Montreal is generally overpriced compared to other cities in Canada and this experienced just added to our feeling of being ripped off once again Overall a good hotel in a nice location  
P => Fabulous hotel My wife and I just stayed at this hotel for our th Wedding Anniversary  The lobby was gorgeous the staff could not have been nicer the continental breakfast was great especially the croissants and the fresh fruit cup and the location was in the middle of everything in Old Montreal  The room and the bathroom are on the small side but the bed was extremely comfortable  There is so much to do in Montreal we were hardly in our room at all anyway  We would stay there again anytime  
P => Wonderful stay We just arrived home from Hotel XIX and have already ided that when we return to Montreal we will stay there again  The Hotel is perfectly located between Old Montreal and downtown and when the weather is nice you can walk everywhere  The staff was incredibly friendly helpful and were a pleasure to deal with  Happy hour is from   at their quiet bar and the quottwo for onequot drinks were unbeatable  Our superior room was very large nicely orated and was immaculate  We had the most amazing stay and are looking forward to our return  
P => Third time and Still Charming My spouse and I have stayed at Hotel Xixe Siecle three times in the past couple of years  Several things keep us coming back Proximity to Old Montreal  Its in the heart of Old Montreal and just a couple of blocks from the Quay  Prices are some of the lowest in Old Montreal  If you look around not only on their website youll find prices far below the stated average  We paid  during the latter part of  during the Cirque du Soleil run  Well kept rooms and friendly helpful staff  Arriving late in the afternoon the last time we stayed the Front Desk staff called several different restaurants to get us a reservation for that evening  If youve ever been to Old Montreal youll know that its sometimes impossible to get into some of the more popular places    but not for usBy the way be sure to take their valet parking   finding a parking spot in Old Montreal at ANY time is difficult 
P => Another Trip Advisor Winner Another excellent hotel stay thanks to the many TAers who reviews this hotel  thanks Got a great deal at the AARP travel web site  Huge room  Excellent air conditioning during a very hot week in Montreal  Great location in Old Montreal  Very cordial helpful staff  Excellent value too  Highly recommended  
P => Awesome A very nice stay  We knew what we were getting in a Boutique Hotel in a converted bank and we were pleased with what we got  The room was clean and nicely orated  The staff were helpful and pleasant  The food served for breakfast was amazing we ate there every day Yes there is no mini bar or fridge in the room  And no there is no restaurant open for lunch or dinner  If you are looking for these thing look somewhere else  If you want an elegant hotel in a great location stay here  
P => Great Boutique Hotel We really loved the rooms and the staff who were friendly and helpful  Due to limited availability for the three days we stayed in Montreal we stayed in two different rooms one a suite   the other a more standard room    Other reviews knocked the breakfast buffet which was included in our room rate for the suite but it was pretty good for being quotfree quot On the day we did not eat the buffet we tried Eggspectations which is one block away and has great and extensive breakfast options  For those who love fruit in the morning the   fruit plate was fantastic  It was the dead of winter but the plate included mango papaya blueberries strawberries apples grapes bananas and kiwi  The crepes and California eggs benedict were very tasty  Bonaparte located about three blocks away was excellent for dinner  Try the mushroom raviolis The hotel location was great within short walking distance to the metro restaurants and Basilique Notre Dame  It also was within walking distance of the shops on rue St  Catherine This definitely is not a full service hotel  no restaurant for lunch or dinner and not a lot of staff  For example the bellboy is also the bartender  But he was a good bartender and was quick with our bags upon check in and out  Thats what you should expect at a boutique hotel  Its the charm cozy setting and friendly feel that sells this hotel  
P => Fabulous Hotel I travelled to Boston New York QC Toronto and this hotel in Montreal was my favourite  The people were helpful and friendly  There was a problem with my air con so straight away they moved me to a new room with no fuss  Brilliant hotel and so happy I stayed here  The location is also perfect Thanksp s  breaky was the best 
P => Charming hotel in a great location This is a nice hotel in the Old Port part of Montreal  Rooms are nice everything is very clean breakfast included in some room rates is rather good valet parking is convenient included in some room rates  Service is friendly wiill help with restaurant bookings etc Have stayed there several time and will happily stay there again  
P => Charming hotel in Old Montreal This hotel is a great find for anyone who wants to stay in Old Montreal  The hotel itself is very charming orated very nicely and sophisticated is super clean and very comfortable  Our room had all the normal ammenities although did not have a minibar for those who would are wondering  The staff was helpful and the serivce was very good Overall we really enjoyed our time there  Just a couple of blocks away you can eat to your hearts content with all of the yummy french fare Old Montreal has to offer  Try the chez suzette crepe place and Mondave restaurant as well  Mondave had the best bison steak and a pear and goat cheese tart that we loved  Be prepared to walk off all the food you are going to be eating  Also really enjoyed the sailors church not sure of the name def check out the tower portion of it where you get a great view of the city ps I love the hand soap in the rooms 
P => Excellent service Have stayed  nights at the Hotel XIXe Siecle  We experienced excellent service friendly staff and a great room with a cosy and comfortable bathroom  The soaps shower gels etc  were vellousBreakfast is good and very cheap for room service when you order some bits and pieces you dont have to order the set breakfast put up on the menu  For two capuccino a croissant some rye bread and a fruit salad we only paid  CanDollarsExcellent located in the old part of Montreal and within easy wakling distance to the city centre  
P => Well located hotel with a great period feeling My husband teen dhter and I spent three nights at the hotel over the second weekend in ober  We found the property well located the rooms especially the bathrooms very clean the bedding abundant and comfortable and the staff eager to help This is not a quotluxuryquot hotel but has some luxurious touches    including plush terry robes hanging behind the bathroom door a whirlpool tub and delightful high end toiletries beside the sink  The high ceilings be sure to look up and admire the artistry and period or are a delightful change from same old same old of the chain hotels  My only complaint is that the bathroom was small for the three of us but then what hotel has a bathroom large enough to share with a teenage girl I recommend this hotel for its location not only are you on the edge of Vieux Montreal and in walking distance of all the historic and tourist sights but you are also just a few blocks from the Metro which will take you downtown shopping out to the Botanical gardens or over to quotrestaurant rowquot Speaking of food we did not eat breakfast in the hotel too pricey choosing instead to walk a short block to quotEggspectationsquot    a fun funky eatery that will serve you any breakfast food    American Candian French other    you desire  Try the Brioche BeautyDont jump    as I did    to a negative conclusion when the front desk staff recommends a restaurant  It was Friday night  we returned to the hotel late and couldnt get a reservation anywhere else  Reluctantly we let them book us at Bistro Boris  We werent expecting much but it turned out to be a delightful choice  And we are quite picky about cuisine  
P => Great Location Elegant or Friendly Staff Just returned from a week in Montreal at the Hotel XIXe Siecle  I was there for a few days before I realized the quotXIXquot are Roman numerals and the name means th century  Overall I was very pleased and would return  I was attending a conference at the Palais de Congress convention centre and it was only a very short block away  much closer than any of the official large convention hotels  Otherwise I found the location great for seeing multiple parts of the city  its situated at one edge of old Montreal its great for seeing that part of the city and downtown is easily within walking distance to concerts at McGill or shopping or museums downtown  The Place de Arms metro stop is right in the convention center  The staff is friendly and greeted me each time I walked in  Most of time there are one or two very attractive guys to open the doors and help with luggage  There are about eight stairs to go up once one enters the front door so one of the guys carried my suitcase up when checking and checking out  The rooms seem to vary widely in size based on the fire escape map on my door and from what I could see walking by rooms the maid was cleaning  Its likely a consequence of converting it from a bank to a hotel  My room had only one window but rooms with two windows seemed to be bigger  The ceilings and windows are VERY tall and so I did get quite a bit of light in the room  The rooms towards the back of the hotel likely get more light as there is a parking lot next door to the back rooms versus another building towards the front  Though my room was cozy it was adequate in size for me  A friend joined me for the second half of the week and it was a little tight for two suitcases but we managed fine  Shampoo conditioner body gel lotion shoe polisher and haircap are provided  An iron and hair drier were also in my room My rate didnt include breakfast which I think was  dollars  I never tried the breakfast  I ate Olive and Gourmando a couple blocks away or Eggspectatons across the street  Wireless internet works well but it is not free  I paid for a whole week for  or  dollars but you can buy less time as well  Phone calls were one dollar per local call  the price for calls was not listed anywhere and I had to call down to ask how much it would be  There is not an ice machine but you can ask at the bar or front desk and they will get it for you or bring it up to your room  The lobby sitting area is very grand with tall ceilings   can be fun to sit there and watch the comings and goings   My only complaint was that the window was dirty my entire stay  For the most part it is covered with sheers but it annoyed me when I pulled them back  
P => Love this Hotel   will stay here again  We stayed here in y  and liked it very much found it on a travel website  When we ided to go back to Montreal for our honeymoon we looked at one other hotel but ided to go back to this one   what a great ision  Everything that was good about the hotel  years ago is even better now  The service is excellent   everyone speaks both french and english  They gave us some wonderful recommendations for dinners and housekeeping is quiet discrete and thorough  As it was our honeymoon the hotel was kind enough to include their continental breakfast with our room   when we come back here we will definitely opt for this again  Lots of yummy food very filling  The dining room is beautiful tho a little noisy   with its tall ceilings the clinking of dishes does reverberate a bit  We were able to have breakfast a snack in the mid afternoon and then be hungry for dinner  The hotels location is also excellent   right in Old Port one of the more beautiful areas of the city  The Square Victoria Metro stop is about   blocks away and downtown is an easy walk as well  Internet access wifi high speed is available but is pay to play  At  US at the time for  days not a bad deal We are planning on returning here again and we are looking forward to that time  There is no other place we would consider If visitin for the first time consider the following attractions Le Bateau Mouche boat tour the art galleries along Rue St Paul exhibits at the Archeology Museum the Science Museum with IMAX  Parc Mount Royal is also beautiful and worth a long walk  
P => Liked it We stayed  nights at Hotel XIX siecle We liked it Room was not big but very clean and confortable Our rate included breakfast very good and parking Service was good but it is true that there are stairs when you arrive and you have to carry your bagsluggage yourself We really enjoyed the lounge If price is good we would definitely consider staying at Hotel XIX siecle again  
P => Slipshod Service My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Xixe recently with our baby  In general Id give this Hotel a fair rating for very good room size excellent cleanliness and excellent location  What I would give this Hotel a FAILING grade for is service  From the moment we stepped into the hotel we received essentially no help whatsoever  This began with the failure of the staff to set up a crib for our infant  while this generally isnt a big deal if you are arriving with a crying baby at midnight it most certainly is The staff took a leisurely  minutes to bring a crib  The second absolute failure of the staff was there complete lack of knowledge of the neighborhood  After staying there for  days I thought I knew the neighborhood restaurants better than they did  The third example of poor service was the failure of the attendants to provide any help with bringing baggage or our stroller up and down the stairs  On numerous occasions they would just watch us as we struggled with bags and the baby  The only help we received was from another guest Finally at these prices per night WiFI internet service should be complimentary which it isnt This is a very clean hotel with large rooms in an excellent location  Given the level of service it really feels like an overpriced rooming house not a  star hotel  
P => ent hotel nothing special Hotel is pretty clean and staff was generally helpful Room was a good sized and clean  Bed was comfortable and linens were changed frequently  Water pressure was good and the bathroom was stocked with very nice toiletries from the salon next door  The favorite was the green tea soap Everything within Old Montreal was within   minute walk  The metro entrance was a couple of blocks away  The hotel is in a quiet area of town on the weekends  The daylight hours of weekdays seemed to be louder and much busier The streets have low lighting and was near deserted at night Internet access with computer is hard to find so bring your laptop if you need to get online Breakfast is nice but very expensive if its not part of your package  Instead you can just go across the street  Do not ask the front desk for restaurant recommendations  They are very biased towards the restaurants they are partnered with There are a lot of things to see and do around Old Montreal but the real shopping is underground and downtown   which you have to get to via the metro Most everything in Montreal was accessible via their metro which was very well timed and well labeled once you got in  Some points of interestsThe International Fireworks Festival was fantastic which was held at La Ronde  La Ronde itself is a tiny amusement park for kids with long lines for very short rides  It was just a place to spend some time while waiting for the fireworks The Botanical Gardens was huge and beautiful  You can buy the Biodome tickets together but the Biodome is really nothing more than an indoor zoo very disappointing Biosphere is nothing more a skeletal min version of Epcott Center  You can see right through it since it has no panels which can make for a nice picture with the right background and camera  
P => Great Place Hotel XIX Siecle MontrealStayed at hotel from    Exterior of hotel is architectually interesting  Lobby was elegant  Room very large with high ceilings  Everything was very clean  Loved the terry cloth robes  Coffee was offered in the lobby each morning  The staff were very polite very helpful very friendly  In particular Carol and Joel at reception helped us find a nearby store to purchase a cell phone and even mapped it out for us  Even got a great rate on line  Saved  a night off the regular rate  Would return again in a heartbeat  
P => Charming hotel This hotel is very charming inside and out  The staff is very knowledgeable and will help with anything you need  The night staff is especially talkative and can direct you to fun times  I requested a high floor facing the street but was given a floor on the nd floor facing a parking lot   truly an ugly scene  However we  have been lucky because there is massive construction on the street that backs traffic all the way down the street  The room was nice with high ceilings  The bathroom while definately the cleanest Ive ever seen was ridiculously small  There was barely room to put your toothbrush down  The location is only a couple blocks from the square in old Montreal and the Notre Dame but the walk to downtown can get long if youre tired  Overall this is a very nice hotel but I think Id stay ouside of Old montreal in the future due to the lack of nightlife after   
P => Quiet Elegance After staying two nights in another four star hotel that was a disappointment we switched to the Hotel XIXe  Our stay was a very pleasant and delightful experience Although we did not have one of their large deluxe rooms our small corner room painted in warm colors soft on the eyes was outfitted with a firm and comfortable bed with plush pillows and a duvet and a spacious bathroom with high quality toiletries and fluffy white robes  The continental breakfast located in a peaceful and beautiful room with white table clothes and a very friendly staff included the usual  assorted breads fresh fruit cheeses cereals and meats  and was quite tasty  The hotel is close to everything in Old Montreal and we could see the spires of the Notre Dame Basilica from our window  Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful  Wed definitely stay here again 
P => Luxury but not Snooty This hotel was a pleasure  The staff was helpful  The location was superb   close to the old city the river tourist sites  The room was large  The bathroom was beautiful and had a whirpool tub The toiletries were awesome large size soap nice shampoo and conditioner  We had a problem with some plumbing and help was on its way minutes after I called the front desk  Highly recommended  
P => Always a pleasure This is my th time in this hotel  The rooms are of the best I ever been  The bathrooms are always clean and look new  The soaps are unique  The room is excellent with large space for a couple  Excellent location in the heart of the old city  The service is good  Not cheap however always a pleasure 
P => The hotel name should be XIXeme siecle I booked the hotel to attend a meeting at the Palais des congres    which turned out to be one block away  The price on Expedia was   tax    and that came out to about  USD  The hotel is excellent    the staff are attentive    the attention to detail is superb    and the rooms are spacious and really comfortable  Although this part of Montreal is a little noisy the hotel was quiet and restful  It was hot in Montreal this month but the airconditioning worked just great  The people at the desk are amazing    they have a real sense of humor they are helpful and they will go out of their way to accommodate your needs  By the way    this month Madonna came to Montreal and stayed about  block away at the Hotel St  John  That hotel looked similar to the XIXeme siecle  Another note    the name of the hotel is really XIXeme siecle  This is pronounced dix neuvieme siecle    some taxi drivers seem not to know the place because it is small  Just tell them the address on Rue St  Jacques  You are only a block from Notre Dame and  blocks from the grand city hall  And you are really in old Montreal and all the great restaurants are closeby  The Ecole de pasta pasta school is around the corner and it is excellent TomScottsdale AZ 
P => Honeymoon in Montreal My husband and I just got ried and wanted to do something different for our honeymoon  We stayed at the Hotel Xixe Siecle and fell in love all over again  This hotel is great  The rooms are spacious bed is clean and comfortable and the staff is very helpful  The location is also excellent  Not to be missed is the breakfast  We were full the entire day Would definitely stay here again  We had a great time We also took a short train ride to Quebec City  If you can see BOTH cities  
P => Could not have been a better experience I drove up from NYC on saturday of memorial day weekend with my fiancee then girlfriend  We paid approx  night w parking and breakfast included and were pleasantly surprised at how well kept the hotel was  Once we got to the room we were astonished at how big it was   the bed while queen sized was also very plush and comfortable  The staff with the excpetion of one gentleman was so friendly and helpful although he warmed up too after our first day  Although they could not answer ALL of our questions they certainly made an attempt  The bar at the hotel was always staffed and reasonably priced and the breakfast was absolutely incredible If you want to enjoy luxury in Montreal without breaking the bank to do so this is the place And Montreal is a great place to get engaged too I reccomend the Westmount lookout 
P => Very Charming This quiet hotel in Old Montr al is the perfect spot for a romantic get a way  The hotel staff is friendly and polite and very knowledgeable about the city and its attractions  The location is great if you are looking for a quiet retreat with the option to explore the many facets of Montreal  It s a  minute walk to the heart of Old Montreal where you can easily spend a day walking around and enjoying the little shops and architecture and a  minute drive to the Montreal shopping and nightlife districts  There are also several restaurants in the area to choose from The hotel is warm and inviting and provides a very relaxed atmosphere  The continental breakfast is more than that including fresh fruit and juices hard boiled eggs and a variety of cheeses and wonderful pastries We stayed in a Jr  Suite which was very clean and spacious  The or and high ceilings make it feel very grand and the bed was very comfortable  The only bad point was that we were on the first floor and our view was a construction site  We took advantage of a weekend package and while I feel it was not inexpensive I would certainly pay that price again for the ambience and service  Its worth a visit  
P => Loved this hotel My husband and I stayed here one night and just loved it  Cant wait to go back It was very clean and quiet the beds comfy the bathroom spacious the or lovely  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Good location good facilities We stayed here for  nights last tember  The location is great since Old Town is only  minutes away  Our room was rather small and dark but it was relatively clean and well maintained  I wouldnt go back for the hotel experience itself but its good value for the price  So if youre trying to save money and still want good basic quality this place is it 
P => Beautiful Hotel    My boyfriend and I stayed there for a weekend in ember and it was one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in  We werent expecting a king size bed upon arrival but to no disappointment it was very comfortable and we had more pillows than we knew what to do with  There is an open lounge when you walked in the front entrance with beautiful art work and sculptures  We ided to retire to the lounge after our dinner and we felt right at home  The staff were very friendly and helpful  
P => Great boutique hotel in the heart of Old Montreal The other reviewers are spot on We loved the Hotel Xixe Siecle My husband and I stayed here for  nights and thought it was wonderful  The hotels location is perfect   only a block and a half away from Notre Dame Basilica and a short walk to most of the other sites in Old Montreal  Also easily walkable to downtown sights as well The room was really nice too  Super comfy bed with down comforter and crisp white duvet  Very spacious as well with really high ceilings so you dont feel cramped  Nice fluffy towels good bath products and robes tooThe lobby is warm and inviting with comfortable chairs and couches and free coffee is available in the morning along with apples The service was first rate as well  All the staff we encountered were friendly and knowledgeable Valet parking was about  Canadian per night but you have in and out privileges if you need them  Not that youll need a car since everything is so close  I would definitely stay here again if I return to Montreal  
P => Spacious room terrific staff Stayed here for  nights with my husband and  year old dhter  Rooms are large and the very high ceilings and windows contribute to the sense of spaciousness and comfort  Very quiet also  we never were disturbed by noise from neighboring rooms  Bathroom is very clean and unlike an earlier report we had no problem with the hand shower as it is easy to place it in the holder and use as a fixed shower to wash your hair  The location Vieux Montreal is outstanding in terms of quiet charm be sure to go inside the two historic bank buildings in the neighborhood and terrific places to grab a cafe and pastry  The best part of this hotel is the very helpful front desk staff particularly a young woman named Sandy  She gave us great recommendations for places to eat and tour and directed us via drawing on a map andor telling us which Metro line and stop to use  She also made dinner reservations for us  Her patience good humor and genuine desire to find out whether we enjoyed her suggestions makes her an excellent customer service provider  Thank you Sandy I disagree with some of the other reviewers who say the hotel was lacking a certain something  I would be very happy to stay here again and recommend it to anyone who prefers a place with elegant charm  
P => You Certainly Wont Forget Your In Montreal    You know I kind of forgot I was staying at a hotel when I stayed at Hotel XIXe Siecle in Old Montreal The first thing one notices is that the lobby doesnt feel like a lobby  You walk up a short flight of stairs and theres a sitting area with a charming little bar on the side  The interesting artwork comfy couches shelves of books and winding staircase welcome guests as if theyre at a house rather than a hotel  And if youre away from home this is kind of nice rightThe room I stayed in was just massive  It must have been about  square feet and with a  foot ceiling and Im not exaggerating one bit  I was told it was an upgrade because they were quite busy   not bad at all  Id imagine you might not find such a size on the other floors so go for the first level if you can   more space never hurts the weary traveller The bathroom is a bit tight given the fact the room itself is so large  Theres absolutely no counterspace so a definite thumbs down to the hotel developerdesigner on this one Location is superb   For the anti hotel types or claustrophobic   this one is for you 
P => Excellent hotel Spacious and clean room comfortable bed modern bathroom helpful front desk excellent location walking distance to the hustle and bustle of St  Catherine and also near the old town  Only bad thing was the hotel quotrecommendedquot a nearby restaurant named Boris which  have been the worst restaurant Ive ever been  Not really the hotels fault but their lack of knowledge of local restaurants is what prevents me giving this hotel  stars  
P => Wonderful Hotel in Old Quarter This hotel was just about perfect  The room was orated in an attractive manner the bathroom was large and modern the climate control worked great and most important the bed was very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet  Additionally the rooms were huge and the staff excellent  The rates were quite reasonable in comparison to other   properties in Montreal  The only thing I could quibble about was that there was not really a good reading light in the room near the bed only a lamp on a bedsize table which really didnt focus very well but a lot of hotels have that problem and dont think hotel guests ever want to read in bed  There wasnt a minibar in the room either which sort of surprised me given the level of hotel and the fact that there was more than enough room for one  I wasnt staying there long enough that I cared that much but I might have liked to put a few cold drinks in one if I were staying longer  This is a good location for the Old Quarter and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance for a few days but after a while it could be more convenient to be closer to a metro station also  Someone else said Place Victoria was closest and only a couple blocks but my impression was that place dArmes was the closest and much farther than that and down a hill  Its fine if you only want to comego once a day or so from other areas by metro  
P => Excellent The hotel had huge rooms that were very clean and comfortable  The staff was friendly and helpful and their breakfasts were wonderful 
P => Very nice hotel I stayed for  nights in y  The service was very efficient friendly and helpful  The room was a delight  Nicely orated and very spacious  The fixtures and fittings alll were of high quality and new The bar area was quite pleasant and staff made every effort to make it more so by providing snacks and lighting candles  However it was not the sort of bar you would want to stay in for long and indeed most people left after a brief while   no doubt to explore retaurants and bars in the Downtown and Vieux Montreal areas  Breakfast was lovely generous and very tasty  The various fruits in particular were excellent  I would stay here again  The subway was nearby and allowed easy access to anywere you wanted to go  Alternatively there were some very good restaurants and bars within short walking distance in an interesting part of the city too  There was also the main tourist attraction of the beautiful cathedral just a minute away  
P => Charming Property  We stayed here for our Anniversary week end  The property was well orated in a quassai s style The RoomVery clean good sized room with a very comfortable bed  Tall ceilings with windows to match  Bath was new and the toiletries great  My only complaint is the hand held showerhead  These things are truly hand held  There is no option of mounting it so you can wash your hair  I hate these things  After several weeks of this kind of showerhead in South East Asia and Europe I hoped I would never see one again  Alas the hotel Siecle had them  Aside from this little thing I had no other complaints about the bathroom  The towels were exceptionally large and fluffy  The room was very clean and comfortable  For those who smoke the rd floor of the hotel Siecle is their smoking floor  Much to our delight there was no odor  This is the only hotel in Old Montreal that allows smoking  StaffThe staff was always courteous even when they were very busy  We felt pampered and well taken care of for the  days we were there  Directions were always given with a smile a highlighted map and in perfect English  ParkingValet parking is about  Canadian per day and well worth it  Those who travel know that paying extra for parking in any downtown metropolitan area is to be expected  The valet was always prompt and courteous  The car was never left unattended in front of the hotel with the keys in it  If for some reason cars were double parked he would stand street side and direct traffic  LocationGreat location a couple of blocks from Rue St Paul where most of the quotactionquot is  Close enough to walk yet far enough for a good nights quiet sleep while still being in Old Montreal  Warning on driving to the hotel  This has nothing to do with Hotel Siecle and everything to do with Old Montreal Old Montreal is full of one way streets  They do not alternate direction  This is not laid out with a semblance of logic like Manhattan or Philly  Rue St  Jacques the street the hotel is located on is a one way heading toward the hotel from RT   Suddenly the street becomes a one way going in the opposite direction  Turn left If you turn right you will end up on another highway going gawd knows where  This is only your first obstacle  Between the one ways that dont alternate direction horrid street signs and road construction it took us a min of   hours to find the hotel in a  block radius every time we tried to get back to it  Many of the street signs are posted on buildings not on a corner like in the US and nearly impossible to see at night  Rue St  Jacques had no sign anywhere that we could find on the corner we need to turn on to find the hotel  All the street signs in Old Montreal are in small orative French script that adds to the frustration  Some traffic lights were really odd  For example the red light is lit solid while the green light flashes  No arrows  I have no clue what this signifies  Bottom line get a really good detailed map and several sets of directions before you go  With a good detailed map navigating old Montreal would have much easier for us  SumyIf you can find it Hotel Siecle is a great place to stay  
P => Excellent Location and Ambiance Hotel Xixe Siecle is blessed with charming or and is centrally located in the picturesque heart of Old Montreal it is an easy walk from several subway stations as well as a variety of excellent restaurants and eateries The staff was friendly helpful and informative we had one of the corner suites  it was vast elegantly appointed and a pleasure to come home to every night  Our special requests e g  extra pillows were promptly and courteously accomodated and the cold buffet breakfast  which was included in our room rate  was delicious  We were delighted by the variety of edibles from cereal fruits and youghurts to the legendary Montreal style bagels  An excellent way to start the day 
P => Hotel XIXe Siecle Bon jourThis is the second time weve stayed at Hotel XIXe Siecle  We really enjoy ourselves while in Old Montreal and this boutique hotel fits the bill  You can walk or take the Metro to local sites We found out this time around that the facility is WIFI but you will need your own laptop provider and you are given only  minutes of free access  Afterwards you are charged a fee There is valet parking    per night in and out privileges  If you park on your own I believe its  but no in and out privileges Our package included breakfast  per day wo pkg  Breakfast is great  This time around there was a cyclist club and the hotel ran out of the mueslix my fav  The croissants were delicious tooThis year they had some local acts singing in the lounge area  That was a treat The staff is very accommodating with instructions and information  Who knows we  be back again next year  
P => wonderful anniversary the strength of this charming boutique hotel is the staff  extemely helpful and patient  we asked many questions and directions  they also made excellent dining suggestions and reservations  the location is great once you get your bearings  would stay here every time 
P => Quiet elegance perfect service We stayed at Hotel XIXe Siecle for five days in  for a much needed spring vacation  The hotel was near tourist activities but extremely quiet at night  All staff members were courteous and immediately able to answer our questions and help us find restaurants and other services  The standard room was spacious and gave us a great view of the architectural details of the building across Rue St  Jean  We had coffee sent to our room first thing every morning and we never waited more than a few minutes for it to be delivered  We ate breakfast in the hotel only on our last day before heading to the airport and I am sorry we didnt do it every day  Great selection served in a serene room off the street  We will definitely stay there again  
P => This is what a boutique hotel is    I recently stayed for  nights with my partner we both adored the charm and the incredible service of the employees  It was quite the experience and would reccommend this hotel to everyone  The hotel is perfectly nestled in the heart of OLd Montreal peace and quiet once in awhile we would hear a horse carriage go by  The room was magnificent and everything you can imagine for a building that is over  years old  That night we left the staff choose where to eat restaurant Laloux exquisite  All in all the trip was fabulous all thanks go to the staff of Hotel XIX Siecle who treated us like royalty 
P => th Century charm plus st Century style Just returned from  nights last week at the XIXe Siecle  The location in Vieux Montreal is great  just blocks from Notre Dame the Old Port shopping dining and the Square Victoria Metro Station  The staff was great they were so friendly and helpful each day  The European style breakfast is elegantly presented in a stately room by cheery attendants and the croissants are OUTSTANDING We loved our stay there  Other reviews on this site helped me make my choice to stay here and now hopefully I can help you make yours  
P => Charming Hotel This hotel is superb  The charming and handsome concierge who upgraded our room to the master suite at no extra charge was even more superb  I went with my mom for a weekend all of the staff except for one were enthusiastic and patient in providing us with ideas as to what to do at night etc  The style of the rooms is neo classical  post colonial with high ceilings and a large bed the style is somewhat spare and it seems that more furniture could be used to orate the interior The bathroom is clean and well equipped with the requisite toiletries  The complementary breakfast buffet was lovely including cheese hams fresh croissants and bagels Overall a delightful experience God bless the concierge 
P => IT is nice Nice hotel good location  High ceilings spacy rooms  Very clean and helpful staff  Just watch out for the price of the drinks at the lobby bar   they are about  a shot  Overall good value for the money paid  
P => Fantastic place with atmosphere We stayed five nights in ruary in the Xixe Siecle and we would love tocome back as soon as possible Staff is excellentmore than helpful andtaking care of us   rooms are cosy and huge bathrooms very stylish andthe breakfast room is just great Excellent location in Old Montreal closeto nice restaurants  We came from Europe and found a little dream placein Montreal    we can just highly recommend this hotel 
P => A Safe but Boring Choice The building is beautiful it appears to be upscale from the exterior  The rooms are somewhat utilitarian no real style    homey tho youll feel as tho youre staying at your grandparents The staff were not warm or terribly helpful in fact somewhat disinterested  The TV didnt work the water had to run for  minutes before it became hot  I stayed here and at Saint Sulpice    it is lhable that they are listed as same category    the Sulpice is miles above XIX in every way especially as far as service  
P => Heater is so noisy and no respond to your concern I booked one night on expedia for this hotel  Heater is so noisy keep me awake all night  Turned off the heater and its so cold so I turned the heater on again  No water to drink no coffee for the morning  Water for bath is not hot  Room photos shown on the Expedia are quite different from the room I got  I wont even give a try to come back for this hotel  
P => Great small hotel We just stayed at the hotel for a few nights over the New Year  The hotel was better than we expected  We were impressed as soon as we walked into the lobby since it looked even nicer than the pictures on their website  The rooms have high ceilings comfortable bed nice amenities  The staff was also courteous and helpful  We would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Good Place to Stay But Watch the Extra Costs My wife baby and I stayed here in ust  for three nights The staff was very courteous the room was great and the location in Vieux Montreal could not be beat  We ate breakfast every day at a wonderful restaurant called Eggspectation which is just down the street The only thing you should NOT do is ask the hotel to do your laundry  We asked them to do one load and they did it well  However it was outrageously expensive something like  
P => WONDERFUL STAFF WONDERFUL HOTEL  
P => Classy establishment  
P => Great hotel quiet location  
P => Classic Comfort  
P => Would definitely stay here again  
P => Repeat Lodger  
P => REPOSANT  
P => 
P => unexpected detour We had an unexpected detour  Montreal was not in our plans but it happens  The staff at the desk was awusume  Especially one Ginette she did far more that what any one expected  The hotel is on the metro and could not be better located  Thank you Ginette  
P => eptive The remote battery was dead there was not sufficient wash cloths the bed wa squeekyThe service at the desk was rude and snoby The wireless is for a fee A good point were the employees at the garage friendly and helpfulI will not go back again it was very desapointing 
P => Conveniently located in the heart of Montreal and great service  The Hyatt Regency Montreal is located right in the centre of the city of Montreal  It is well connected to St  Catherine Street which is the main shopping street in Montreal which further connects one to  sq  kms of shopping areaThe service is great and the room are spacious and comfortable I highly recommend it to anybody visiting Montreal on business or for pleasure  
P => Great hotel right downtown Very nice hotel  A little confusing to find the lobby if you park in the Complexe Desjardins    but overall very nice room great price and awesome view of quotPlace des Artsquot  
P => Great Location  average hotel Stayed  nights at the Grand Regency at the end of beginning of   I was there for a conference and this was the conference hotel  The adjoining conference center is quite nice and the hotel location is quite convenient to Old Montreal a metro stop etc The hotel is a bit disappointing  My wife and I arrived the first night to discover that they didnt have a king size bed for us after all the reservation had guaranteed it  Instead we were given a single double bed for the first night  After a question about this they gave us a coupon for the breakfast buffet but we would have rather had the promised room  Fortunately they switched it the next day but it took all day to do so and they didnt move our baggage as they said they would The breakfast and hotel bar seem outrageously priced for what you get  Both are OK in quality but not great Locationcleanliness very good to excellent I think you could find much better hotels for the price especially if you arent going there for a conference at that center  
P => Not one of the better Hyatts but nice enough Location wise the Hyatt is front and center to Place des Arts which is usually ground zero for the Jazz and Franco Folies festivals which can be a good thing  Otherwise its location is just OK but it is right on the Metro line  Both times I stayed there I booked through third party booking sites  Perhaps accordingly I had odd rooms  The shower head and tap were in a weird spot and there was no minibar which is always annoying Id like to at least have the option of using it if I want to  
P => Perfect place in Montreal Great location near Old Montreal and other popular areas like St  Catherine and St  Laurent Streets  Comfy and clean and often available on Priceline for a great price  
P => Perfect Fall Getaway I have been a patron of the city of Montreal for many years and have stayed in lots of hotels  However I must tell you this hotel was fantastic in location service and amenities The rooms were clean and comfortable  The service at the front desk bellman valet conceirge etc  were superb  The pool area is excellent with beautiful sliding doors giving access to a pavillion with street views  The only complaint which is really not a biggie was there was no bar service until pm Just wanted to have a couple cocktails but ended up headed out on St  Catherine Street and hangin in the outdoor cafes  I highly recommend this safeparking underneath the hotel friendly and chic hotel to anyone familiar or unfamiliar with Montreal  Please feel free to email me if you have any other questions   
P => Good location good front desk staff Stayed there by myself for a athon and got the executive package which allowed me access to the concierge suite with free apps and private concierge  The private concierge wasnt great as he wasnt around untill pm but the free appetizers was nice Good location and friendly frontdesk  no official concierge so if you have to ask for reccommendation you have to wait in front desk line which could be annoying if they were busy  Very close to good shopping perfect location  
P => ent Upon arriving at the Hyatt Regency we were quite impressed with the beautiful foyer and elegant ore  Wed seen on the website that they offered a romance package and figuring we might as well make bussiness trip double as a romantic weekend away  When we inquired about the romance packagequot there was no such thing to our dis After checking in we realised that a long wait at the elevators was due to only two out of the four elevators were functioning it took over twenty minutes to get past the major line up When getting to our room it was simple an obviously dated hotel that had been given a few modern touches  Nothing spectacular  Spacious bathroom with a narrow bathtub no options to upgrade to a jacuzzi  the room was adequate with a  inch tv and king size bed that was quite firm  The room was clean upon arrival we sayed for three and out of three days our room was only cleaned once cleaning which didnt inclde restocking our minibed or changing the towels as they are only changed every three days to save on cost  When we callled down for clean glasses and fresh towels we were put on hold for  minutes after which we waited another thirty minutes after calling down for a third time we finally had enough and went down to get our own glasses There state of the art gym was lacking in the weight area but is good for cardio  The pool was beautiful and kept at an amazing warm temperature  the lounging area for the pool is beautiful with a terrific sunroom  Right in the downtown area there is tons of shopping options and cabbing is easily done fabulous location All in all we paid a  for a night for three nights stay fabulous location  the hotel is absolute basic no luxuries  My girlfriend stayed one night at  for the same type of room on the same floor and would not do it again  
P => Mixed Emotions    Although well situated in the city this hotel is by no means perfect  If you get a good deal though go for itMost noteworthy   SET UP   As youve probably read in other reviews its a bit of a pain in the neck to navigate this hotel as you first have to take an elevator several floors to the lobby before then doing the same to get to your room  Unfortunately the elevators are a bit schizophrenic  LOCATION   Right in the mix of things   a short walk here and a short walk there  Also situated above a mall with a full grocery store FITNESS  RELAXATION   As part of an apparent reation they clearly paid attention to the addition of a ent workout room with ample equipment  Also the pool and k area were very enjoyable  Be sure to enjoy the sauna and steam area too ROOM   This is where things start to get a bit sad  Although recently reated it looked somewhat worked over   not bad by any means but certainly not what you might expect given a recent makeover SERVICE   A spotty area as well  Check in was a bit of a mess with a line of people and a desk staff that seemed off their game   unable to deal well with the volume of people and a variety of issues  One evening the hotel hosted a wedding reception with music that kept hotel guests awake until  AM  Staffmanagement was ill equipped to deal with this sort of frustration from guests  
P => it will do location its a pretty far walk from old montreal but its walkable  with some connecting stops on the subway you can get to old montreal from the hotel to the champs de s stop  the hotel is located about  blocks away from what id consider to be montreals quotred light district quot it is located on st  catherine street and if you walk a couple of blocks   towards dairy queen you start to hit some ent shopping Eating The diner Eggspectations is right down stairs they make reallly good french toast and the hotel is located right above the Complex des jardins food court  the hotel has a restaurant aswell but it was under reations while i was there hotel small rooms dimly lit basic amenities small bathroom not impressed  wouldnt stay again  
P => Great hotel We stayed here  nights and it was a lovely hotel  We were asked if wed like  double beds or a king bed so we took the latter  The room was spacious and comfortable though my partner had a stiffsore neck from the pillows but I guess he could have brought his own  The staff are very helpful and will tell you where to go if you dont quite know or how to get to where you do want to go ia was helpful and saved us a long walk because my partner was under the impression that it wasnt so far away but it was and Olga recommended which streets to wander for some nice restaurants  The gentlemen at the parking are great too   very nice courteous and willing to help out in any way that they can regular parking is  but each time you take your car out you will have to pay again so we went with valet parking which is  a day We were able to get internet  hours for  and there are various other options for other prices but once we also took advantage of the Starbucks across the street bought some coffees and used their wifi Only complaint   the washroom  Very small but still it was clean and everything although not so much the tub was quite nice  
P => Great reation of this nearly  year old hotel      This hotel started life as Le Meridien and later had a Radisson flag on it before the most recent reation that sees the property managed by Hyatt  In the years since its opening just before the Olympics its Complexe Desjardins location across from Place des Arts hasnt changed but Montreal has gotten more interesting going eastward so the hotel is more central than ever     Kudos to the owners and designers who carried out this reation  Given the age of the hotel  a lot of Montreal was erected in the mid s to mid s for the Expo  and  Olympics and not all has aged gracefully  the refurbishment was a near gut rehab  And a thorough one at that     new and fresh lobby guest rooms lounge areas and fitness center Rooms are not huge but they are ample and airy  The original design of the building sort of a checkerboard pattern provides just half a window to the outside  Supposedly the view I received out over Place des Arts and a slice of Mount Royal is a premium one with a surcharge  the front desk agent gave it to me as  I requested it and  she was not sold out  Very nice of her but the view would not be worth the  per night extra cost  Great Hyatt beds in room coffee and brand new carpet are highlights  Odd that they did not install flat screen TVs given the newness of the reno effort  Bathrooms are well laidout and more pleasant than their size would indicate  Great bumpy Portico soap and curved shower rods are nice touches though the vanity has just one sink and a small area at that Interestingly Priceline categorizes this hotel as a   star while its freshness and amenities would be closer to  star in my book especially given some of what Priceline does call  star  That rating accounts in part for the  US room rate bid that Priceline accepted  a steal for this hotel  It is to the hotels credit that I was treated with VIP service and upgraded even with this  some hotels treat you like the great unwashed if you are a Priceline purchaser The hotel lobby is seven stories above the street and the double elevator rides get a bit tedious  the trip to your room requires an elevator to the lobby then a second set of elevators to get you through the guest room tower The Complexe DesjardinsPlace des Arts location puts guests within underground access to two Metro stations with similar names Place des Arts and Place dArmes the Convention Center and much of the rest of downtown Montreals vast tunnel system  Complexe Desjardins itself is a large mall and office complex the center court is one of the most voluminous retail spaces in the world    with a considerable food court at the lower level  Place des Arts right across St  Catherine St  is Montreals answer to Lincoln Center with a number of performance spaces and the hall for the Montreal Symphony  Chinatown is nearby and the main downtown shopping stretch along St  Catherine is just a few blocks to the west of the hotel  St  Catherine going east from about St  Urbain to St  Denis is the closest thing downtown Montreal has to a red light district and while it is not aggressively awful it is not pretty particularly at night  The gay Village starts just beyond St  Denis about a  minute walk east  And north along St  Denis is the Quartier Latin with countless cafes and restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk  Visitors who take the train into Central Station have about a six block walk Overall the Hyatt can be a great choice particularly when Priceline bids in the   range are accepted  Even at full price the location and stylish reation make this a strong hotel to consider for a Montreal visit Good thingsComplete reation of a  year old hotel stylish and comfortable update Notably central location within Complexe Desjardins for shopping and dining options across from Place des Arts and connected to underground cityconvention center covered access to two Metro stations Brand new fitness facility and pool area with sun k fitness center use freeGreat beds new carpet and numerous outlets nice Portico bath products and curved shower rods Solid service upgrade at front desk despite Priceline booking waived two local calls  charge responsive housekeeping staff Free in cup coffee maker though include paper cups mugs only doesn t cut itRefrigerator not mini bar in room Not good thingsNot in the center of downtown five blocks from core Neighborhood just to east of the hotel along St  Laurent kind of sketchy Double elevator ground floor to lobby then lobby to guest room tower makes for longer time to room  As well frequent elevator stops Despite recent reation retained old style televisions Charge for internet in rooms  
P => Nice Stay Great Pool I stayed for  nights from ust th to ust th with my wife  year old dhter and  year old dhter  The check in was easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful  We found the Hyatt to be reasonably priced and and wonderfully situated  You can walk to all the downtown attractions and Old Montreal  The subway is directly under the hotel and can take you anywhere you want to go  There are many coffee shops with excellent muffins and pastries in the food court in the mall underneath the Hyatt which is only an elevator ride away and very convenient when you are traveling with children  The indoor pool was wonderful  When they opened all the glass doors around the pool we got a beautiful view of the city from the pool area  As one reviewer stated there could have been more chairs around the pool but if thats going to ruin your vacation then stay home  I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family  
P => Worth it on sale     otherwise This hotel does not meet the Hyatt standards  While the staff is nice and the location is great the hotel is run down  The common spaces and rooms are nicely furnished but for a hotel that is supposed to be four star its not  Rooms need money spent to update them i e  flat screen t v s Its difficult to get into the hotel one elevator to the lobby and then one to the rooms but its location makes it worth  a night not much more  Having stayed at another Hyatt property this week I was disappointed with this one  
P => Great for the Hotwire price otherwise    Let me start by saying I usually stay in very good hotels Four Seasons Ritz Carltons yet a friend asked me to try Hotwire for my one night stay in Montreal and I did   plus Internet extra  Well worth it  Nice room ent lobby but the hotel desperately needs updating  Good for a businessman or woman on a one or two night trip  Easily worth the money  Would NOT put my family here  
P => Hyatt Regency Montreal I was recently in Montreal for the Jazz Festival and DiversCite  I was looking for a hotel that was in center town and came across the Hyatt as being in a good location  This hotel is on the corner of Jeanne Mance and St Catherine St right downtown  This offered excellent proximity to great shopping dining nightlife the village is about a  min walk from here  The jazz festival was literally right out side the hotel I had made a reservation for a Deluxe Room with a king size bed  When we arrived they didnt have any available as the hotel as full so we took a room with a double bed and an excellent view of St Catherine St and the Jazz Festival  The room was very nice and clean  The ore was modern and chic  The bathroom was a good size and very well lit  I was in room   The bed was very comfortable and the double size wasnt an issue  Even with two grown men in the bed The hotel staff were very courteous and polite and wanted to make sure that guests had the most pleasant stay and were willing to assist guests in finding attractions and dining options  This hotel also has easy acess to Vieux Montreal and the Metro Parking at the Hyatt was quite expensive however if you pack at the underground public parking Desjardins its not too bad   we arrived after pm and stayed a full  hours   parking came to  CAD They seemed to have a nice pool at this hotel as well however i didnt have a chance to use it Should you have any questions please feel free to contact me  
P => Nice room conviniently situated We booked the hotel with hotwire com and got a nice room with view over St  Catherines Avenue at a very reasonable rate  The room was comfortable very clean and spacious The hotel is situated within the Complex Desjardin adjacent to Place des Arts and St  Catherines Avenue in Downtown Montreal On the downside is that the room was very cold and the aircondition hardly to regulate The doors seemed to be thin so we were disturbed several time at night by noisy people on the floor We were disturbed by the maid although we had the quotprivacy pleasequot sign outside  
P => Blah PROS location direct access to the metro and the Complexe Desjardins mall stylish rooms CONS front desk staff one of the worst Ive seen in any hotel cleanliness cobwebs amp spiders in the room mold in the shower dirty bathroom floor dirty windows no HDTV AC not working accordingly in the room parking inconvenient and expensive no business centre closed because of a fire six months ago   Hyatt is not going to steal me away from Starwood and riott with this oneVery disappointed once again this is not my first stay here and had the same staff amp cleanliness issues the last time around  No more Hyatt Regency Montreal for me  
P => Great base to see the city We booked this hotel last minute on Priceline and got a room for   tax     Price was right for the area  This is a  star hotel as far as service goes  The staff was more than helpful and friendly  The pool was very clean and we were delivered fresh towels by the pool attendant and also given the tour of the sauna and steam room  The balcony outside the pool area is a great place to see the city streets  Yes  you do have to pay for internet but we could not find any place in this city with a free wifi connection including other area hotels  The same goes for parking as with any big city  It was very clean but dated  I would stay here again but  try to get a newer place if possible  We didnt use the hotel much because there is so much to do  We went to sleep around am and used the pool in the morning and thats about it  If you plan on seeing the city the hotel doent really matter much because you wont be there much  The complaints about the elevators are exageratted as well  There is one from the street to bring you up to the check in lobby and then another from there to your room  No big deal  Dont be afraid to stay here  Across the road is an outdoor concert arena with free entertainment  
P => Great Location Disappointing Pool We stayed for just one night for a quick romantic get away  This hotel is in a great location and is only a five minute walk to Old Town Montreal  Overall the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable  The air condition however was very loud and rattled  The biggest disappointment was the pool  After a  hour drive and a frustrating hour wait to get through customs we were really looking forward to just lounging by the pool for a couple of hours  While the pool was equipped with fabulous cushioned lounge chairs I counted only a handful of chairs be  or  and there was no seating available  I spoke to the pool attendent about the problem and she simply shrugged her shoulders  Exacerbated we had no choice but to nap in our room  That I could have done at home  I expect much more from the amenities and services from this class of hotel and will think twice before staying again  
P => A hotel conveniently located We had first made reservations with Hyatt at night for the Jazz Fest weekend  Ended up naming your own price on Priceline and got  rooms for night  Our rooms were on the rd floor view was of a side street  Hyatt was the epi center of the festival and we couldnt have been luckier Although the rooms were standard the hotel staff and its gathering spaces made up for the standard rooms  Wonderful outdoor and indoor common areas nice indoor pool which opens onto a sunk  Indoor outdoor bars great bar menu  We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was worth it  We were not rushed or hurried through our breakfast and it was great to sit relax and enjoy the many many offerings on their buffet  Thank you Jose for your attentiveness to usThe hotel is adjacent to a mall and the mall has every type of shop youll need a grocery store liquor storeliquor stores are government run so all prices at all stores are the same salon clothing shoes   everything We bought some great snacks at the IGA and took advantage of the outdoor space which overlooked the jazz fest  Took a walk into Old Montreal on Saturday   highly recommended  The Basilique Notre Dame de Montreal is a breath taking must see  We stopped off at les  Brasseurs for a beer tasting and bar snacks  Many local shops line the streets and it makes for a great afternoon activity Back at the hotel we ventured to the spasteamsauna    you could get lost trying to find them but they are worth the venture  Spa services such as facials and massages must be booked through the concierge there are no technicians on site and you will need an advanced appointment  We had all good intentions of going to a fabulous restaurant but heavy rains and thunder storms made us re think our plans and we ided to stay put order pizza and talk the night away Our floor was full but oddly we never heard any outside noises with the exception of doors closing it was a quiet floor  There was no concierge on site  but we have to give a huge shout out to Thomas bell hop extraordinaire He took the time to search out places to eat and had them ready for us when we returned later that day  Valerie front desk superstar worked her magic and found  rooms on the same floor for us throughout our stay she took the time to say hello and remembered who we were a nice personal touch  ia was also extremely helpful if and when Valerie was busy  Pietro who helped us with our bags made sure we knew how everything worked in the room  Heather the bartender told us many spots to visit while we were in her town  Granted our stay was perfect because of those that were around us  Thank you to the city of Montreal your people are so friendly 
P => Reviews are pretty spot on   nice hotel great location Like others I was able to get an absolutely ridiculous deal on the Hyatt through Priceline  The location is great the staff is professional and pleasant and its a very nice hotel  The layout is a bit odd my room had no closet it did have an armoire but Ive never not had a closet and the TV was an older model  But for the price I have absolutely zero complaints   it was perfect  One tip   you can exchange money at the front desk at slightly below ket rates but with no commission and in any denomination  
P => Good Location    Good Rate      One Bad night    Overall a Good place We stayed e th to nd for a couples get away  We got a good rate through Priceline  Nice Pool friendly staff although we never did see a conceierge    and a great location  Walking distance to a lot of neat sites  The only bad thing was there was a huge corporate function on the Friday night that kept us awake and also noise in the hallway from grad kids   Saturday and Sunday were quiet   unfortunately management did nothing about the noise when we called   our room was good and we did like the hotel  One tip   try the new Bixi bicycle rental on the streets from the city of Montreal    a real neat way to get around   only  for a hr rental    
P => had a nice comfortable stay Our stay at Hyatt Montreal was just splendid Especially when you are out there on vacation with kids and that too when it is raining outside you have to spen your time indoors  Our experience in Hyatt was very good  The swimming pool the restaurants children enjoyed each and evry bit of their stay  
P => Please Do Not Hesitate to stay here take my word Just got back from  days trip in montreal was great The trip was wonderful plus our stay at the Hyatt problem free  from checked in to checked out everything was smooth the room was clean and beds was comfy  We left our luggages at the concierge after checked out since we need to do some shopping before our  pm train back to Toronto and it wasnt a problem at all the staff was very friendly  I am not really a complaint kinda person but i can tell that if i do ask for something they would do their best coz i seen some ppl was helped with their problems  Please pls pls do not hesitate to stay here despite this Hotel rank at ish If you do get ur hotel room from Priceline then you got a GREAT deal  If not u still will be happy staying here  Hotel is  block away from Via Train station China town with TONS of great foods are  block away fr the hotel  St Catharine is next block and the Gay village are just  blocks away if you come to montreal for nite that  The hotel has some nice facilities but I only use the Gym and it is nice and open  hrs They have a ent size indoor pool  If you want a good stay without spending lots of money for hotel room stay here  But if you are a High Demanded Fancy people stay somewhere else and spend  or more per nite coz you will end up complaning and left a NEGATIVE comments that wont help travellers  Hope this help again Stay here and enjoy your Montreal trip  
P => Reluctant  circle review probably more like   This is a ent hotel    its listed as   given its amenities but I think location and things around it really boost the hotel  For example theres a Starbucks Eggspectation and a whole shopping center close by  So you really have a lot of options for restaurants shopping late night bites etc  no matter the time  I dont think all areas of Montreal enjoy this  Also its close   min walk to both major lines of the metro  Rooms are relatively big pretty standard for quotbusinessquot hotels and the included toiletries are okay Things I didnt like   I guess this is a trend in Canada hotels but there was no safe in the room no minibar at least there was an ice machine on the floor  The lobby and entrance has got to be one of the dumbest and most inconvenient designs I have ever seen  It was definitely quotnoisierquot and not as professional as other hotels yappy cleaning ladies etc  The bar was consistently empty and the front desk was sparsely staffed    usually there was a line  No free internet anywhere but luckily I leeched off an open connection that only happened to work in my room and with my laptop turned a particular way    pretty funny writing the review right now  But I guess most quotchainquot hotels never give away Internet but at least some people have free wi fi in the lobby  The Hyatt had an open terminal in the lobby for general use but it was constantly mobbed So overall this was a good hotel run of the mill business class all the amenities no major complaints but I certainly wouldnt pay full or rack rates  The location really makes the overall experience really pleasant  
P => Great Greata Hotel to stay for Business Travellers  Great Location as well 
P => No free internet in rooms Point formGood location  Great view from room  facing the plaza across the street  Clean rooms  Great beds  Clean pool and gym  Liked the steam room  It is shared between guys and girls  Walking distance to old Montreal  minutes  Payed night on Hotwire  For that price it was a bargain    Tiny bathrooms  Room doors slam shut and that could wake you up at night if people around you get back to their rooms late  No jacuzzi No free internet in rooms In fact it is over priced at close to  per day Front desk gets really busy during day if you need to talk to them  
P => Great location  OK hotel We were looking for convenience with close proximity to Montreal attractions  For that purpose it was very good  There is an IGA store on the same block with shopping and access to ent restaurants on the same block  Access to Cresent Street area Old Montreal and the Latin Quarter all walkable  The hotel is a bit tired  Service at the desk and pool were good  Our room was not cleaned on the second day  All in all it served its purpose  I would not be happy paying top dollar  
P => Location location location This hotel was a bargain at US from Priceline com rated at   stars  We booked two rooms for the  long weekend  After reading other recommendations we opted for quotself parkingquot which was  per day in the mall parkade directly below the hotel  Be sure you tell the valet at the hotel entrance that you are self parking as he will not mention that option  They would prefer that you pay their  rate for valet instead  After making the reservation through Priceline I contacted the hotel directly to request two side by side rooms as well as two double beds in each  No problem  The hotel itself is a bit confusing as the lobby is on the th floor of the building  It is a nice property  prime location on the best shopping street in Montreal  Chinatown is a  min  walk the Old City is  min  It seems like the hotel has had a recent upgrade  or is sleek and contemporary  Our room was spotless with super comfy beds soft sheets and down blankets  Although the bathroom was small it had lovely ble tile floors and tub surround and a black granite vanity top  There was also a little bar counter area in the room  very convenient for preparing coffee drinks snacks etc  Having the mall downstairs was very convenient as there is a grocery and liquor store as well as several food outlets  The pool area is one of the best things about this hotel especially if you have kids  The pool is huge by hotel standards with a nice sauna and steam room and spa like shower and change rooms  My only complaint about this property is that it feels very sterile and impersonal  More like checking into an office building than a hotel  I think it has to do with a shortage of staff  You rarely see anyone around  Check incheck out was very slow and our room wasnt ready until pm   but for the price we got through Priceline this hotel was an amazing deal  I would recommend it highly and definitely stay here again  
P => Good   not Great I travel to Montreal a few times a year and this was my st stay at the Hyatt Quickly   The Good   Location near fun part of town easy to walk around  The food in the Regency Club was good see the bad regarding Regency Club below  The staff was kind and professional  Ivan in Regency Club was very nice The Bad   Executive Club room was very average and bathroom was small and substandard  Alcoholic drinks are not included in price during happy hour at Regency Club so what is the point of drinking in Regency Club   one can get a greater selection by ordering at the bar and bringing the drinks into the Regency Club for the snacks   No concierge so questions have to be posed to the front desk which can get congested Overall it is fine but there are better choices in Montreal  
P => Wonderful Hotel and Staff I am here right now staying five nights     I cant say enough good things about this hotel  I booked this hotel because I am attending several events that are right across the street at Place des Arts  I honestly dont know where some of the posted negative reviews came from  The whole hotel is so very clean and modern  The staff is abolutely amazing  Every single employee I have encounted has been top notch friendly and smiling  Anything I need or want and they are right there  William at the front desk is a gem  He answers all of my stupid questions and greets me every morning by name and with a huge smile  Ivan and Zoe in the Regency Club lounge have been so very helpful with giving me information about what to see where to go and how to get there  My room is on the th floor and has a very nice view of the city  It is very quiet  Everything in my room is spotless and very current  The bed is very comfortable and the pillows are great  The housekeeping is terrific  Every afternoon when I come back to my room everything is replenished and sparkling clean  Everything you need is within walking distance   shopping restaurants musuems the Contemporary Art Museum is right across the street and metro station  Next time I come to Montreal I will definitely stay here again  I have been made to feel very welcomed and have been shown exceptional service  
P => Dingy dark rooms that were depressing I wouldnt recommend this hotel because the room was depressing dark and needed re modeling desperately  I booked through the internet and got a pretty good deal on the room but once I saw the place I was disappointed  The hotel should really invest some capital into new floors lamps and walls  With a little money the place could be wonderful because the location is pretty central  However my husband and I did enjoy the swimming pool and during our two night stay the maid service was pretty satisfactory  
P => I enjoyed my stay  This hotel was fairly standard as others have said  I thought the service in the restaurant was great and ent food tapas style and bar style the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful in orienting us to the city and the location is very convenient  Temperature control is an issue no thermostats and the gym is excruciatingly hot  High speed interent is pricey  Overall I would recommend this hotel  
P => Nice Hotel great location I travelled up to Montreal for a one night stay to see a hockey game at the Bell Centre  The hotel is in a great location downtown  min walk to the Bell Centre directly across the street from the art museum and the Theatre Maisonneuve The hotel rooms are very standard but clean and bed s are very comfortableGreat deal only paid US on priceline com 
P => Pleasant Stay We stayed at Hyatt Regency which I was able to get through Priceline  The hotel is right across Place des Arts where you can access the subway station  I had tickets for a show at Place des Arts so it was convenient for me  However my husband had tickets for a UFC fight and its   minute walk to the Bell Centre and similar distance to La Queue de Cheval Bar and Steak House  There are not many cafes or restaurants around after regular business hours  However its a  minute walk to Chinatown and  minute to Old Montreal  The room was cozy and pretty roomy  
P =>  Star    questionable CONS front desk staff rude dark hallways no bar fridge check in time can vary greatly   so dont expect an earlier one The elevators amp the layout of this hotel is the most problematic  There are  very s l o w elevators to go to the rooms then another s l o w  elevators to go to the parking areataxi stand We didnt eat in the hotel   so I have no idea about the restaurants  SAQ located in Desjardins Complex which is connected to the Hyatt   however you need to take yet ANOTHER s l o w elevator to get to it PROS Clean rooms clean hotel comfy beds Location is fantastic   about   blocks north of old Montreal about    blocks west of Rue St Denis and about  blocks east of Rue Ste Catherine  The shopping on Rue Ste Catherine is AMAZING Quick note   if walking to Rue St Denis on Rue Ste Catherine be aware of several adult entertainment shops     not be the best route for kiddies or questionable tweens 
P => OK value good location chain hotel This was a ent hotel for a two night stay  Very comfortable bed and pretty spacious room with a good view of the city  The location is very central to downtown and the Metro and its connected to the Desjardins Center and the underground city  Upon reading reviews we parked at the Desjardins Center and saved alot of money  Plus we arrived at pm on a Friday night to an unattended valet desk    I was tired and would have just paid for valet but that wasnt really an option  Plus I realized the valets would just put the car in the Desjardins garage anyway its literally right next door sharing the same driveway  So then we tried to find our way to reception from the garage    its on the th floor   I dont think the hotel website ever told me that  Reception wasnt that warm or friendly but the room service staff was very nice Fitness room was better than average and the pool was very popular  Didnt try any of the hotel barsrestaurants bc there are alot of options in Montreal  There is also a ton of roadwork going on in the area   this made driving around the hotel a little frustrating but once youre in its not noisy or anything like that Depending on the rate I  stay again  
P => Location Cant Be Beat Situated on top of a shopping concourse not a cheesy mall with lots of great options for food groceries and drinks  Convenient location for easy access to all areas of interest in Montreal  Downtown Plateau Village and Old Montreal all within walking distance weather permitting or cheap cab ride  Rooms large and comfortable  Lacking only two things for my money   an in room fridge and flat panel TV  Otherwise great stay comfortable convenient  Friendly and helpful staff  
P => Acceptable for Short Stay I stayed at the Hyatt Regency overnight  for a business meeting  Staff was professional courteous and helpful  While I might have expected more from the Hyatt chain the room was adequate with comfortable king bed and pillows ample work area and big window  My view wasnt spectacular due to a lot of construction and high rises  The bathroom lighting problem mentioned in earlier reviews had apparently been corrected but the long narrow and meandering hallways were quite dark and dimmly lit  In the areas around the elevators where the lighting was better one could see the carpet was dingy and filthy  Room amenities were adequate with a lot of space hairdryer iron and ironing board large work desk large TV and ample storage space in the armoire and closet  There was also a hot beverage area in an alcove in the room and a comfy chair near the window  Overall the room was generally clean  Meeting facilities were adequate and the food was delicious though at every meal I always managed to get a dirty glass utensil or plate and had to go through several plates in the stack on the buffet table before finding one without stuck on debris  The wait staff assigned to our meeting was wonderful very polite and made sure every one was happy with their meal  Taxis are stationed at the hotel in their garage and the bellman assists with luggage and calling the taxis to the door  There is also a baggage room for early arrivals and late departure  At Level Two of the hotel meeting facilities the building is connected to a shopping mall and a fast food court just out of the elevator  The down side of my stay was an inoperable telephone in the room dodgy internet service no luncheon room service despite the brochure in the room stating lunch was served     and the hotel restaurant stopped serving at   Had the restaurant still been open when I arrived it would not have made much difference as the only thing on the menu suitable for vegetarians was a salad  My room was almost at the end of a very long hallway and the elevators were notoriously slow  Arriving very hungry from an early morning flight and dinner not scheduled until  PM the food court in the mall was a lifesaver  A general tip for travelers to Montreal be as selective as possible when taking a taxi from the airport  My trip to the hotel was akin to one of the more exciting rides at an amusement park complete with standoffs at intersections and several near misses with speeds of  mph  Luckily the return taxi was quite pleasant with a more mature and professional driver  
P => Not bad at all I felt a little compelled to write a review on this one because I was a little skeptical  Other reviews seems very hit or miss  I agree entirely with the previous review  The lobby is nice pool area is great the restaurant looked nice but I didnt eat there  Service was fine as well  For us what made the trip was that it was attached to the mall  I didnt think this was too big of a perk until I found out that I just had to go down the escalator for a great lunch and breakfast selection late night treats at the grocery store and a nice bottle of wine from the SAQ Quebecs liquor store  Plus travelling with a young child he was able to run around the mall fountain    am without going outside  Of course the location is very central right on Ste  Caterine and about a  minute walk from Old Montreal  Now for the actual rooms  I thought they were fine  A closer look and there is definately some wear but nothing to be concerned about  As with the previous review mine is a little skewed because of the great rate I received but a solid choice none the less   
P => It is a business hotel   nothing fancy nothing terrible  This hotel is located just a few minutes from downtown Chinatown old Montreal  The hotel looks like it had a reation  years ago  The lobby area is well orated and pleasant  The rooms themselves were also reated although it doesnt look like they put much money into them just a refreshing  The hotel itself looks like a large block of concrete  While I don t think it will any architectural awards it is not as ugly from the outside as some previous posts have suggested  The hotel sits above a large shopping mall and has direct access without having to go outside  This is very convenient  There is a large food court wine store and an IGA superket as well as the usual mall brands  My review is in part influenced by the fact that I got a very very cheap rate on Hotwire for this hotel a fraction of the advertised rate  If I had to pay full rates for this hotel I would have shopped around to see if I could find a better hotel for the same money  The bottom line is this this is a business hotel  You wouldn t stay here if you were looking for an amazing service experience try the W hotel or Intercontinental instead  However if you are looking for a business hotel which has what you need and wont break the bank this is a good candidate  
P => OK hotel   recently reated Stayed here for  nights and thought it was an OK hotel  Staff were good room had obviously had a recent minor Hyatt makeover  It was definitely overpriced though when compared with similar priced Hyatts eg Vancouver and had some super expensive parking Likes  Great staff very knowledgeable and helpful  You can use the underground streets connected to the hotel to avoid going outsideDislikes  Could have done with a more substantial makeover looked like it was done on the cheap  Paying for everything Wifi parking etc  Pricey for what it isOverall I dont really have any huge feelings either way about this hotel  Didnt love it didnt hate it  Oh and its the only Hyatt thats never credited my points even after  months and  follow up reminders 
P => Nice hotel with great location but guest rooms need work My husband myself and two young kids stayed at this hotel for  nights in ruary  The lobby is nice staff friendly and the hotel is in a great location with access to a mall via the hotel elevators  The negatives were the guest rooms as the bathrooms needed updating ie  the shower  I did not think they were up to Hyatt standards  The elevators were not cleaned regularly  The hotel restaurant is not open for dinnner which made it difficult with two young kids as the mall downstairs shut around pm during the week  On the positive side the pool is great Have to be honest though upon entering the guest room my husband and dhter insisted they could not stay in such a room however did adapt after a night or two  
P => Clean comfortable and great location We were able to book this hotel for a bit less than  CAD all in with Priceline  The service staff were very friendly and accommodating for our early check in  The room was clean bed super comfortable and the shower top notch Its a great location and a short walk to key areas  We parked at the shopping mall complexe Desjardins for  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to MTL and would go back again 
P => Fab location average hotel I stayed  nights at this hotel in early uary   I booked through Hotwire at night The room was nothing special  It had a king size bed older TV sparse or  It was a bit of a let down considering it was a Hyatt  The main problem in the room was the shower  The water temperature constantly changed from hot to freezing despite attempts to adjust accordingly  The tub was also a disappoinment narrow and shallow like an apartment tub The restaurant was not open for dinner during the time we were there  There is some food available in the lounge adjacent to the lobby Parking is day with no in out privileges or day valet with in out privileges  Wireless internet is available at  day On the plus side this hotel offered excellent service  The staff were very willing to please and efficient  There is a beautiful pool area and gym  The location is fantastic  It is adjoined to a mall with easy access to the Metro and the underground network of tunnels especially nice when its freezing cold outside  The hotel is really close to shopping restaurants museums and the Old Montreal district  I would stay here again based on the location although I would never pay full price  See if you can get this through Hotwire or Priceline and you will be satisfied  
P => This is NOT a  star hotel The Hyatt bills itself as a  star hotel  Whats  star about it Dont get me wrong   theres nothing hugely wrong with it  And I cant complain about the US we paid for our room on Priceline  But this place is extremely average Our room was on the th floor next to the pop machine and oddly shaped because of the buildings ugly s architecture  On the positive side the bed was very comfortable as at all Hyatt Regency hotels  But the negatives far outweigh the positives  First off there was hardly any light in the room  Inexcusably for a room with a king sized bed there was only one bedside table and lamp  Aside from this lamp there was a floor lamp a table lamp on the smallish desk and a small halogen potlight over the coffeemaker area  In the winter light the room was depressingly dim during the day and at night reading on the non bedside lamp side of the bed was out of the question  The TV was at least  years old  Under the TV there was space in the cabinet for a fridge but no fridge  The bathroom was OK but didnt have an exhaust fan  All in all not a four star room at all The rest of the hotel seemed fine  The staff were friendly and the gym was clean and well equipped The hotel charges  for parking but theres no reason to pay this  On weekends parking in the Complexe Desjardins garage the hotel is on top of a large mall is  a day  There are also a couple of outdoor lots across the street where overnight parking on weeknights is  for up to  hours Also there is no reason to pay  for the hotel breakfast  Theres an Eggspectation across the street and a food court in the mall downstairs  
P => Location Couldnt Be More Pefect My husband and I booked the Hyatt Regency for a one night stay on Boxing Day en route to Mt  Tremblant  We got a very reasonable rate via Priceline  Arrived at the hotel around pm and was checked in right away  We parked in the mall indoor parking lot for  which was a bargain compared to the hotels valet parking of day  The indoor lot is very clean brightly lit and heatedWe were given a room on the th floor  closest to the elevator  We werent able to hear the elevators or traffic in the hall as the room had a second door leading in Our room had a king sized bed with soft clean linens  The mattress was a pillow top and absolutely one of the most comfortable Ive slept in  We had a nice view of St  Catherines St and the art centre across the street Unfortunately since we were out most of the daynight and left early in the morning around am we didnt get to use the pool or gym facilities  The location of the Hyatt is the best   right on St  Catherine St  just steps away from shopping restaurants and the Metro  I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting Montreal for the first time and wants to stay somewhere central  Ive been to Montreal several times before and wished I had stayed at this Hyatt  
P => Super convenient for a weekend stay   and loved the pool Booked via Priceline for  all inclusive  Arrived on a Friday and check in was courteous  However was given a room which was not cleaned   problem fixed quickly however  The room was smallish although nicely orated  The king bed was extremely comfortable slept in well on Saturday  The bathroom could have used a better cleaning and the bath fauced leaked a bit  Toiletries were of good quality  Internet connection was CAN per day but did not take it The highlight of my stay was the gym fully equiped with LCD TV for cardio and a good selection of machine for musculation and a very large and deep pool with friendly attendant  The changeing room was quite nice with glass doors leading to a coed steam room and dry sauna  The restaurants were rather expensive  continental buffet so I went downstair to the Complexe Desjardins food courts where you can eat a ent breakfast chose Frankies Hot Dog  eggs and sausage and toast for   There is also an IGA superket and a Uniprix pharmacy  The elevators were a bit inconvenient to go from the hotel to the mall  When its cold outside take advantage of the Underground city  As for parking use the Complexe parking not the hotel  Parking starting Friday at PM is  for  hours left my car there for most of Saturday as I arrived at PM the day before  This is a great hotel close to the mall and the metro with a great gym and pool  
P => Watch out Just arrived and it only took us one and one half hours to check into our room  I paid an extra   per night for a Regency Club room which was advertised as being on a restricted floor with a concierge and lounge for appetisers and breakfast  It was also advertised to be recently reated with an enhanced working area  Our room was not ready even tho we arrived at   We were sent to a room without robes enhanced toiletries or many of the amenities we were told would be included  We then waited for  minutes for another room to be cleaned  This room has no refrigerator as advertised the sony cd radio is in fact an old g e  without cd let alone ipod capability and the furniture in here is like something out of Motel  chipped and scratched and not much room on the desk for a computer in addition to the the lamp and phone  The manager has promised to send a fridge and cd radio up to the room but Im still waiting and when I asked about the misinformation on the website he said that he had asked Hyatt many times to change it and they have refused  There is mould in the grouting in the bathroom as others have commented  They did supply the robes and enhanced toiletries  The location is good but there are a lot of other hotels in this area so I really cant see returning and if they dont follow through on the promises I  just check out tomorrow instead of staying for two nights  
P => Fine Hotel but Wi Fi Not So Great Stayed here for work conference that was at nearby expo hall  Bought the business plan through Expedia that offered Wi Fi and breakfast each morning  The breakfasts were very good and the cafe staff was very efficient so I could have a good start to my days  I grew tired of the lobby elevator  It was slow and crowded and it seemed silly to not have stairs to get down one floor to the street  I agree with another poster that the TVs are fairly ancient  All told the hotel has a great location the staff was uniformly good  My only problem was with the Wi Fi reception or lack thereof  The phone tech support for the Wi Fi provider was great though it didnt really help me get a better signal  They didnt feel that moving me to another room would help  I was able to get good reception in the hotel bar but as I had a number of work related things to take care of in the evenings it would have been nice to get them done in the privacy of my room  Again great location   close to funky shopping Chinatown museums  If I came back for a real vacation I would definitely stay there again  
P => Better than expected Using Priceline I booked two nights at the Montreal Hyatt at a great price  Reading Tripadvisor after the booking I was a little concerned  Upon checking in I presented my Gold Hyatt card  I was given a room on the th floor that was very nice  It seemed to be recently reated The washroom was clean and bright  The room also was very nice  The only minor complainant with the room was the circa  Zenith  inch television sitting upon a very nice wardrobe  Although I don t watch much TV it is nice to have a ent LCD  The location of the hotel is great street weekend parking is available  The hotel has a basic lobby not very impressive  You take an elevator from the street to the lobby and another elevator to your room a minor inconvenience The front desk service was fair but there is an on going strike with some staff  It would recommend that you ask for a reated room if you stay at the Hyatt  
P => Fantastic This place is just the total package  The room was fantastic the amenities perfect the location ideal and the staff superb  The details are all taken care of right down to the Erl Grey tea instead of that orange crap dished out at most hotels  I arrived a bit early  and my room wasnt available so the hotel gave me a couple caesars doubles on the house  When I got up to the room I was truly pleased at the cleanliness and upscale look  I do a ton of business travelling and this place is heaven for a business traveller  Its connected to a mall that has everything youd need including a really handy liqour stor I cant say enough about this place  For the business minded this is THE place to stay  
P => Mixed experience somewhat with this one Overall I cant say I was disappointed with this hotel  But definitely there some things which I was VERY surprised about with this one First the pros Absolutely amazing location cant be beat  The hotel is in the heart of the city with everything around you within pretty much walking distance  Below the hotel is a mall with a food court  You didnt even have to go outside to go shopping or get some food it was all there  Of course if you chose to go outside there were many more options as well  Beds were very comfortable and the room itself was overall quite pleasant except for the cons below  These are the big big pluses of the hotel Now the cons For a   star per Priceline I was appalled at the furniture in the room  It was in short   old and plenty usedscratched  I have never seen such old used furniture in a hotel of this calibre  Secondly the hallways were very dark  Thirdly and another absolute shocker the washroom was very dark and not only that had lots of grime in the grout in between the wall tiles and some of the areas around the tub  As well it seemed as if the wall tiles in the tub area had been permanently ked by the water or something because they looked like they were in major need of sand blasting or something  Very bad condition of the wall tiles as well as the ground tiles which had cracks here and there  Parts of the washroom reminded me of something youd find in a  star motel Overall as mentioned we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and I gave it a rating of  principally because of its location and connection to shoppingfood but have to admit I could not believe some of the things I was saw in this hotel considering its class  
P => Perfect We booked the Hyatt through Hotwire for  including taxes which was awesome  The location is absolutely perfect right downtown literally on top of a mall  Chinatown is just around the corner and St  Catherine St  is also right there  As far as the hotel itself friendly service everything in perfect condition comfortable beds etc  The only thing i can think of that approaches a complaint is that it was kind of confusing to get to the lobby  We had gone to the mall first and had to search for a while to find the right elevator then a little more to get to the reception desk from there  Thats pretty minor though  Friendly staff modern or comfy spacious room and GREAT location 
P => I loved this hotel I stayed in this hotel since I was in Montreal for a Congress in tember   The hotel was so comfortable and had everything I needed  The breakfast was included in my price and was great  They had bagels yummy Montreal Bagels fresh fruit freshly made omlets good meat and chese selection  The staff were very professional  The hotel is located in a great location in Montreal  Minutes to museums shopping congress centre and I even walked to old Montreal at night and back  The rooms are superb  Clean  Nice  Best bed ever  Great shower  Nice and friendly cleaning lady I feel so bad for forgetting to leave her tip and free internet  The gym is fab and it offers yoga classes All and all I highly recommend this hotel for a city or work trip  
P => not as nice as it looks on the website I stayed here for  nights and was not impressed  some of my complaintsI had problems seeing in the bathroom bc it was so dark I had a water leak under my sinkMy room card somehow got deactivatedThe elevator system is crazyhowever the bed was SO COMFORTABLE the gym was good the location was great and the concierge Benoit was excellent 
P => Horrible horrible The interior of the hotel is rather dark and dingy  The rooms are nothing special if large  The hotel claims there is wireless internet in every room but this is completely untrue  My room had no signal at all  Several other people I asked had either weak signal or none at all  When I asked the desk clerk to change my room to one with a better signal so that I could work on some assignments due in a few days she claimed that I was wrong and then gave me some incredibly bogus advice on what to do  quotTake the computer into the lobby connect to the internet there and then take the computer back to your room  Many guests have tried this and it worked for them quot I performed these antics only when she told me she would switch my room if it didnt work and when it didnt of course she changed her mind and refused to switch my room  Lovely  The tech phone support although friendly was also no help  The one nice thing I can say about the hotel is that the workout room is well equipped and always open  However it is ruined by some very LOUD pop music played through the rooms sound system  The controls are locked in a closet and you cannot turn the volume down or change the channel  There is an hotel phone in the workout room and after suffering through yet another American idol style rendition of a beloved soul classic I could take no more and I called the hotel operator to ask for assistance turning off the music  A few minutes later a manager appeared who unlocked the room and turned down the music a smidge  I asked him to turn it down more but he refused saying something about hotel policy and satellite radio  He was so smug and self important about it that I began to suspect that for him saying quotnoquot to middle aged American lady scientists was an unanticipated and highly enjoyable perk of the job for him  
P => Its The Place to Be The Hyatt experience started off with a great deal on Hotwire and things just got better and better  This location should be the envy of the city a five minute walk to beautiful Old Montreal five minutes to the financial district and across the street from the Metro Station  In the middle of all the restaurants and shops the Hyatt also is the host of all the best festivals and activities like the world famous Jazz Festival  Not to mention the Hyatt is connected to an underground mall  The room is typical Hyatt with all the signature amenities and of course the Grand Bed  A nice touch is the balcony off the lobby this serves as a great place to have a drink and people watch  To keep out folks just wondering around the hotel has staff at the entrance during busy times to check room keys for extra security  The bottom line is the Hyatt is a great choice and a good value if you can score a deal under   
P => Enjoyed our visit Stayed for a couple of nights during the comedy festival and the hotel was VERY busy  However the staff were wonderful and extremely organized  It is in a great location within walking distance of Old Montreal and many other attractions and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Montreal  
P => Great Location great room We got a great deal on Priceline for this hotel  We spent three nights here  The location is very good close to the old city Chinatown St  Catherine the Contemporary Art Museum and various neighborhoods  The room was large with a great view of the city  The hotel was a little difficult to get out of you had to take two elevators to get to a shopping center on the ground floor then find your way to the street  But it was good having the shopping plaza in the same building there was a large food court an IGA superket a bank and lots of other stores there  Parking was expensive at  a day for self park  its  a day if you use the valet  The staff was helpful but didnt know about some of the arts venues we were looking for  The experience was outstanding for the  a night price on Priceline  
P => Hyatt Not As Good As Other Montreal Hotels The room was very comfortable with a nice clean bed and the small window which didnt open had a very pleasant view of Mont Royal and the Place des Arts  But there was one thing that soured my entire stay    the internet situation  Not only did the ridiculous  per day charge annoy me for wireless access but my connection was all but nonexistent in my room  When I called the front desk to inquire about a remedy they first suggested that I pay  to upgrade to a Club Level room so that I could use the computers in the Club Lounge  And this after I had already paid for access I found my own solution    going to the lobby where my paid access worked  But what really ticked me off was when I asked the concierge if there was a place for free WiFi and he said that he didnt know of anything    and by chance I found out that the coffee stand in the mall just below a ten second elevator ride away offered free WiFi  Clearly the staff is trained to milk every last cent from guests  Such a shame because the rooms are nice and the hotel is in a great location  
P => Another Great Stay at the Hyatt for Next to Nothing We love Montreal and when we dont need a suite we have been using Priceline to book our room  We are familiar with all the hotels on Pricelines  star Montreal hotel list which you can find at biddingfortravel so we dont think its a risk to do so  Theyre all fine  Three times now we have been lucky enough to get the Hyatt  It is directly across from the Place des Artes which is not only a cultural center ordinarily but also the hub of the fantastic Jazz Festival in late e and early y  From here its an easy walk to shopping on St  Catherine Dining on Cresent or in Chinatown or strolling through Old Port Check in is always a breeze  We ask for two beds non smoking and a room on a high floor away from elevator and ice machine noises and we have always been accomodated  The pool which is on a rooftop but is at a lower level than the top of the main tower has a glass ceiling with a nice view of the city and outdoor lounging if you want that Rooms are well appointed and corridors are clean and bright  The only thing I miss from the Delta up the hill is a newspaper outside my door in the morning  Still these are available in the lobby I wrote a short article about this hotel which includes lots of restaurant tips  You can find it at httpwww helium comitems montreal habit forming festival We are foodies and spent a long time compiling these suggestions  Every one is worth trying and they will bring you to different parts of town all worth seeingDont hesitate to book the Hyatt and try priceline  We got it for  this time  Amazing It will be more in summer but still a good deal  
P => Good Price and Location    had a great time Just got back from spending Victoria Day long weekend in Montreal  The Hyatt was great  Booked on Priceline at night stayed Sat and Sun night  Check in was a breeze the room was spotless and we had no problems with noise  The only negatives were that the pool was closed and our view was crummy Loved the food court on the second floor the hotel lobby is on the th floor of the bldg  Lots of diverse optionsWe parked in the bldg Complex Desjardins  There is an elevator connecting the parking lot directly to the hotel lobby   very convenient  I wouldnt bother with valet parking  We arrive Sat at  parked til Mon at   Total charge was  Lobby staff provided free maps of Montreal  It was a  min walk to old montreal  The area around the hotel is definitely not seedy as some have posted  We felt safe at all times  Old montreal is filled with art galleries shops and cute restaurants in old stone bldgs with courtyards  TONNES of dining options I cant believe people have posted things about poor lighting strength and having to take  elevators to get to the street  I guess some people will compliain about anything For the price   its an awesome deal  
P => A good but not great experience Although the location interior or and service at this hotel was superb there are two main reasons why my rating is neither excellent nor above average  My first complaint is that the pool was shutdown for repairs  This issue would not have bothered me as much if I had expected it but since my reservations and the hotel website made no mention of their repairs I was definitely disappointed  My second issue with the Hyatt is their provision of wireless internet as an extra charge  Why a four star hotel would not offer this service complimentary is beyond me  There are a few  star alternatives within walking distance that have both a working pool and free internet which has negatively influenced this review  Aside from these caveats my stay was comfortable and relatively convenient  However there are more economical and higher quality alternatives in the area  
P => Location Location Location I got this hotel on Priceline for  and it was a great value for the price The location of this hotel is simply awesome  It is right on the main Catherine street and everything is within walking distance  The old town area is just about a  min walk  The hotel is connected via underground to  metro lines  Also there are several buses which stop just outside the hotel   You can get a  day tourist pass for  and travel unlimited on the metro and buses  I would recommend using public transport since parking is pretty expensive in downtown I took the Aerobus from the airport and it dropped me right at the doorstep of the hotel The room was very nice  I agree with other reviewers that it needs better lighting  The pool area was closed for maintenance   The restaurant has excellent buffets for all meals The hotel is attached to a mall and there is a large food court below the hotel which has a great variety   Thai Indian Chinese Sushi Greek Burgers Sandwiches Mexican  Coffee DessertsItalian  they have it all  There is also a superket which can be useful Overall a great hotel with a superb location  
P => Solid Experience Good Value  I booked the Hyatt Regency at USDnight  CDNnight including all taxes  fees on Priceline and it was rated a three star hotel on the site  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel when I checked in and the furnishings and quality of the room are definitely at four star level  Check in was quick and painless   I was given the choice of a king or two doubles without asking and while the pool amp sauna were out of service during my stay which was disappointing the remainder of the stay was quite good  For those on a budget you do get dinged with incidentals such as local phone calls call and internet service WiFi access is day  There was no bar fridge in the room Location is outstanding   you are linked directly underground to the metro and the underground complex which is especially convenient when the weather is less than ideal and youre right on Saint Catherine when you want to get out and explore downtown  
P => Pleasant Stay I booked this hotel through priceline I got a very good deal with nightI went with my mom for a road trip from NYC to ottawa amp then to Montreal  It was very nice  We loved the hotelStaff very friendly and will do their best to help  We had a tour to quebec and we have missed our shuttle to be taken to the tour office so they called them and had someone come just to pick us up and take us to the tour office Rooms Modern very comfortable bed room service is fast and reasonable price  The only thing I would suggest is more lights in the room the room is kind of dimBreakfast Buffet was beyond imaginable excellent food and service and reasonable pricesThe only thing I would complain about is the elevators We went at the time of the film festival so there were alot of people and the  elevators were not enough for the crowds we basically waited   minutes just to get an elevator on the floor The location of the hotel was nice we were able to walk to Old Montreal and to Notre Dame   We also loved the mall that is connected below the hotel  I would definetely go back to this hotel in a heartbeat especially with the great rate we got it for  
P => Superb Location and Quality I just returned from a  night stay at the Hyatt Regency Montreal and I am so pleased to have stayed there  Montreal has over a  places to stay in its downtown core and I researched many choices before selecting the Hyatt  The location cannot be beat  It is linked underground to so many essential services the Place des Arts metro the Palais des Congres the SAQ Liquor store IGA superket and so many other shops in the Complexe Desjardins shopping mall  The rooms are gorgeous  The beds are very comfortable and plush and the room layout and space was perfect  The bathroom is small for  people getting ready together but the spacious shower and luxury bath amenities more than makes up for that People have complained here about this property but after my stay I disagree  The pool is gorgeous and the breakfast buffet is simply outstanding  Front desk staff are most friendly check in and out was very efficient  The price is on par with other  star hotels but its location and underground linkage is very convenient for business travellers or tourists wishing to use the Metro Montreal is a world class city and when I return I will definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency  
P => Okay  Stayed at the Hyatt over Easter  Location was great and bed comfortable  Dining terrace which was under snow looked like it would be very nice in the summer  Only complaint was that the room only had a series of very dim table and floor lamps no overhead light so at night it was dim in the room  Otherwise was fine  I prefer the Hilton and Sheraton for this level of hotel nicer toiletries nicer pillows etc  but it was fine for what it was and we got a great deal on the price so cant complain  
P => Good overall Staff were friendly and attentitive and upgraded our room for free as they had the space available  We had a great view and I loved that there was a mall underneath the hotel We were on the th floor and there were two things I didnt enjoy  First was that the bathroom fan didnt work leaving undesireable odor in the hotel room whenever someone used it and second which I understand was not the hotels fault    our room was right beside the staircase and someone in high heel shoes on the th floor was walking back and forth on the staircase all night long from  pm untill am    we called the front desk at  pm but that didnt solve the problem  When we checked out the next day we complained and the hotel didnt charge us for room service amounting to  bucks and gave us a free breakfeast    thanx but I would have rather had a good nite sleep considering I had to drive  hours home  
P => ent Hotel   There are better I stayed at the hotel in the beginning of   for my friends birthday Experience at hotelThe hotel staff was nice enough but didnt get the room I had requested  Front desk told me the rooms were unavailable manager said they were under construction and the maid staff told me they were just empty but available  Inconsistency was their policy  At first it angered me they couldnt accommodate my request but for the price I paid couldnt complain too much longer  Other than that the experience was OK Hotel Its a nice and modern hotel  It has great potential in the summer with a large patio and pool  Rather inconvenient to take  elevators to get to the room  But in fairness the elevators were quick RoomsRooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable  Probably one of the best features of the hotel  The design is very appealing  The view is nothing special from the th floor  The LocationNot the best location but it was good  Located above a mall with a good food court for quick meals  Close to St Laurent and St  Denis where you can find some good bars  I think the West side of downtown is a much better location in terms of atmosphere  OverallIts a ent hotel and if you can get it at a good price then its definitely worth it  I personally would have spent a little more for a better hotel elsewhere  be the Delta Montreal or Hotel du Fort  
P => Great hotel but so so area We recently stayed in Montreal and during that visit we stayed at both the Hyatt Regency for one night and the riott Residence Inn Downtown for two nights  The Hyatt staff was very helpful with our early check in providing maps baggage storage and hailing taxi cabs  Our room was located on the th floor so we had no street noise to keep us up at night and the room was very clean  The hotel also has convenient access to the Place d Armes and Place des Arts Metro stations through the Complex Desjardins underground shopping area  However the location was not as appealing as I wished it would be  From our room window the views included buildings with colorful graffiti  There also did not seem to be too many restaurants or shops in the neighborhood other than the Complex Desjardins  We actually liked the neighborhood surrounding the riott Residence Inn Downtown much better  However just as a reminder we were only at the Hyatt for one night so if we had stayed longer we  have encountered some hidden treasures if there are any  
P => Nothing above avarage This hotel doesnt offer any more or any less than you should expect from a  star  It is functional good sized room very comfortable beds and neutrally orated  Bathroom could do with some refurbishing but it was ok The only thing that I found a bit petty was the business center which charged for the use of the internet  I stayed in four other hotels during this trip and Hyatt was the first place that didnt offer complimentary use of this service  When you pay the full price for your stay it is annoying to see they still want more  
P => Its a Hyatt   Really We stayed at the Hyatt for a few days over New Years Eve   just returned yesterday  Wow was it disappointing for a Hyatt  The only positive thing we have to say about the Hyatt in Montreal is its location  The front desk is terribly rude snobby and condescending  The rooms are in need of renation  The sink in the bathroom didnt drain well  The bathtub water would change from hot to cold to hot on a whim  If you want a mini refrigerator in your room you have to pre reserve it  Apparently its not standard at this Hyatt   at least thats what the front desk manager told us  Its more a   star than  star hotel   and honestly mostly because of the poor front desk  I will not be staying here again   ever  
P => Great Room for the price Booked the hotel through hotwire  Went during the xmas holidays and the room came to  US w taxes  Definitely a great price for the room Only stayed for one night as I was just in Montreal for a party  The hotel is in the Complexe Desjardins and situated really close to St  Laurent amp St  Catherines  Less than a  minute walk to great shopping restaurants bars amp clubsDidnt get a chance to really use any of the amenities but the rooms were nice and clean and washroom was spacious  The hotel was easy to find and had public and valet parking for somewhat a reasonable rate Would definitely stay there again  
P => Pretty nice I got a steal on this hotel through Hotwire for around   a night so I was happy to begin with  Upon arriving I found the hotel in nice shape the front desk attendant very friendly and helpful and the parking after figuring out the garage situation was convenient too  The rooms were very nice as well  The beds are loaded with comfy feather pillows we had a great view of the skyscrapers and a very nice yet very dark bathroom with granite countertops and beautiful Kohler fixtures Using the interent was a bit of a hassle as it took forever to work and had poor connection speed  I also feel that a supposed  star hotel should not be charging their customers for service  I get free internet at Fairfield Inn for Gods sakeThe location was great for shoppingdiningnightlife on St Catherine and not too far from the old buildings of Old Montreal Overall I was quite pleased with the hotel and would have no qualms about returning although I would probably rate it closer to a   star rather than a  star  
P => Pleasant Stay This is a nice hotel  Very convenient to the Convention Centre Palais De Congres and the shopping on Rue St  Catherine  The hotel itself is actually part of the Des Jardins shopping complex which houses a very nice superket with lots of prepared foods and a food court both at basement level  Rooms are large and nicely orated in browns and beiges  The toiletries provided are very nice though I found the bathroom to be somewhat dark  The breakfast buffet is extensive and tasty but costs an extra c Can Wireless Internet access is available for a c Can per day fee  The hotel will happily hold your luggage after you have checked out for no extra cost  And its possible to sit in the generally quiet lobbybar area after check out while waiting for a late flight without any hassle  
P => Great Hotel My husband and I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal to celebrate our anniversary  This is our nd stay at the hotel we also stayed last year for our anniversary  This is a wonderful hotel  The rooms are luxurious spacious and well kept  The breakfast buffet is terrific and the service was top notch too  We would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Smooth I have booked this hotel through Priceline com for a lhable  CAD incl  The hotel was impeccably clean very professional service at both reception and concierge desks  The hotel has a not too large swimming pool which we didnt try but the pool area is perfect for relaxation to read a book or listen to music  Its like summer all year around given its sunny outside  The room was super clean ble sink very comfortable pillows and mattress  Channels on tv are mediocre coffeemaker very small unfortunately  cup at a time The fact that the hotel is connected to the mall gives you the choice of dozens of places to eat practically in your hotel down in the food court at very reasonable prices  If you can get this hotel for a price like ours go for it Location is just perfect for shopping  
P => Average for a Hyatt We chose this location because it was in walking distance of Palais de Congress Convention Center  Also we were close to shopping and food so that was very convenient  First the things that I didnt like were the VERY thin towels that I would expect from a economy motel and not a Hyatt  Also the bathrooms very small and allowed for just one person to get ready at a time  The TV was just an average quot tube TV at this price range I would typically expect a newer LCD   especially for a newly reated property  Breakfast was very pricey so I never bothered to go into the restaurant The good things of the property are again location staff was very nice and helpful  I booked the room through AMEX travel but it showed up in their system as a Travelocity reservation so I would not be eligible for Hyatt points but the person checking me in offered us free internet access for  laptops as compensation so that was good Overall it was an average stay for a Hyatt but I really wish they would upgrade their towels  I would even use their towels for rags at home  
P => Good Service Great Pool We just returned from our trip to Montreal  Montreal is an incredible city and we enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt  We received excellent service from Audrey at the front desk and also a bellman who went out of his way to assist us  The pool at this hotel is a beautiful set up and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at the Hyatt and in Montreal  
P => hyatt hyatt yes the hallways are dark  yes the rooms are even darker not to mention a little florescent  the towels are thin the rooms are cold  its expensive  now that weve gotten that all out of the way    the whole hotel has been recently reated so it feels modern and tidy  the sauna and steam room are gorgeous   extremely clean and relaxing    spa like  the pool despite being filled with children is pleasant as is the the slightly unkempt outside kterrace that wraps around the whole place  buffet breakfast was delicious and the restaurant is attractive  staff was friendly and let us check out at pm though the housekeeper did not seem too happy about that  the location is not thrilling but ultimately extremely convenient  its not a design hotel its not a luxury hotel but its a very good relatively stylish comfortable hotel  
P => Convenient Location but just OK I booked my room one day before check in at priceline  I think they gave us the smallest room in the hotel triangle shaped with one queen bed  The towels were terrible   thin rough the kind you would expect at a motel  Also I tried calling both the concierge and front desk and the phone would just ring and ring  We ran out of toilet paper one day into our stay we stayed a weekend although housekeeping did pick up the phone and bring some up almost immediately  However the location cant be beat  Its right above the Complex Desjardins with tons of shops near museums and restaurants public transportation very accessible  I would say this is probably better suited to a business traveler than a vacationer  This was fine for a quick getaway but if I had booked the room at the regular price I would have been disappointed  
P => Exquisitively comfortable beds Very friendly and helpful staff  At the reception area the lady simply made the comment that my bill was prepaid through Priceline  She took a print on my credit card and left it to it The staff was very polite the bed exquisitively comfortable  The room was clean and the carpet extremely thick and agreable to walk on barefoot  Unfortunately something came up around  oclock in the morning  The fire speaker went off but the sound was very faint  Enough to wake you up and make you wonder whence the noise was coming from    I eventually called up the reception they told me they were aware of the problem and offered some ear plugs  I refused and requested some tape to seal the speaker off  Which they refused  However they agreed for me to watch any movie I would like free of charge and offered me a free night for my next trip in any Hyatt Regency hotel The noise stopped at around am Needless to say beside the fact that the room was indeed very comfortable and the bedding wonderful my night was far from perfect  However they were very correct with me Yes something else    I thought I would be able to sleep late in the morning since checkout is at  oclock but at  somebody from Security knocked at the door until he got me out of bed because he was told to open the bedroom safety box    A mistake    which spoiled my morning fun   Checkout was smooth  As promised no additional charges were made to my card and i now have another free night at a Hyatt  All in all a dreadful night    Due to bad luck only    The hotel is great the swimming pool is a bit small and there are no jacuzzis    none that I could see anyway the staff very nice  I am more than willing to give it another try  
P => Very comfortable and modern The Hyatt was very modern large and clean  The hotel is right downtown and close to downtown shopping underground malls   is situated right over a mall and old Montreal  The Hyatt was priced accordingly with hotels in the area but we got a really great deal through their th night free promotion  One thing to watch out for is parking  They have valet for day where you can remove your car as well as self park for day where you have to repay if you want to move your car  We found out from a Tourist Info Centre that there was cheaper parking in the area and as there was no reason to move our car we should have at least self parked  The room was kept very clean by housekeeping  Staff was all friendly and helpful  They did not have free high speed Internet as most rooms do  Another issue was evening noise on Saturday and Sunday night  We were on the th floor and could hear evening parties going on but they usually ended fairly early  Overall a great hotel 
P => very central We have just returned after our first trip to canada which started in Montreal This was the first hotel we stopped at The hotel was very central with easy access to the highways once you had figured out what streets where one waySt Catherine street was an eye  opener the amount of male strip bars where a little over the top Also the amount of people begging for money made you feel a little weiry   The harbour was within walking distance and once you find it you will spend most evenings there eating its far better The Keg is an exellent eating place down by the harbour  
P =>   stars We stayed here for two nights in ust   The staff is bilingual and the concierage was extremely helpful in giving us directions and arranging a tour  The hotel has recently been refurbished with newer bedding and carpeting but the bathrooms are small The bathtubs were not replaced and were stained  Excellent location and reasonable rates nice bar breakfast buffet was just OK  
P => Excellent location  Stayed for just two nighs at the Hyatt Regency in Montreal but loved every moment of it  The check in staff made us feel really welcome and valued guests even spending time with us to show how to make the most of the  days we had in the city for sight seeing and recommending places to eat and things to see and do  Our room was very clean well appointed and comfortable  Would recommend using the hotels valet parking    dollars a day its good value and far more convenient  The swiming pool is a good size and when youve had enough swimming you can sit out on the roof weather permitting  Overall a very enjoyable stay and will deffinately use again should we return to Montreal  
P => Wow Nice Hotel This was a getaway vacation for one night   we were pleasantly surprised We booked the room through Hotwire and saved about  over the hotel discounted AAA rate  The check in was extremely pleasant as was the room we got on the business floor   VERY comfortable beds cleanneat and quiet The pool area is great   not a huge pool but generously sized  They have life jackets floating toys and other things for kids There is a Dry and wet steam as well as a st class exercise room   the treadmills and ellipticals are top of the line with your own personal tv on it Cant say anything about the restaurants   we didnt eat there   but the lounge near the lobby looked quite tempting for a nightcap All in all we were a little nervous from some of the comments on tripadvisor but dont listen to them   this is definitely a  star hotel The only downside was the   to park your car in the hotel which is attached to Centre Desjardins a indoor malloffice building I would say this hotel is perfect for a couple or a family   and the location is a  minute walk to the action of downtown Thanks 
P => Not one of the Better Hyatts Didnt really like this Hyatt too much  Since I was there for a convention I had the opportunity to check out a few rooms  Although we had non smoking rooms every room smelled like people had been smoking in them Also the hallways were very dark  It gave it a dingy appearance The rooms were nothing special When I got to the hotel it was a bit confusing to figure out where to check in  I asked for a room away from the elevator on the high floor  They gave me the th floor one of the lower ones On a positive note The service was good and so was the location although in Montreal I think most hotels have a good location  The lobby was comfortable and theres a great food court on the lower floors of the building  
P => Great Hotel With a velous Concierge We recently stayed at the Hyatt for  nights and had a wonderful first visit to Montreal  The location is great for almost anything  Beds were extremely comfortable and the housekeeping was spot on Had a bit of a hitch with the internet and was never able to resolve it although we tried and they tried too  The pool and exercise areas were top notch  All employees were super but the concierge was the best  He got us reservations to a great French restaurant and helped book a tour by phone when we were too late to do it online We travel extensively and would give this hotel our highest recommendation  Very good value 
P => Great Accomodations My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal from    We enjoyed the nice comfortable bed cleanliness of the room and friendly staff  We found the concierge and front desk staff very helpful with directions and other assistance The location is within close proximity of many of Montreals attractions The only downside was the parking which was   day  We did not use this parking instead we parked in the adjacent mall parking for  for  hours you must pay again if you leave the lot but with the Hyatt parking you can come and go as you please but at the higher rate for one day and parked across the street on the other days this only works if you are gone during the day during a weekend stay since metered parking is hr  
P => Location We booked our three night stay at the Hyatt Regency Montreal through hotwire com  per night and found it to be more than suitable for our needs  The weather was bitterly cold during our mid il stay but the quotunderground cityquot connects to the Hyatt was a welcome surprise as we could find shelter from the elements visit the petting zoo and grab some inexpensive food  The room was exactly what we were promised and there was no issue whatsoever at check in  We chose the self park option  day as opposed to the valet option day for our car and we only took it out of the heated  parking lot once to see the Biodome outside of the city  The room was spacious and catered to all of our needs normally budget travelers  The bathroom was updated with new tile mirrors recessed sink and magnification mirror along with updated fixtures and lights  Everything was very clean  The room was also updated with trendy bedding and furniture which complimented the bathroom or vice versa  The bedding and pillows were very comfortable The Hyatt is located on the corner of Rue de St  Catherine a prime spot for shopping for anything your heart desires and anything your stomach craves  It is also only blocks from Chinatown and the beautiful architecture museums shops and food of the Old Port  This location was optimal for first time visitors  
P =>   Hotel in Montreal We stayed at the Hyatt for three nights  Staying at the Hyatt was a win win  It was very cold il   but underneath the hotel is a mall with shops and restaurants  Our room was very comfortable with nine pillows on a king size bed and the bed was very comfortable  Very clean room asked for a room on a high floor and we stayed on the th floor great view  This was a bargain booking through priceline  The hotellis in a great location you can walk to everything  Read every review and was nervous to stay but this place is a winner  The indoor pool is quite clean with great views and the exercise room is first class  Its staying at a W without the price 
P => Nothing special but fine We did the sweet deal nd night half off both nights include free breakfast buffet  The hotel itself is nice the room spacious and we had a great view facing the front of the hotel  The bathroom is dark but enough light at the mirror just showering it is very dark  The bed large and extremely comfortable  The gym was more than sufficient and  hours  The pool somewhat small but nice  Overall the staff very friendly  Breakfast buffet nice not a great selection but food was good and there is an omlete station The main reason we got this hotel was for the location  Location was fine it is a little walk to either subway stops via the underground  But chinatown and eaton center well within walking distance  Parking  canadian under the hotel  I found  a night two blocks south near chinatown  So it pays to look around a bit  Overall hotel was fine  I was happy with it and really no complaints  There was nothing that amazed me at all  If you are looking for a place with a nice location and basic things this hotel is fine especially if you can get a good deal on hotwire or something  
P => Great Value for Money I have been to Montreal numerous times and love to try new Hotels as often as possible  This trip was with the boys to see a hockey game and I booked on Priceline for   taxes in US a night We got two rooms for  nights for what any normal  star hotel would have been for  night  After finding out it was the Hyatt and reading the mixed reviews I was a little nervous  I have stayed at Loews Omni Intercontinental and Sheraton in Montreal all very nice with Loews being absolutely sensational Now having said that I would not classify this as a  star it isnt quite as nice as any of the previous mentioned properties in Montreal it is more of a  to   star which it was rated on Priceline be that is what all the mixed reviews are about  Here is my breakdown of the propertyProsHow can you go wrong at the rate offered on PricelineGreat location  min walk underground to Metro IGA food court Baton Rouge Restaurant and numerous stores right underneath in Complex Desjardins Every member on the staff I encountered was very helpful and spoke excellent EnglishNice Beds and no charge fridge and safe in room which was really helpfulNice pool areagymConsTiny bathrooms not sure how everyone is complaining about the lighting the light by the mirror was bright and the bathroom was too small not to be able to see everythingYou have to take a could of elevators to check inget to your roomget down to the underground city a minor issue and one of the elevators sounded like it was on the fritzAnother minor issue but toiletries were not replaced each day I heard from other people I talked to that booked on Hotwire as a  star for about  US a night So if you are going on a weekend I would seriously try using Priceline remember on Priceline it is a   star check Hotwire first and then make your bid about   less  If you can get this hotel for under  a night I promise you wont be disappointed but if you are paying   a night much more in summer of course you  end up wondering if it was worth it  
P => We had a pleasant stay The ProsI booked a long weekend getaway for my boyfriends birthday a couple months in advance  Having read the recent reviews it made me a little nervous that we were booked at the Hyatt  However our stay turned out to be very enjoyable  We stayed in a room with a king bed  The bed was very comfortable and I loved the moutain of pillows they provided nine of them The staff was consistently helpful friendly and courteous the  days we were there  There was a coffeemaker with complimentary coffee and teas in the room  Mugs and glasses were provided  We ordered an in room movie and there was a little technical difficulty that was quickly attended to and they didnt charge us for the movie  We had drinks and desserts at the lobby bar and the staff was professional and the prices were reasonable  They make a mean cosmo We also had the buffet breakfast which was included in the price of our room  It was a little smaller than other hotel breakfast buffets Ive been to but it had all the basics including an eggomelette station  The cafe where the buffet was served was very nice lots of windows overlooking a rooftop terrace which I believe would be gorgeous in the summer  We used their pool and gym which were very good  The pool is quite large   none of those lap pools you see in the newer hotels  There were many attendants around to give you towels and supervise the area  The k area around the pool is elevated with many comfortable lounge chairs  The pool was essentially in a solarium so it was warm bright and perfect for relaxing with a good book which I did  The gym equipment is new and theres a  inch plasma TV in there so youre entertained boyfriend was happy about this  The concierge was excellent and very professional  He got us the restaurant reservations we wanted the movie showtimes for the closest theatre pointed us to the best bagels in town  Location location location  We were smack in the middle of downtown Montreal  Everything was a  min walk or a  min drive bc of all the one way streets you need to make many detours  The hotel was directly connected to the subway and a pretty shopping mall by elevator  There are of restaurants banks grocery stores shops etc  in close vicinity of the hotel  The parking lot was one of the cleanest most well designed lots weve seen  We loved how accessible everything was from our hotel The ConsJust a few minor hiccups that can be improved on and Im really nitpicking here  The water temperature of the shower was sometimes unstable   we found this was especially so during the peak shower times morning and night  It was fine in the afternoon  We asked for a humidifier which was brought to our room after  repeated requests  As mentioned above the breakfast buffet was on the small side and some of the food wasnt as warm as wed like  The TV in the room was a ent size but an older model  We were told by the technician that they soon plan to replace the entire system with a new one though  As for the dark bathrooms I really dont know what people are talking about  While the lights were not extremely bright there was plenty of light in the bathroom  I was able to do my makeup there and see everything clearly  I guess when you close the shower curtain theres less light because theres no lighting on top of the shower but you can definitely still see  The shower curtain however caused some leaking problems if you dont pull it close all the way  We had a few puddles on the ground after our first shower  OverallI have to say Id stay there again especially with the great rate we got  nd night was half price and free breakfast each morning Its a great hotel if you want to actually enjoy the hotel facilities  We noticed that many families stayed there probably for ch Break but the nice thing was you can request for a quiet room like we did and there was not a peep from screaming children or anything at all really  We rented a car but its really not necessary if youre staying at the Hyatt  Its so central and the hotel is in good condition recent reations  I would definitely recommend this hotel in terms of bang for buck  
P => False advertising My husband and I had never been to Montreal so we were looking for something special  Unfortunately I was quite disappointed  This is a Hyatt Regency On the hotel website it described our room which was a King with a View as quot   newly reated room including one king size Grand Bed featuring ultra plush pillows the softest of sheeting and thick down blankets all piled atop an irresistible pillow top mattress  quot That is completely FALSE The view was magnificent but the bed might as well have been a motel  bed  Yes there were a million pillows but the sheets were not soft there was no down blanket and I cant be positive but it didnt seem like a pillow top mattress to me  The bed was a huge let down  Also there was no mini bar which I thought was unusual  And bring your own lighting if you expect to put on makeup ladies  Seriously it was like a cave in the bathroom  Temp location and sound proofing were good and the staff was excellent but all in all it was a let down  
P => Pleasantly Surprised We stayed one night on a quick trip from New Hampshire  We chose the hotel because of its indoor pool we have  children   ages    and the direct connection to the underground and Metro Things we likedConciergefront desk all were very helpful and friendly happy to speak English and offer suggestions for breakfast dinner directions etc Convenenience easy to get to Metro and shops we walked to the Hard Rock Cafe for dinner to Chez Cora for breakfast underground parking was easy to find inexpensive  CA Pool the pool was GREAT for kids and families not a lap pool lots of noodles kick boards toys and even swim vests the attendantlifeguard was attentive with towels and the heat lamps made it feel warm and sunny inside while it was a blizzard outside Rooms we had  adjoining rooms which were spacious updated clean beds were firm with new linens view of the city was great th floor in room safe extra pillow and blanket nice toiletries in bathroom Things to improveLighting prior reviews are right on   the rooms especially the bathrooms are dark No minibar There was no minibar or even bottled water  Also only floors   have vending machines Noise between rooms was well sound proofed but hallway noise travelled easily and loudly thru the doors All in all we were pleasantly surprised by the hotel  It is very much a business hotel but we found it a perfect winter escape with kids who are impressed by hotel pools elevators and riding the subway  
P => Amazing Amazing hotel We had a very very large room with king bed and a hundred pillows Nice bathroom good service excellent location parking and mero station accessible via the hotel lift  Best hotel we stayed in Montreal 
P => Very Nice Beautiful hotel service lovely rooms overall great place and plenty of stores and eateries right downstairs  
P => Perfect Location   Nice hotel Couldnt ask for a better stay  Large comfortable bed  Clean room with hot shower  Consierge made reservations for us at a bistro which was family friendly with a  month old and was perfect for what we wanted  Movie selection is outstanding  Location is perfect   at start of St Catherine St Laurent and close to OId Town  Booked on Priceline and got a great price  
P => Nice Hotel in a Great City Pros Clean and attractive hotel nice rooms great location on Saint Catherine Street undergound access to Metro theatre district and food court easy access via bus to Dorval Airport security box great deal with PricelineCons Walking east of the hotel along Saint Catherine Street is shady at night  
P =>  day stay at hyatt We stayed at the Hyatt for  nights  We arrived very early from our flight and they were able to check us in early  However the room they put us in hadnt been cleaned yet  They were very accomodating and immediatley moved us to a clean room  The room was comfortable with a king size bed and a workstation desk  The bed was comfortable too The hotel is very centraly located for seeing the tourist sights  It is also has a mall downstairs with access to the metro underground  We had breakfast and lunch at Cafe Republic which is only a block from the hotel  It was great food and good service  We also ate at the food court in the mall and picked up some snacks at the IGA downstairs The underground city is really nice especially if it is poor weather  We used it alot since the weather was very rainy when we were there  The hotel conceirge is helpful although she reccomended a restaraunt that was closed we wandered around for quite a while to find it and then discovered it was closed  The lobby is very modern and updated  The rooms have been updated it is pretty clear they were partially reated  We got really great room rates on priceline com so we were pretty happy with the stay  However if I had paid full price I would have been disappointed  
P => Good location trumped by poor business services I stayed at this hotel for a week during a convention held at the Montreal Convention Center Palais de Congres First the positives  The hotel was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly  It is located on top of a shopping mall and there is a food court directly beneath the hotel so you can get eats at all prices  I had the hotel breakfast once tasty by expensive and then opted for the myriad of choices in the mall for the rest of my trip  The hotel is only a few blocks away from the convention center which was key for me  If you werent particular about this point the idealness of the venue drops a lot The negatives   as mentioned in other reviews the bathrooms have HORRIBLE lighting  It is dark and completely insufficient  Im not sure if its meant to be romantic or what but for a business traveller who needs to look her best its quite unacceptable  And while we are on the subject of business travellers not only was the internet access expensive it didnt actually work  I followed the instructions given to me by the front desk and the instructions listed in the room and each time I tried to log in and pay I was given an error message and asked to call some central  tech support number  There were a lot of other convention goers I spoke to who had the same complaint  Really for a hotel who is playing host to major business events this is really shoddy I actually was so frustrated by my experience that I left feedback on the quotcomment cardquot they leave in your room  I did receive a nice email a few months later addressing my concerns to some extent  Apparently they will be reating the bathrooms Negativity aside Montreal is an amazing city  I was lucky enough to have a good friend who is a native and we spent every night seeing a different side of the place going to a different restaurant etc  I think if I were to return and especially if I was paying the bill not the company Id choose a different hotel than the Hyatt  
P => Great Hotel and great location Montreal Hyatt RegencyDate ober  Reviewer A Hyatt Vacation Club MemberJust returned from a  day stay  This the first time we have stayed at a Hyatt hotel  The Regency is a business class hotel in the middle of the business district  It is very close to shopping theatres and museums as well  The staff was very professional helpful and very friendly The hotel is right above one of Montreals underground shopping areas  It is only a  minute walk to the Montreal Metro and this can be reached underground as well  There is also a bus stop outside the hotel  There is an elevator in the hotel that goes from the foyer to the shopping areametro and to the parking garage  Since it is a business hotel the breakfast buffet is   CADperson and lunch buffet is around  CADperson  There is a food court in the underground shopping area so we never used the dining room  We were able to save money on food by eating breakfast and sometimes lunch at the food court  There are a couple moderately priced restaurants outside the hotel as well  The hotel has a very nice lounge as well We were on one of the top floors and had no problem with street noise  There were convention meetingsgroups at the hotel but never heard them  The rooms were spacious and the or didnt bother us  I was surprised by the bathroom didnt have enough counter space  There was a small refrigerator in the room but no microwave oven  Parking at the adjoining public parking garage was  CADday  Valet parking at the hotel is  CAD The hotel is very nice and modern  The view wasnt the best due to skyscrapers but we were able to see the towers of the Notre Dame Basilica located in the historic part of town  With the Metro so close it is very convenient to all tourist sites  I with all the conveniences close by I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => OK But We recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal and here is the feedback The hotel is ok but I doubt if we would ever go back there mainly because of the drab depressing and horrendous or  The corridors were a mixture of off grey and sludge brown  The rooms were the same awful colours but were at least modern   but the bathroom was hideous  A cramped room in the same dismal colours with one tiny pathetic dim lamp that barely lit the mirror The rest of the bathroom was in the dark and no the lamps werent broken   there was only one  Unfortunately our view was of a grafitti painted car park cant blame the hotel for that I suppose Having been to Montreal I know now that personally I would have preferred to stay somewhere in the old quarter  A lot more going on more restaurants a more relaxed location  
P => Noisy The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything   and I mean everything Kids were screaming late at night and the cleaning staff was vacuuming at am  People were taking showers at am  There is no sound insulation or any sound proofing whatsoever between the walls floors and doors  We heard the people walking above us  This is not a quiet hotel for a good nights sleep  The hotel does have an excellent location and does enforce its non smoking policy in its non smoking rooms with a  fine which is great  The sheets and towels have a strong bleach odor and my wash cloth had holes in it  There were several dirty dishes left out in the hallway from people who had ordered room service  Also housekeeping doesnt clean very well behind the toilet We could hear the activity from Ste Catherine street on our high floor Claud at the front desk was kind enough to secure our luggage at am for our pm check in  He gave us  rooms on a high floor with a superb view of Place des Arts The conceirge let us check our e mail for free at the Regency Club for  minutes The rooms are modern and updated however they felt sterile like a hospital room The hotel prefers  hour notice to call the return shuttle bus aero bus to the airport The staff was excellent however this is not the hotel if you like quiet  
P => Great location and Service at Hyatt Montreal Great location   walk to great restaurantsclubs of St Denis amp Plateau downtown core historical Old Montreal McGill U  and is by Metro for anywhere else  Mall below convenient for quotbreakfastquot and Budget rental too Great service   baggage concierge reception extremely helpful in locating quotBell Storequot   he made over  calls for us Nice room with a vieweven on quotsecondquot floor really the th  comfy beds and great maid service too  Lovely pool  with a large glass roof  only complaint is minor  no hottub Made for a truly wonderful and memorable quotMontreal experiencequot   Loved it and will be back 
P => Loved the Hyatt We spent Labor Day weekend at the Hyatt with our  month old baby  The rooms are large and clean it is clear that the hotel has been reated  The location is great and the staff was OK  We asked for a crib every night but received it only on the last night  We booked our room through Price Line and got an awesome deal which made our stay even better  
P => Nice but the bathroom really is dark For US  Hotwire it was a good deal especially for a Tuesday night and is within walking distance to Old Montreal where we  stay next time  The bathroom has only two small halogen ceiling lights one each above the mirror and the toilet so the shower is dark and it was difficult for me to shave and for my wife to put on makeup  Why cant they all make bathrooms like La Quinta with lots of room and light Overall we would recommend the Hyatt though with its modern and nice furnishing  They give you a cube fridge to store your own stuff and a one cup coffee maker  We did not have problems navigating the dual elevator system that probably keeps street people from wandering into the hotel  Parking is not cheap at CNnight self park and CN valet but this is typical in nice downtown hotels  Check in amp out was painless and the staff were pleasant  Buy your coffee outside for the lobby bar charged me CN  for a medium sized cup of quotCharbucksquot on my way out ouch Lastly the nice concierge fellow sent us to Eggspectation a Canadian chain for a late breakfast in Old Montreal  We would have preferred being sent to one of the neat looking small bistros we saw later when walking around but it was okay  It is like a classier combination of LePeep and Le Madeleine restaurants  Our entrees eggs Benedict amp crepes were good but their quotBunnquot coffee was institutional tasting bleh PS When I got a BK hamburger while waiting for our return flight at the Montreal airport I could empathize with Bruce Willis character Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski who said that he would kill the next person who put o on his hamburger in Canada    
P => Great Hyatt but wireless internet access a hassle for me This is a typical well run Hyatt  Overall my two night stay was very enjoyable   I have an older wireless laptop using the quotbquot standard wireless card the slowest and least advanced  Even most of the cheapest laptops sold today have moved to the next wireless level the quotgquot standard while the higher quotaquot standard  be found on premium laptops  When I told the desk I was having problems connecting and staying connected to the net I was advised to call tech support  I was getting either lower signal strength or no signal strength  Tech support told me to go to the desk and borrow an adaptor kit  I did so and the kit came wo instructions so I plugged it in both as an antenna and a power supply  This didnt help  Curious as to whether my laptop had been damaged since I last used it I asked the concierge if there were any free wireless cafes in town  He didnt think so  However walking around I found a couple and found my older wireless laptop worked great in them wo an adaptor  I returned to my room and discovered by accident that if I just plugged the adaptor into the laptop but not into a power source the adaptor made my laptop work perfectly   The hotel removed the internet access charge from bill for my trouble   I have had wireless internet hassles in some hotels but not others the class or price of the hotel does not seem to be a factor in hassles or no hassles   Wired internet access is certainly a nice amenity especially as hotels staffs seemed untrained in wireless access problems  
P => Great Location Wonderful Room The Hyatt was a wonderful experience  Its location was perfect  We were able to walk everywhere  minutes to Vieux Montreal  minutes to Rue Crescent  The hotel is also connected to the Underground City and the Metro is only a block away  We were able to book our room on Priceline for night  The room was very clean and the bed was very soft and luxurious  The concierge was very helpful and was willing to provide maps of Montreal  The indoor pool is great and is connected to an outdoor sunk  Everyone speaks both French and English very well  The Hyatt made our stay very enjoyable   you will not be disappointed  
P => Great Location Spent two days in Montreal in y with my wife and three kids   Hyatt is located just a couple of blocks from old Montreal and above an underground mall  You can take the elevator from the Hyatt lobby to the mall food court and shopping  Mall also had a superket and wine shop  Kids loved the indoor swimming pool  Bathroom was dark but the room was very clean and well orated  Staff was very helpful and friendly  We will return to the Hyatt  
P => Excellent Reated  Star The Hyatt Montreal has just recently been reated and it shows  The room or is very nice and definitely above average compared to other chain  star hotels in North America  The bathroom is of particular note with a deep Kohler sink black ble counter ble flooring and very large mirror  The room came with a large ish quot Philips TV  two line telephones wet bar area though no minibar computer desk area and a very comfortable king size bed  The or was very modern with no fewer than  multiple setting ultra modern light fixtures contemporary bedspread including multiple cushions brand new carpeting ergonomic desk chair and a door that let in not a single crack of light  The bathroom amenities provided were definitely above standard and of boutique grade with a pleasant lavender citrus scent as opposed to the cheap chemical scented stuff that one usually gets  The in room wireless high speed internet worked wonderfully though there was a day charge The public areas of the hotel are also above average and reflective of a complete overhaul  The public bathrooms include very nice water fountains and private stalls with walls and doors that go all the way down  The bar restaurant and lobby are all ultra modern and befit a boutique hotel as opposed to the standard impersonal s or which is usual at most big concrete business hotels  Service was very good with a bellman taking my luggage upon arrival by cab at the door and bringing them up to my room soon after check in  Hyatts new quotPerfect Stayquot program with a one stop conciergeproblem solving number was much appreciated too and demonstrated to me a commitment to service above and beyond the Sheratons and Deltas Im used to staying at The location is great just across the street from Place des Arts and within a  minute walking distance of the commercial heart of downtown Montreal and McGill University  The hotel is located within a large commercial skyscraper complex which includes  office towers and a very large food court and shopping centre  There is also a grocery store within the shopping centre which is a major convenience for cheap food The only concerns I had were very minor ones namely the lack of  hour room service and a minibar in the room  While I do not use these services frequently I do appreciate having the use of a fridge to store cool drinks in my room and would understand a late travellers desire to use a post pm room service  Overall I was impressed by this Hyatt and believe it meets the new st century standards in business class hotels  Why stay at an unreated impersonal concrete block with mediocre service when you could stay here 
P => Hyatt in Montreal   a nice place with some problems Stayed at this property recently   this was my rd stay in the past  years the first occurred when this hotel was under the Wyndham flag  The difference is barely noticeable Overall this hotel is quite good for a downtown Montreal property  However it is and has been consistently a  star property rather than a  star property which is low for a travellers expectations of a Hyatt The rooms were nicely orated with a modern look  Furnishings and carpet were generally good  We had a th floor room which was an upgrade to the Regency Club   the only noticeable difference was the furnishings which had a more sophisticated look The Positives  Desk staff are friendly and helpful  Pool and outdoor terrace are very nice and well kept including gardens  Pool is staffed by a trained lifeguard  Overall appearance of the hotel is clean and polished  Beds are comfortableThe Negatives  Lack of a fitted sheet on the bed as others noted  Elevators to the hotel from the street level are slow  Restaurant is expensive and ordinary breakfast buffet is basic and overpriced  In room coffee set provided for  cup packet only they willingly brought more when asked  Ceilings in room entrance and bathroom showed signs of wear  Water pressure in tub was only adequate and whiny  Windows were dirty as others noted  AC was difficult to operate as others notedOverall I would stay there again but might also give others a try to improve on some of the finer touches  
P => Will come again We booked  rooms through Priceline and contacted the hotel right away to request for king size beds and non smoking rooms  The costumer representative were very friendly and helpful  They answered my e mail promptly and we got what we requested for Con   as everyone here said to figure out how to get to the lobby of the hotel is quite confusing since you have to use  elevator to the room  elevator to the street and another elevator to the underground city    Dark Room and even darker bathroom  Period   No Jacuzzi with the swimming pool Pro  Despite the problematic lighting the room itself is comfortable and spacious    I LOVE the bathroom assortments The color and fragrance of the shampoo conditioner and soaps are SO delightful that I took all the leftover home    The swimming pool area is quite nice even though they dont have Jacuzzi  The balcony connected to the swimming pool became the best front row seat for the outdoor concert at Jazz fest   Location location and location  Yes I will absolutely stay here again  
P => very pleased This hotel is improved over the Wyndham previous name when I last stayed there a few years ago  I booked through Expedia  At check in they warned me that music from the Jazzfest would go until  at night and could be heard from my room  Then they honored my request to have a room away from the sound  I did travel for Jazzfest but prefer not to hear the music from my room  The room had a refrigerator a welcome surprise since I like to buy fruit and wine  Comfortable above average furnishings  Sheets that wouldnt stay tucked in were the only negative  Elevator arrangement is confusing but you figure it out  Concierge friendly and helpful  The location is ideal for activities around the Place des Arts  
P => friendly stay in MOntreal We just got back from Quebec and we loved our stay at the Hyatt Montreal I dont get all the complaints  yes we did stay on the VIP floors so be the lower floors get a bum deal     but Lighting       Bathroom is fine       i dont want  watts when i first wake up    granted  the front entry light to the rooms should be brighter  but they are going for the Chic comfy look     it could be on a dimmer Second location   cant be beet        yes  the area behind the hotel is a little seedy with its gay clubs sex stores    and asian restaurants  but this is a huge city      and probably safer than most US cities It is so close to downtown  and Old Montreal is  blocks away  perfect for exploring  Staff could not have been more cheerful   especially when we checked in  quite busy   always a bon jour and a smile      all thougout our stay  Food was quite good  Utilze the VIP section if you are that lucky   the desserts and appetizers hit the spot after a long hot day of playing tourists  Only complaint    like most  is the elevators     the only way out of this hotel are the  elevators on the lobby floor Four Floors UP God forbid if there was a fire    All in all we thought it was safe quiet  with the Jazz Festival right there  VERY CLEAN and the pool roofk gardens very relaxing Now if only the American Dollar went farther    it would have been Great  
P => Hyatt   great location the bathroom is like a dark cavern Stayed at the Hyatt for Grand Prix weekend so the price for the room was outrageous but that is to be expected  However for what the room is I would hazard to say that the regular price would be overpriced as well So here are the good pointsLocation it is right on Ste  Catherine street  Very walkable to shopping metro is right across the street and very close to old Montr al  Ate in old montreal a couple of nights highly recommend restaurant called Bonaparte   excellent french food excellent service and very reasonable prices with still an upscale atmosphere  Also  min walk to Eggspectations in old Montr al   cut through Place des Armes   always good breakfast  There is also a mall underneath with an IGA   great to grab wine or a snack or sandwich to take to the race track Service he bellman the valet and the concierge were very helpful and friendly  The pool and k   where else can you sun yourself on a rooftop in downtown Montr alThe bad pointsThe room   I am not sure what the person was thinking who designed the bathroom but there was one light  It was so dark I could barely see myself in the mirror perhaps this is just in the lower floors   we were on the rdThe housekeeping   a couple of times they left quotclean  towels that were anything but   totally grossThe room amenities   TV is old and it seems like there once was a mini fridge but was subsequently removed BTW   if you are thinking about heading to Baton Rouge for dinner or lunch which is right beside the hotel   think twice  Had horrible service there   which I admit is out of character for the chain restaurant 
P => Convenient location I booked an airhotel package with Travelocity and stayed on the th floor in a Regency Club king room  All in all I was pretty happy with the hotel  The ongoing construction is a bit of a nighte though it was mostly confined to the floors below the hotel where the conference rooms are  At the time we were there it wasnt noisy but there was a lot of work going on on the staircases which made getting around underground somewhat of a challenge   The Regency Club itself was a nice oasis with access to free computers printer full breakfast buffet afternoon drinks etc  The hotel is centally located and although the immediate area is not the most thrilling part of Montreal it was nice to be within walking distance of a lot of the key sights  it is also located right on top of a mall with a large food court and ent shopping so you dont have to eat at the hotel if you dont want to  The hotel is not too large which made getting around relatively easy  The room was comfortable service ent and I had no trouble with the internet access which is also free with a regency club room  I would stay here again  
P => The good the bad and the ugly I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal for a conference in e  three nights in a Regency Club King on the th floor The Good  Great bed with soft sheets a duvet and a pillow top mattress  A full length mirror a robe and a refrigerator empty  Quiet despite music festival next to hotel  Large inviting public areas  Attached to a mall with a large food court good to avoid expensivehotel food  Two recessed ceiling lights in the bath so plenty of lightThe Bad  No fitted sheet this seems especially inexcusable since the property has gone to a Green program where linens get changed every three days   Air conditioning seemed to work only the first night after that it blew out humid stale air  Tub was small old and grimy  Towels were small and scratchy  Room was generally dark especially in foyer and in armoire closet  Regency Club lounge was not on one of the club floors but down on the main level next to the restaurant  Inconvenient to say the least   Regency Club staff and concierge were unfriendly and judgemental  Conference room set up is maddening rooms across three floors accessed by only three elevators and these elevators are in addition to the three guest room elevators and the two elevators that take you from ground level to reception  the lack of signage made it worse  No in room safe meaning I had to take any valuables with me at all timesThe Ugly  Stairs and escalators for conference room floors under construction so exposed pipes wires and other unpleasant stuff not to mention need to cram into those three elevators to go up and down only one floor  Restaurant food not appealing and overpriced no menu for breakfast or lunch only a buffet  The location  be convenient but it is not a nice part of town   lots of construction orange cones dust and noise nearbyConclusion Very much a three star property and not worth the  Canadian a night  It might be a good deal for half of that  Be forewarned  
P => Class act Having paid a nightly rate of  from hotwire we were not sure what to expect  The hotel surpassed all  We had called ahead to request a nonsmoking king upper level away from elevator and were told that everything would be done to accommadate this request  Staff at the front desk were friendly helpful  The valet was working  jobs and brought our luggage up without missing a beat friendly apolgetic that they took a few minutes The room was beautiful quiet huge and quite a distance from the elevator as we requested king and non smoking  Very quiet peaceful restoring The bed linens bathroom shower and amenties were wonderful  Top notch and luxury level  No Bathrobe  but I give that up for quiet clean and comfortable Recommendations Gourmand Belge for lunch and patissiere  Le Cube   the St  Paul Hotel is incredible for an expensive but memoriable meal  The Bar   the Hyatt is comfortable and the Tokay Pinot Gris by the glass is wonderful 
P => Modern fortress for conventioneers and arts  Ideal location adjacent to the modern art museum and performing arts center lively Chinatown charming Old Town same atmosphere as old Paris but sans dog poop and smell of urine and direct underground passageway to the Convention Center  Rooms are tastefully and comfortably furnished though gloomy brown on beige palette and smallish window with view of the shopping mall rooftop and neighboring skyscraper facade lends a dim and charmless feeling  I spent  nights on a business trip and I must admit it felt homier toward the end  Disappointments for this class of hotel I expected a bathrobe  Light in the entry hall is so dim that its hard to discern your clothes in the closet  Bathroom has just one bare spotlight over the sink   votive candles or even a flashlight for the bathtub would be a welcome touch  Broadband computer access did not work despite considerable time with the broadband providers help desk  Delights The staff is knowledgeable welcoming and responsive  The gym is spacious and well equipped and the indoor pool and outdoor sunk looked nice though they were closed for remodeling while I was there  The surrounding neighborhood is a bit funky and honky tonk for a couple of blocks but I never felt unsafe due to lively sidewalk traffic  Hint   Take a cab from the airport not the hotel bus  The bus ride is very long stopping at several other hotels and requiring a transfer at the bus terminal and then making several more stops before the Hyatt  Taxi fare is under  Canadian and worth it Hint   There is wonderful super ket in the hotelshopping complex  Stock up on breakfast staples and keep them in the room refrigerator   healthier and cheaper than room service  
P => No Bar No Restaurant Also stayed at the Hyatt over Easter Week and found the rooms to be nicely reated although our room was located at the end of a LONG circular hallway that got a little old as the trip progressed  Im surprised no other reviewers have mentioned the fact that the hotel bar and restaurant are closed for reations which explains why the rates are so good  There is a barrestaurant in the mall below the hotel but if you want a quick quiet cocktail after a long day   it was not the place Also the pool was great and enormous although only  people are allowed in the entire area so the attendant locked the door Sat  afternoon even though only a few kids were using the pool  Id like to read reviews from the families I saw pressing their noses against the glass with screaching  yr olds 
P => Best Location in Montreal Stayed at the Hyatt from il    il   for just  per night thanks to BiddingForTravel  We drove from Michigan nearly  hours each way on the  to our favorite city of Montreal  Gas prices were incredibly high and we should have flown  Last year we flew from Detroit to Montreal on Northwest Airlines for  roundtrip per person The Hyatt has the BEST location in the entire city  We were fortunate enough to spend almost a week during Spring Break this year with fabulous weather  The hotel had many teenagers and young couples with children during our stay which we didnt mind  Whatever is lacking at the Hyatt it will most certainly make up with its location  We were within walking distance to Old Montreal Mont Royal  the Gay Village China Town and all the great clubs and fine restaraunts on Crescent street and St  Denis  Ste Catherine street is at your footsteeps and the subwaymetro is basically connected to the hotel so you barely even have to go outside  I believe the train and the bus station are just a short distance away as well     has some great senior discounts if you want to take the train  The airport is a short  minute ride and you can get an awesome roundtrip deal on the airport shuttle for around   roundtrip per person Compare that to a taxi cab of  one way plus tip however a taxi  be more economical for groups of  people or more If youre planning on driving and then using the public mass transportaion during your stay and not your car do NOT park at Complex Des Jardins  They charge an insane  per day This is the SAME complex that the Hyatt Valet staff will use to park your car  Complex Des Jardins charges  when you park on quotweekend nightsquot however you must arrive and leave within a certain time frame and you cant stay  hours for the  The Hyatt valet charges around  per day plus tip to park at the same location Complex Des Jardins If youre like me and you dont like anyone in your car we recommend you park across the street at the Place Des Arts building same building the metro is located for only  per day Canadian    for a full  hoursIf I had to complain about anything  I would have to say that the shower pressure was very weak compared to our Detroit city water  It was hard to wash off all that cigar smoke from the clubs with the weak water pressure but I guess most people wouldnt complain  The air conditioning didnt cool our room as well as it did last year  We had the AC set at the lowest level for several days and it just wouldnt get below a certain temperature   The hallways can be noisy since there is no quotsound proofingquot between the door and the hallway  You can also hear people walking in the above unit which made it hard to sleep since they were up at all hours of the night The housekeeping staff is excellent  They obeyed our quotdo not disturb sign quot In theory we could have been quotleft alonequot all week if we wanted to  The front desk staff and conceirge were also great  Make sure you ask the conceirge for a free tourist map of Montreal  The clientelle at the Hyatt always seem to be quothigh endquot which we enjoyed We had a high floor away from the elevator vending machines and ice machines  We also requested and received a king bed non smoking room with a terrific view  We had free coffee a large television fridge internet access and excellent soaps lemon lime and toiletries however there was no safe or mini bar  The window was dirty and needed to be washed  Montreal is inundated with an overflow of homeless people which will quickly make you ignore anyone who says quotexcuse me Sirquot on the streets We did hear an annoying quotbangingquot sound at night which sounded either like construction across the street or something banging against the building  It was certainly annoying  Our favorite restaurant which we highly recommend is the quotJardin Nelsonquot located in Old Montreal at Place de Nelson  They have the best strawberry daquiris in the universe and excellent french seafood dishes at reasonable prices all in an outdoor setting with street performers Incredibly romantic location There is a  hour Burger King and a Cafe Depot near the hotel which we recommend you avoid  You  also want to avoid quotSte Viateur bagel and cafequot in Mont Royal There is a wonderful quotcurrency exchangequot on Ste Catheroine street located just one minute from the hotel in a jewelry store  They only charge  to change your money back from Canadian to USA at an excellent exchange rate  Make sure you use the ATM at Bank of Montreal which didnt charge us an ATM fee We recommend you get the quot dayquot or the quotweeklyquot subwaymetro pass which will give you unlimited use of all the metro lines AND the bus line as well  The bus is convenient when the metro closes at amCheck in and check out was a breeze  They just said our room was quotpre paidquot and asked for a credit card for incidentals when we checked in  They also made us sign a sheet of paper which I think stated that we were responsible for incidentals The bottom line is we got another incredible deal at the Hyatt and we would love to stay at this hotel again  Its not home but one of the better hotels we have stayed at  The entire hotel recently received a multi million dollar reation which is featured on Hyatts website  Our room looked exactly liked the photos on the website  Our room was beautiful with excellent or  Keep in mind that the bed is super soft so if you prefer a quotrock hardquot firm mattress you might be disappointed  Also as others have mentioned the bathroom lightning is dim The good news is that on e st all of Montreal will be   smoke free  
P => Mostly bad experience I stayed at the Hyatt for a week and I have to say it was a mostly negative experience  The good Location  You are above a mallunderground walkways that can take you to the conference center and many other locations  You can easily walk to old Montreal  Theres a grocery store and food court in the mall thats right downstairs well two elevators away  Water pressure  You cant see yourself in the dark washroom but the hot water has lots of pressure  Soaps when you get them are not bad quality   not the best but certainly usable  The bad Housekeeping  They dont refill empty shampoo conditioner etc etc  I am staying here a week and went a couple days without roomservice and only took down the quotdo not disturbquot sign when I needed refills as Im in and out of the room for a conference  So Im completely out of shampoo and the bottles are left empty in an obvious place   and they dont refill anything  I had to call for refills  They also dont replace toilet rolls or the teacoffee in your room  As Im paying  per night bit annoyed not having teacoffee in the morning    I phoned and an hour later someone arrived with some items  Also the fitted sheet issue others mention here    so true  I cannot believe that they use a flat sheet on the beds  Woken up every morning on a bare mattress   ew  Other things were tidied up at least   Room Service  Costly room service menu limited hours  I guess Im used to the Hilton thats open really late the only reason I order room service is when I need to eat odd hours due to conventions  But the price   huge price tag on the food and then they tack on  service fee and taxes on top  Also service was LATE both times    they said they would bring my food at a certain time and were late by at least  minutes each time  Not bad but when youre on a schedule for meetings it can throw things off ALSO   they advertise quotfreshly squeezed orange juicequot on the menu at  which is worse than Tropicana  Its seriously generic brand concentrate grade  Stay away or set your expectations low Other than that the people who brought the food were friendly  Elevators  They were out of service at times which meant long waits  Oddly laid out too   a arate elevator takes you up from street level to the lobby  A different elevator takes you up to the rooms  A third elevator takes you down to the mall  More inconvienent is that the stairs seem to be for emergencies only  I am on the first floor above the lobby   so Ive had to take the elevator just to go down a single floor before getting on a second eleavator to go anywhere else  Very annoying   Bathrooms   The lighting  Not bad if youre there for a night   but a whole week it gets on your nerves  One small light over the mirror  Oddly placed so its awkward to put your make up on awkward in that you get shadows all over your face and cannot see  Thats a minor inconvienience  Its the fact that its completely dark everywhere else in the bathroom  I guess this helps hide any grime anywhere else     No full length mirror no safe and naturally no fridge  No mirror is annoying on a business trip for sure  Attending a professional workshop and conference you want to make sure you look presentable   but its pretty difficult as there are no full legnth mirrors anywhere to be found in the room or halls etc  A safe is a big one for me though   for business I have all kinds of gadgets with me I want to lock up when not in the room all day  Every other hotel Ive been in over the past few years has had in room safes   not here First time Ive felt the need to search out a review site to vent  I cant see returning here ever looks like some nice smaller hotels in old montreal   think Id consider something like that next time and dont think Id go to another Hyatt without some research beforehand  
P => Good location good rooms terrible lighting We stayed at the Hyatt for  nights over Easter   The location is great easy access to Metro near Chinatown walking distance to Old Montreal   The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful although the concierge rarely answers the phone  The front desk staff is very professional and pleasant  the breakfast buffet is very good but exactly the same every day so a bit tedious  Service was always chearful  The rooms are well furnished the beds were very comfortable but the lighting is terrible   terrible  Entrance to the hotel can be quite annoying as you have to take an elevator up to the lobby and another elevator up to your room In general the hotel lacks charm but the staff does a good job in making it as personal as possible  Montreal is great lots of good restaurants and cafes  Great kids science museum  Fun city to explore with different areas and lots to see  Oh dont bother to go to the biodomeOlympic park its a waste of time amp money  
P => A good choice I found very little to complain about  Check in was cordial  My request for breakfast vouchers due to my status with Hyatts frequent guest programme was accomodated and I received my welcome amenity wine and cheese shortly after check in The room was certainly not large but it was very comfortable and the furnishings and or of good quality and to my taste  Everything was clean and in good repair  Hyatt has refurbished the rooms since taking over the property from Wyndham That being said I found the one area that could use some improvement was the bathroom  It was quite small     theres no room for improvement there but the fixtures were quite dated and the tile and grout around the bath could have used some attention  The toilet lid had a missing hinge cover that revealed a grungy looking bolt  The hairdryer was of the wall mounted type with a vacuum cleaner hose and was anemic at best  The vanity was moulded composite acrylic     most better hotels now use composite stone The location of the hotel is near boul  St  Laurent which has been the historical and geographical dividing line between east francophone and west anglophone areas of Montreal  The hotel is actually attached to an indoor shopping mall Complexe Desjardins and from there you can take indoor passageways to reach Place des Arts andor the M tro  This is a great plus during the citys cold winter  You can access Montr als quotunderground cityquot and take advantage of many different shopping cultural dining and entertainment options without ever having to don winter apparel  Not many hotels are that well connected All in all I liked the hotel its location and staff and would certainly have no problem staying here again  
P => Hyatt Montreal Alright but wed pick somewhere else The bathroom had one tiny light above the sink area no other lighting in rest of the bathroom so if you take a bath or shower you are almost in the dark  There was some black molding around shower area  Otherwise nice or of the room  In our room there was no mini bar but perhaps some other rooms have them  We were put on the first floor of the actual hotel which is I believe the  or th floor of the building  You can go down to the shopping mall below the hotel for breakfast muffinscoffee to save some additional money  The parking was pretty high with no in out privelidges so when we left   hrs after checking in to go eat some montreal smoked meat across town it was  to leave garage and then the next morning when we left an additional   So perhaps the better deal is the valet price overnight price of  with in out privileges  The pool had nice touch with heated lights above lounge chairs to keep warm after getting out of the pool  Really nice patio furniture around the pool also  The changerooms for the pool were down this dreary looking area off the pool  The attendant was always there to watch and answer questions  Overall we ided wed probably choose another hotel next time  
P => Perfect I went to a wedding at the Hyatt Regency hotel and the event was so perfect  The room was comfy modern and I had a great service   My fiance and I are seriously thinking to do our wedding reception there 
P => Try seeing yourself in the bathroomat the Hyatt Regency I always think that a hotel with internet and high speed elevators should have adequate ambient light in the bathrooms  A single recessed halogen bulb in the ceiling above the sink just doesnt cut it although it sure cuts down on the electricity consumption Dingy is the word which comes to mind Come to think of it the closet didnt have a light either  
P => everything great great location  if the weather is bad you can spend the day in the mall where the mall is located  good variety of food in the food court good shops can ride the subway from the mall to other places   subway system easy to navigate even though I dont speak any French  The Hyatt  rooms large beautifully orated great view of downtown nice bathroom bathrooms are important to me  Staff was really nice  Loved the workout room  nice eqipment  
P => Hotel Is Sweet This is the third time I stayed at the Hyatt Montreal and must say that each time I enjoy it  The tasteful or combined with an attentive courteous staff has made my stays at the hyatt very good  The rooms are spacious and the views that I got were great  I definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone got a great price off hotwire so anyone should try using that site for this hotel  Gluck 
P => Not what i expected of a Hyatt Regency If you like a small dark room and a hotel with no charm or character there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Hyatt in Montreal I opted for a superior room with a view that a booked directly with the hotel and was vastly disappointed tiny windows and low ceilings  Everything seemed minimal as in cheap  Fortunately they allowed me to change hotels the next day and i moved to hotel Nelligan which is pretty comfy though I have to say they could use better lighting in room  but the hotel is great    very nice ambiance   all the modern conveniences at your fingertips in a homey friendly atmoshphere  
P => Really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Stayed at the Hyatt Montreal two weeks ago  Very very nice  Purchased the room via hotwire for about  bucks and I believe it was considered a  star  The or was very stylish our room was so nice and clean  I loved the pillows and the comforter on the bed was beautiful and the bathroom was granite and just so modern  The staff was very nice and helpful  The location was great we were about  walking blocks from Maison du Jazz a super cool jazz club that comes highly recommended as well  My husband and I would definitely go back to the Hyatt  Thumbs up 
P => Hyatt Regency Montreal   Loved it Just returned from a  night stay      in room  and loved it From Dorval Airport I took the Aerobus to the bus terminal near the Berri Metro station for C taxi is C directly to the hotel a better deal if youre not traveling alone  From the bus terminal there was a free mini bus to the Hyatt  Although the mini bus was difficult to find all personel were helpful and friendly  On the return trip to Dorval I walked to the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel to catch the bus directly to airport  Much easier if you dont mind the  block walk Check in at the hotel was quick smooth and very friendly  In other bulletin boards I had read warnings of attempts by desk personel offering to upgrade accommodations to Regency Club for additional payment  There were reports of misunderstandings of per night and per stay amounts  Nothing was offered when I checked in My room was nicely appointed and the bed very comfortable  Plenty of towels coffee maker and clear indications of additional charges for internet and phone  Plenty of lighting in the room but the bathroom had one small halogen type light above the sink and was VERY dark  This room would have been a problem for someone applying makeup The concierge was helpful in giving me directions for using the metro subway and provided maps and helpful advice  Actually this was the case in every situation with locals  Montreal is a truely sophisticated and friendly city Didnt use the pool or fitness center but it seemed to be popular and busy when I passed by The Hyatt is part of a shopping and restaurant complex that has an informal food court for quick meals  The other hotel and on street restaurants in the immediate area were busy the entire holiday weekend Check out was effecient and friendly  
P => Cannot fault anything at the Hyatt great reations as well I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal at the end of y  as it was the best rate we could get in a   hotel in downtown Montreal during this busy time both the Francofolies going on in front of the hotel and Divers Cit  in the village  For the price we paid the hotel was perfect The last time I stayed at this location was back in  when it was still a Wyndham and the public areas havent changed much since  Back then Wyndham had just redone everything as the previous occupants the Le Meridien chain had left it in a sad shape  So lobbybar area are the same as theyve been in the last  years except that the carpets and some furniture were changed  I liked the style they had before in the lobby so Im glad they didnt really change it but the new furniture is very sleek and modern  You wont find yourself in a flower power style riott here  LOCATION Depending on what youre up to I think its one of the best location of all downtown Montreal hotels  Its at the start of the shopping strip on St Catherine right in front of la Place des Arts performing arts center and the Contemporary arts museum  Thats If you walk toward the west  Heading east on St Catherine youll find yourself in the middle of a ton of strip clubs the University district and the gay village a  minute walk away   minutes heading east youll also end up on St Laurent and St Denis which has tons of great restaurants with nices patios  Its also where the French clubbing scene happens the more quotEnglish clubbingquot scene where most of the underage american students go is on Crescent much farther away but heading west  Old Montreal altough we didnt go Ive walked from this hotel to Old Mtl before and its a  minute walk If youre a quick walker  minute walk If youre legs arent what they used to be  This being my th time or so in Montreal I can tell you that you will waste time taking the subway changing from the green to the orange line will be necessary so youll go east and then back west again  But the M tro subway is a safe and quick way to practically anywhere else But If youre like me and you like walking walk youll discover Montr al more Dont be bothered by the homeless and punks begging on the streets this is a very safe city and they are harmless well most of them exceptions exist everywhere  Toronto might look quotcleanerquot in that respect but I believe this is mostly due to the fact that beggars are not tolerated by law in T O while this isnt the case in Montreal  Finally the hotel is in the huge quotComplexe Desjardinsquot which is  office towers connected with a shopping mall the Hyatt and the immense underground garage  Something I noticed in a previous review the subway IS accessible without going outside practical in the winter time  Take the parking elevators to Level  quotPlacequot lobby is on the th floor SERVICE I thought the service was excellent  I dont think it compares to anything Ive received in the last  years in Montreal  Hotel was sold out but  clerks were working the reception desk and I got my room in  minutes  Had requested  doubles non smoking and thats what I got  The Francofolies stage being in front of the hotel she asked If I would prefer a room on the th floor with a view and the music or a quieter one on the th floor at the back on the Regency Club Level  I opted for the later but the rooms are apparently all the same anyways  Still great that they asked  Contrary to the previous reviewer the concierge gave us wonderful restaurants reccomendations and was extremely polite  Security staff pool staff everyone was nice and greeted us without being overwhelming  Not pretentious at all either  Even though we are French speakers I didnt see English speaking guests being treated differently ROOMS Great reations  Now thats really something theyve changed since they took over in   Everyting was new and modern GREAT bed Pillotop mattresses and tons of feather pillows  They did have fitted sheets  CD player in room mini fridge quiet but cold AC and finally they did the bathrooms which are now up to par The room is exactly like what you see on the Hyatt website  Hallways a little dark but its the modern cool style of the hotel I guess  Its relaxing to say the least POOLFITNESS This as also changed since WyndhamMeridien    I definately think that anyone whos seen the pools shape before and after will agree that it was larger and nicer before  BUT the fitness facilities the terracegardens and the pool area overall are much brighter and feel like a little oasis in the middle of town  Very nice  PARKING Warning Do not use the Valet parking  Its outrageously overpiced and  spoil your stay  At  per daytips its definately a rip off even in Montreal  This becomes even more obvious when you know that they park you car in the Complexes garage just like it has been done since it opened in  and you can do just the same yourself and from Friday  p m to Monday  a m the daily maximum is    nights   with taxes  Hyatts rate      I saved  On weekdays I saw a daily max of     youre still saving     So dont be puzzled pass the front entrance of the hotel on Jeanne Mance and a few meters after youll see the sign for quotParking Complexe Desjardinsquot  It is all the same and elevators will get you right to the lobby Overall I will say book with confidence and ignore the negative reviews  Its comfy quietly luxurious and well located in my top  Montreal hotels  I wouldnt book it at more than night though  
P => Cannot say enough good things about it Just came back from a  night stay at the Hyatt and we loved it  The room was very tastefully orated staff was very pleasant and helpful and the hotel is only a block away from the metro Thats their subway system Suggestions If bringing your car dont park at the hotels parking its  nite Around the corner on Bleury Street you can find parking for nite  As for the metro which is very easy to navigate do yourself a favor and buy the  day tourist pass only  or  CAD cant remember   but well worth it as its good for the metro AND the busses otherwise each arate ride is     Also regarding the metro the easiest way to access it from the hotel is to walk out the main entrance amp go right towards the art museum stay on Jeanne Mance with the museum on your right   at the end of the street is the metro  It took us almost  days to figure that out Theres a ent place for breakfast  block on Ste Catherine walking away from the museum from the hotel called Petit Dejeuner at least it was the only words I noticed on the restaurant   which means Breakfast apparently   they serve breakfast until pm Good for those late nite partiers And if you are into the barclub scene make sure you hit Crescent Street thats definately where the action is 
P => Great Hotel Great Location This was my first visit to Montreal and we had to find a hotel on relatively short notice  We used an online service to book the hotel and received a great rate of  US per night for  nights  While we were there there was a giant music festival going on in the streets below La Francofiles or something like that   we couldnt hear a thing in the hotel room  The hotel is within walking distance of Old Montreal and the river the metro is right across the street the underground mall can be accessed through the basement and the rooms were very clean spacious and quiet  Good AC  I did not access the pool or fitness center to comment on that  There is a parking garage attached underground which cost about  for three days  The parking garage is so clean its almost sterile  The service was great as well  If youre worried about not speaking French   dont  Everyone in Montreal readily switched between fluent French and English without making you feel stupid  If you can get the same rate it is a spectacular bargain  Enjoy Montreal  
P => Great stay Stayed there during the grand prix week end  Very friendly and professional staff a ent breakfast clean and comfortable rooms brand new bathrooms  We had a regular room and it was just what you would expect from a good quality hotel   clean spacious nice beds convenient location stayed all over the world   had better but this is what you pay for in this case  I was a bit concerned having read some of the negative reviews on this site but had a good time and no problems at all  Highly recommended for either a business or a private stay And yes Montreal is French speaking  They speak English at the hotel fine but nobody is expected to speak English where other languages are official  
P => Hyatt Montreal in y  My friend and I had a wonderful stay at the Hyatt recently  Our criteria are listed below and all were more than amply satisfied Easy to reserve I booked online via the hyatt website  Reasonable cost I booked a super break deal for  nights which included breakfast and twin beds  TIP register in the loyalty programme Hyatt Gold Passport  You can request high floors and an upgrade at check in  We were upgraded to a Regency Club Room spacious with  double beds a great view floor to ceiling windows and a complimentary fruit basket  Cost was CAD   EUR   excluding   off the third night given at check out for  nights per room including breakfast  Location  Was central close to the Underground Shopping Mall around  minutes gentle stroll to the Old Port area and best of all located directly above the Les Jardins shopping complex  Good service  Staff were very friendly and attentive to our requests e g  concierge   for directions reception for room service other queries  Cleanliness  The room we were assigned was very clean  It is possible to request anti allergy pillows and linens  ent breakfast  This was the highlight of our stay  An extensive array of breads fruits cooked food and drinks  Including porridge french toast with maple syrup and eggs cooked to order  Really fresh well cooked and with kind waiting staff   Fitness facilities  The hotel has adequate fitness facilities weights machines cross trainer treadmill and bikes  It also has an indoor heated swimming pool around m in length  Open from  am onwards  Possible to have massages aswell  We took advantage of a  hr lymphatic drainage massage cost CAD  each  
P => my best hotel experience in montreal ever every summer i would travel to quebec for a short vacation with my kids  we have stayed at different hotels but my stay at hyatt regency proved to be our best experience so far  the staff were very nice friendly and helpful  the loacation was conveient for downtown shopping and dinning  and my kids love the swimming pool very muchl  our room was clean and spacious  will definitely stay at this hotel again  keep up the good work  
P => Strike  Like most of Montreal hotels Hyatt Montreal was on strike on friday y th  Something about provincial laws making that if employees are on strike they cant hire workers to replace them so hotels have to operate only with managers  Working in this industry for several years now I cannot beleve of the incompetence of these managers filling for their employees  At the front desk waited  min to cin room wasnt perfectly cleanned bad job in the bathroom messed up my order  times at the bar  The next day employees were back on the job sure glad they were back These employees are competent deliver good customer service and are better at dealling with busy periods of the day  I had one manager throw a fit at me because i was complaining on how the service that day was so crapy he did not apologise for the situation that was going on  I would have left this hotel but my understanding was other hotels had the same situation going on They deserve everything they ask for in their contract negociations  And mister General Manager your department managers need some training in good customer service prontoBecause of the employees this is a great hotel and would come back I would not come back for the management team  
P => Solid choice Just returned from a  day stay at this Hyatt  This would be a  star AAA hotel nothing special not terrible  It is in a convenient location for walks to the Latin Quarter Old M shopping etc  I would not pay over  US per night for this hotel considering that you have to add C per day for parking and exhorbitant   taxes  
P => Hyatts a great option Stayed here for two nights part of the Montreal Sweet Deals promotion which worked out great because it was a great value for what we got Getting to the lobby was initially confusing because you need to use one elevator to get to the lobby which is on the th floor of Complex Desjardins  Check in was easy and then we had to use a different set of elevators to get to our room  The whole two elevator thing is a bit disorienting at first but easy to get used to We got a two double bed room with great modern or  Bathrooms were great though the tub is shallow definetly not something you can soak in  The best feature of the room though all of it was great were the beds We loved the sealy pillow top mattresses the pillows and the duvet    we all agreed that it was actually more comfortable than our beds at home There is a pool and gym in the building  The indoor pool is nicely situated with lots of k space chairs and sunlight coming through the windows  The gym was downstairs from the pool the equipment a bit older and few but there is a new gym facility that has been constructed in a room by the pool  We peeked and there was lots of nice new equipment but we were told its not open yet Location is pretty good and the convenience of being in Complex Desjardins meant that it was a very short trip if we ever needed anything like food snacks ampc  We had the buffet breakfast in the hotel and it was pretty good  I think theres good enough variety for whatever youd want like cereals yogurt fruits juices an omelet station along with your bacon sausages french toast breads danishes ampc  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and formal All in all its a great place with amenities to boot  
P => Update I agree with the latest general consensus  In il  I had my fourth or fifth stay at the Hyatt in the past  and the hotel continues to upgrade  This winter some new and sleeker furnishings were added and the bathroom was updated  Yes the archaic wall mounted hairdrying contraption has been retired and replaced by a hand dryer  Bed was nice and comfy  Guest rooms are not chic or boutique but the rooms are clean modern and comfortable As mentioned in past reviews this location is the best in the city    on Ste  Catherine St near the major blvds  of St  Laurent and St  Denis directly above Metro station access  Close to everything from Place des Arts to the funky trendy Plateau neighborhood to Chinatown to the Old City to the red light district  Ample dining options are available just downstairs  The rate for parking at the Complexes Desjardins underground parking center is typical of Montreal    coming in this time at around CD per  hours  USD per day Room rates at this Hyatt are commensurate with the location and setting    not cheap but not excessive and careful and st shoppers can find discounts  I always do  
P => great hotel great location    My fiancee and I stayed at the Montreal Hyatt for  nights in il   We made our reservations on Hotwire and then read the reviews here on Tripadvisor  Several reviewers reported problems when using sites such as Hotwire and Priceline so I ided to contact the hotel to help ensure that wed receive a KingNon smoking room upon checkin  I also confirmed that I was guaranteed for late arrival  Upon check in we were greeted enthusiastically and were checked in efficiently  The room was very nice  The reations scheduled for completion in  must be mostly finished  Our room looked just like the one on the website  Weve stayed in Montreals Hotel Nellgan and the new rooms at the Hyatt are fairly similar to the rooms at the Nelligan  Obviously there is a difference between a boutique hotel like the Nelligan and the Hyatt but there is also quite a price difference  Especially at Hotwire prices We had no problems at all with room service which we used once  The room was cleaned very well each day and we had turn down service each night  I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this Hyatt to anyone  The reations look great the rooms are very stylish  Our view looking over Place des Arts was wonderful especially at night  Last but not least the hotel is in a fantastic location    truly in the heart of downtown Montreal  The Old Port is right behind the hotel and Ste  Catherines street is right out the door and to the left  No problems here I suspect some of the bad reviews came during the reation or be even when the hotel was a Wyndham last year  So dont worry     stay at the Hyatt    call before you go and confirm you are getting what you expect    be polite and Im sure youll have a pleasant stay  
P => Alexandra especially loved the pool and the snow outside My husband  year old granddhter and I stayed at the Hyatt in late ember   It was the best hotel we stayed in during our  week holiday in North America  Close to all attractions the foodhall and shopping centre we dont want to see another foodhall or theme park again Alexandra loved the pool and the attendants were thoughtful and polite  Extra towels were provided on request  All staff were extremely helpful and welcoming  The view over the Arts Centre was wonderful  The temperature was freezing outside but not as bad as Ottawa where we experienced  degrees  Too cold for the Aussies  
P => Very good stay    Stayed in early ch  for three nights with my wife and two kids  The room was terrific  Although I booked through Priceline the hotel honored my request for a nonsmoking rm with two beds  I called from the car about  hours in advance and arrived at pm  Room had clearly been reated recently  Staff were very pleasant You simply cant beat the location  atop a mall with a ent food court AND a superket   Walking distance from Old Town and  near lots of night life Only complaint is that the halls were noisy at night  Perhaps St  Patricks Day had something to do with itTips I self parked and heard other guests complaining about difficulty with ransoming cars from valets  Go with self park unless you expect alot of in outs  Free highspeed wifi in lobby  I worked  hours per day in the lobby while the others in my party slept and I always found an electrical outlet and a comfortable chair  Cheers 
P => A Special Experience I bought a package that included a gift casino money and second night at half price  When I booked at the Hyatt I found out that breakfast was also included  I went with a friend for a quotgirls weekend awayquot My stay was phenomenal  When I requested extra coffee for the room I was forgotten  Not only was an apology forthcoming when I returned to my room there was an apology note a bowl of fruit and a small bottle of wine  The rooms are spacious clean and comfy  The beds are the most comfortable that I have ever slept in  The duvets and throw pillows were a special added touch The entire staff were friendly helpful and pleasant  Special thanks to Benoit the concierge  He was always smiling and outgoing without being obtrusive  The breakfast was buffet style with an omelette station  The variety was plentiful  I would stay at the Hyatt again at any time  I will recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be treated special and feel as if they are the only guests  
P => would stay   the hyatt again The Hyatts best attribute is its proximity to major attractions which makes getting around town quick and easy  Overall my stay was pleasant the rooms were clean and well maintained the facilities were great and the staff were always friendly  The hair dryers were a bit odd but other than that I have no complaints 
P => Location Location Location and great service Just back from a weekend in Montreal at the Hyatt Regency at Complexe Desjardins  Previous reviewers are correct that the pillows are a bit slim but otherwise we had a great stay  Staff was attentive breakfast buffet extensive and delicious room or new and attractive and the location is quotthe locationquot  We visit Montreal often and when not staying in an apartment the Hyatt will be our spot  Special tip Bring your own hairdryer  The contraption hanging from the bathroom ceiling was interesting but not much of a hair dryer  I wish I knew that one could post pictures   this would be classic  Find a deal and stay in the center of the action   
P => Hyatt Regency Montreal    not as bad as what you read Why does this hotel receive bad reviews I paid  per night including tax via Priceline     and would do it again without hestitation  No need paying for high speed internet as the lobby has wi fi service for free Access to the underground shopping including an IGA grocery store  If you have never traveled to Montreal there is a   tax addded to virtually everything but grocery items  For those who are on a budget like myself IGA was very helpful  Two metro stops are near by one of which is underneath the hotel    if you dont mind the  minute walk to get there which is not a bad thing after eating all the great food offered in Montreal  
P => WONDERFUL HOTEL  I spent  days at this wonderful hotel in t  and loved every minute of my stay  I have traveled all over the world and this hotel was one of the best  I m not sure why other people had problems but we never encountered a rude staff member  They were eager to assist us by calling cabs and giving advise about the average cab fares  They booked boat cruises for us and provided great information about the area  The rooms were large clean and well furnished  We had  beds with a coffee area deskchair and a chair by the window overlooking the downtown area  The location is perfect with a metro station in the next block  We walked most of the time because everything was so close  We enjoyed sipping coffee on late afternoons and evenings at the sidewalk cafes  There is a mall under the Hyatt with a food court and an IGA superket  There are all types of food establishments on every block in the downtown area and they serve more food that a country girl could eat  I will stay at the Hyatt Montreal on every future trip  
P => Hyatt is Not As Bad as the Reviews Ive Read I just got back from a  night stay at this hotel and at first I was scared after reading reviews on here  This place was pretty good for me  I had no problems and I booked my room on Priceline and not once did they treat me differently  I had a quiet room and never heard any noise  The housekeeping staff is a little chintzy with the toiletries they need a soap dish in the shower and new pillows but for the price I paid it was well worth it  I never had issues with either elevator to get to rooms and the ones to the underground  This hotel is a great value if you can get a ent rate  The staff was friendly and the hotel is in a good location  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Not deserving of the Hyatt brand Priceline bookers take heed this hotel does not deserve its  star rating and they will treat you like a second class visitor for using Priceline I stayed at the Hyatt ust    and was pretty disappointed  Despite requesting a king size bed through my Hyatt Gold Passport upon arrival I was told my husband and I would have a double bed  Not a double room but a double bed  The room itself  if youre interested is actually one half of a suite and is not quotnormal sizedquot  In addition to a folding Murphy bed with a lumpy mattress one thin quilt and two small pillows it has a view of the roof top airconditioning unit  We requested a cot and were told that it would not fit through the door quot However we arrived in the room and a cot was squeezed into the space between the folding bed and the window  The small dark bathroom was clean but would not fit two people standing side by side  Two bath towels were provided one hand towel and there were no robes as is standard Hyatt  The unhelpful front desk staff the word imperious comes to mind noted that because we had booked through priceline there was nothing they couldwould do  This refrain was repeated by the manager who ultimately and very reluctantly agreed to move us to a normal sized room the following night  The elevator situation is ridiculous requiring you to take one elevator from the underground to the lobby then up a small flight of stairs and around the corner to the rooms elevator  Makes sense from a security perspective but an inconvenient and time consuming method  Elevators are busy at all hours of the day and evening so expect to wait Internet charges are an insane hour at the business centre and it doesnt appear to be high speed  If youre on a budget traveling solo and want a safe clean stay this might be your hotel  If youre expecting a Hyatt experience however youre better off somewhere else  
P => not worthy of the Hyatt brand Stayed here for two nights from ust     The positives as many have already noted the location especially if you plan to do a lot of walking is excellent  The newly reated pool is also very nice  Nothing else lives up to the expectations of a Hyatt Regency  The negatives unwelcoming front desk staff slow elevators plus you have to take one up to the reception area and another to your room drab or indifferent concierge one computer with a slow internet connection in the quotbusiness centerquot and dated washrooms  We booked our room through Priceline and were forced to accept something that at best could be described as a non standard room and at worst a good size closet  It was one half of a business suite and it was furnished with an alleged double size murphy bed There is no way two normal size people could ever comfortably sleep on that bed  When we complained about the ridiculous accommodations we were informed that the hotel was fully booked and besides we had prepaid through priceline  It was only after a lengthy discussion with the manager that the hotel reluctantly agreed to move us to a normal room the next night  I recognize that you give up some choice for savings when you use priceline but that does not mean that a hotel should be allowed to place you in a makeshift room that no directly booking guest would ever accept  It is shameful for a hotel carrying a brand as respected as the Hyatt Regency to even consider placing guests in inadequate rooms regardless of how the reservation was made  
P => Fantastic Location Just got back from Montreal and stayed at the HYatt Montreal  This location is perfect Sits right on top of the underground city we could actually walk underground to within two blocks of the old city so weather was never a problem  Sits on top of subway line so we could get anywhere in the city within minutes  Went to an Expos game one night and never went outside  Down elevator to subway and came up underneath Olympic stadium  fantastic  Parked car in garage and never touched it  PArking garage is safe and secure  and immaculate  Hey one hint  dont pay high priced restaurant charges in Hotel eat downstairs in food court esp  if you have kids we saved a fortune  
P => Location Location Location  The only good thing about this hotel is location  Walking distance to Vieux Montreal Basilica Chinatown etc  You only need to take the car out one day for Biodome Botanica Garden and Olympic Park  Parking is  on weekends and  for week days About the hotel   Located above the mall quotComplexe Desjardinsquot the rooms is old and small  We had three rooms reserved for early ust  We requested double beds and non smoking rooms but did not get them  All of our three rooms were smoking rooms single pull down full size bed which barely sleeps two  The room is smaller than my closet at home  It has the cheapie mattress similar to the sofa bed type and it folds into the wall when not being used  We called to request additional roll away bed for each room and it took them over an hour to deliver the beds well over AM  The carpet smells and old  The hair dryer looked like it was from  with only one low speed  After  minutes of drying my dhters hair still wet and the handle started to heat up  Only  of our  rooms had a coffee maker  The furniture at the lobby is old and wear out  To be fair I did like a few things from this hotel that worth mentioning  The water pressure in the shower was great  Strong and never run out of hot water  Two of our rooms has great city view but was noisy from the music festival during that week  We also liked the clean indoor pool and the malls food court is downstairs which made it very convenience to grab a quick bite Bottom line  The hotel needs to be updated with new furnitures carpet hair dryer better mattress and bigger room  Otherwise it should not have the Hyatt name  
P => y  great location  Great downtown location you can walk to many attractions  Traffic is a pain during the time people travel to work leave your car  Parking is  a day canadian but this is a major city and downtown location so thats par  Cabs are everywhere  The room was nice although there were some unpainted plaster repairs on the walls might bother some people  Nice bathroom  Got it for about night on hotwire   Overall a good value and a nice place to see the downtown from during the day and retreat to with the one you love at night

P => Excellent hotel spoiled by pointless hidden costs My experience at the Intercontinental was somewhat polarized  On the one hand both the hotel and the service were excellent comfortable rooms well orated clean and with good facilities great location close to downtown the Metro and the old city helpful staff   especially Gerry the concierge who had a wealth of knowledge and always had time to share it his help definitely added a lot to our Montreal experience  All of this definitely deserved the high ratings and reviews On the other hand the hotels policies really hampered our stay with the  nickel and diming  Internet  a day or  for  hours there are Internet shops that make all their money from Internet services that charge less than that Early check in if available  Late check out even just a half hour another  Breakfast starts at  for juice coffee and two pastries Room service additional fee etc etc  It really felt like every request we had incurred an extra fee which is absolutely not what a top class hotel should feel like  I mean if you were spending one night for a meeting in Montreal and your flights meant that you had to check in before pm and leave after noon thats  extra right there just for absolutely standard services that every other hotel even the Holiday Inn Express brand in the same chain is happy to offer for free If a room is not ready for early check in thats perfectly understandable but how is it fair to say your room is ready but if you dont wait around until pm you have to pay extra This isnt some kind of pay by the hour flophouseIf you get a good deal on the price I would recommend the Intercontinental  I feel kind of bad about being so negative because none of the staff provided any bad service nor were the facilities below standard  I just feel that in a  or  star hotel you expect to be encouraged to approach the staff to make any requests that you need and that the establishment should try to accommodate these out of goodwill to enhance your stay as a valued guest  By the end of my stay I felt like it wasnt even worth asking for anything because Id just have to pony up or feel embarrassed to line because of the fees  If you stay here you will not be disappointed by the staff or the hotel   just expect to add an extra   or so to your quoted rate so you dont feel disappointed by that part either  
P => Very good business choice Stayed at the Intercontinental on business  I was very impressed with everthing save for the valet parking The hotel itself is very nice   lobby bar and rooms are very nicely orated and contemporary  My king bed was comfy and I had a great view of Mont Royal  Bathroom was big with great standup shower  Location is handy   close to businesses on La Gauchetiere but also not too far from Old Montreal  The building it is in in Montreal is really neatly designed  Part modern and part retained historical buildings  In fact the meeting rooms are acroos the bulding concourse to the historic side of the building  Very cool I got a good business rate  which made it a good value  The mini bar is equipped with sensors so they knew what I had consumed before I left   which I liked because it means you dont get double billed for the mini bar  Only drawback was the valet parking  I use it and expect to pay especailly in Montreal  The entrance for the hotel is down a level from the lobby and there was often no doorman the entrance to help with valet parking  When departing I needed to leave in a hurry after my conference and sp personally pre arranged with the doorman to have my car brought up at a specific time  Unfortunately I arrived to find it not there with no one to help me  I ended up waiting  minutes which resulted in me getting cht in traffic and very late for my meeting  Pretty inexcusable for a top rated hotel  That being said it was the only glitch so I will probably be back  
P => Acceptable but nothing special and dont expect anyone to be friendly  The room has nice amenities  I liked the arate shower and bathtub and the big screen TV  The sheets and towels were in the high quality category but nothing special the bath amenities were similarly high quality but nothing special the staff were professional but nothing special room service was good for room service but nothing special  quotAcceptable but nothing specialquot describes the entire hotel which is why the best adjective I can come up with is quotnicequot  The waiting times at reception were very long and there never seemed to be enough help  When I checked in the receptionist spent a solid minute explaining how the mini bar could not be tricked as it had a computerized system with various failsafes built in  For instance keeping the door of the minibar open for more than one minute would cause you to be charged  Needless to say I did not feel like a welcome guest nor did I use the minibar the entire time I was there  The staff was professional but the amount of friendliness I experienced was directly proportional to the amount they thought I would tip  I usually tip quite well   especially for a place like Montreal where tipping seems to be on the low   ish side  Only what I consider a quite generous tip would generate any sort of genuine thanks   well faux genuine   lets say they put some effort into their thanks  I wasnt inspired to do that many times only a few when I did ask for something I would consider quotextraquot  This illustrates the entire staffs attitude I called reception the day before arrival to let them know what time our flight would be landing and asked if they could try to have our rooms ready around pm  hours before regular check in time  The managers response was that for  per room and we had  rooms he could guarantee early check in  I asked him if he could just be aware and  try  and he replied that no he could not but that for  per room he could guarantee it  Other members of our group on the same flight were staying at  other nearby hotels and those hotels all agreed with no problem to help us with early check in   and they provided it too There were  better than blah experiences  One I had one excellent room service meal but only because I stopped by the restaurant and ordered from the chefs daily specials instead of using the room service menu  Two I received excellent service from the concierge who I noticed wore the keys of a professional concierge on his collar  I expect his professional quotfriendlinessquot was more the result of his professional training and less the result of the influence of the hotel  Only a highly conscientious professional could keep from showing their cynicism in such a working environment  Im not giving perfect ks on cleanliness because one of my drawers had pastry crumbs and a bakery bag left in it and because the pool tiles needed to be cleaned although the water seemed well maintained  However I do believe that the room was generally cleaned well I am recommending this hotel with the above caveats because  you do get exactly what you pay for   no more but no less either   and  it is directly across the street from the Palais des Congres conference center and that is a wonderful thing if youre at a conference  If youre not at a conference there is absolutely no reason to stay at this hotel  
P => quiet hotel interesting area    Loved Montreal although most of the people there kept telling me Quebec was more beautiful Stayed in a club room at the top of the hotel and the room was large the hotel quiet and the service good  The only oddity was the club lounge was on the ground floor behind a glass door that other guests kept knocking on because they didnt know what the room was and how to get it  The staff in the club lounge were great and kept the coffee coming and topped up drinks before tidying away for the night Hotel is practically in the main conference centre and is within easy walking area of the old city with its cafes and bars and restaurants  Much of Monteal seems to be covered areas and underground malls and walkways  Kind of like Singapore but expecting snow    but its worth getting out and be walking up to the park if work allows  
P => Nicely reated great city location We stayed here for  nights in early emebr and really enjoyed our stay It is located on the edge of Old Montreal and central to most things and close to the Metro  It was a fairly short walk to St  Catherine Street for those who like to shop The room was quite nice and roomy the or was lovely  We ate at their restaurant Osco one evening and also had a drink at their Absinthe bar  Sarah  B  The staff were friendly and helpful We did have to call  days in a row for more than one face cloth  High speed internet was  per  hours  
P => Fantastic friendly place I stayed here for four days to attend a conference  The rooms are beautiful  recently reated very well laid out huge ble bathrooms comfortable beds  I was given a corner room which was very nice  Never heard a sound from other guests  Every single staff member I encountered was very friendly  They generously let me stumble along in French and they moved with ease between French and English I ate dinner there the first night and it was delicious  the scallops were especially good  The breakfast buffet was relatively modest  but in a way I liked  Most hotel buffets are too excessive  This one has just what you need  with wonderful fresh ingredients for omelettes which were beautifully prepared The location was perfect for a conference since it was just across the street from the Palais des Congres but also close to Old Montreal  I would definitely stay there with my family  My only complaint is one that applies to most big chain high cost hotels  day for wireless is outrageous  Youd earn so much more loyalty if you simply made it free  
P => Stay here if you like being treated like crap Most ignorant staff we have ever encountered  Sheets on bed had stain had to ask twice for them to be changed  Hit in the back of the head by plate carried by server who did mildly apologize but barely  All staff minus concierge and fitness room attendant came with attitudes could care less about doing their jobs and made us feel like we were a nuisnace to them  Do yourself a favor and stay somehwere else that is not Unionized  
P => Nearly Perfect Experience at the Intercontinental Montreal I had a fantastic time over two nights at the Intercontinental Montreal  The public spaces are understated and very stylish and the staff are professional and friendly  I was upgraded to a turret room with excellent views north and west though there are those spiders outside the windows that many others have mentioned  A couple of problems were taken care of very quickly wine that I ordered wasnt available but I was given something more expensive and very good instead and at the original price  There was also a problem with my TV but a very nice repairman visited my room quickly and took care of things  The location is excellent for those interested in seeing Old Montreal or doing shopping in the city centre both are just a few blocks away  The rates are quite reasonable given the elegance of the hotel  I will stay here again when I return to Montreal  
P => Had the pleasure of experiencing the Intercontinental I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Intercontinental this past weekend  I had brought my mother to montreal for a day of shopping and a great supper out  Our room was recently reated and beautifully orated  Great beds and linens  Many business people there so I assume that they find it a good experience also  Bathrooms are large and the shower is arate from the bathtub  Service at the front desk and from the bellmen was excellent  Had the brunch the next morning and it was very good and fresh lovely smoked salmon Only complaint that I had was the service from one of the waitresses in the bar left a lot to be desired  Wasnt that busy there late at night and it took quite a while to get served and have her come back to see if we wanted anything more  
P => Very Nice   Great Location We stayed here with Priority Club points and were upgraded to a nice corner room on the rd floor   great views although the outside of both windows were somewhat covered in cobwebdusty debris  The hotel has just been remodeled   its lobby area is sort of minimilist   nice but not really my taste  The room had a very comfortable king bed sofa and large flat screen tv  The bathroom was lovely with a arate tub and shower  We parked in the parking garage which is adjacent to the hotel  No problem for us as we were just staying overnight and had little luggage   but you do have to walk through a small quotretail type areaquot to get from the garage to the hotel  We found the location to be great   right on the edge of Old Montreal   we easily walked to all points in Old Montreal  Staff was very friendly  
P => Great Stay Great Location My husband and I took the advice of our friend Linda K  and travelled to Montreal for a long weekend  Linda recommended the InterContinental and we are glad she did  The hotel is modern clean and in a great location  Chantel their concierge is very nice and knows all of the best restaurants to dine  
P => Great hotel close to everything   ideal for either business or pleasure trip  We were very happy with our  day stay at the InterContinental in Montreal  Excellent rooms a great hotel restaurant the breakfast buffet was a great chance to introduce the kids to French pastries and cooking and very good service from every member of the staff  We give them extra credit for the well appointed bathroom and big flat screen TV One small suggestion   use the valet parking service since the parking spots reserved for the public are on levels   in the underground garage It s a really long trip down to get to them plus we had to take no less than  different elevators to get from our room to the car  Lesson learned  
P => Up to the que I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal with my wife and two teenage girls I booked two Club rooms via the hotel website at a cost of CAD   each per night The hotel location was excellent being close to the night scene restaurants and harbour front though upon arrival you  feel that you are being greeted at the rear of the hotel Upon arrival the valet attendant took charge of both our car and luggage and we were directed upstairs via an escalator to a seamless check in experience  Rooms were allocated on the th floor and luggage delivery was prompt  The views from the Club floor were excellent and the lounge a quiet haven for breakfast and afternoon drinks Service throughout was professional and courteous and the recent reations of a very high standard  A special thanks to the staff at reception and the lady in the Club lounge who always wore a smile  
P => Location and price were an excellent combination This was a fabulous hotel  It is convenient to everything  Still have a few quirks to work out since reation but overall it was great  If you are traveling by train to Montreal takea cab from the terminal  Only a couple of dollars more  Easy to get to Old Montreal  When using the subway use the Square Victoria station  Weather permitting go out entrance on Rue St  Antoine and turn left  Subway at next corner or you can go unerground  Found excellent place for breakfast on Rue Notre Dame  It is the Notre Dame restaurant  Cozy great food and owners very nice and friendly  
P => great hotel Along with  other friends I stayed in this hotel for a weekend   we drove from Toronto and it was super easy to find    parking is a little tricky at first when you arrive if you dont take Valet however once there no need to use the car again  Our room was amazing the beds were some of the most comfortable Ive ever slept on  Front desk agents were always welcoming the valetconcierge team were great help in recommending some great restaurants  This hotel is within walking distance to just about everything  Ill def stay here again  
P => A great hotel with mostly good service We stayed at the Intercontinental for a Saturday night using a ent Priceline rate  I had stayed there several years ago and had forgotten how nice the property is  We hadnt requested an early check in but were given a room when we tried to simply drop off our bags at AM  The room was average in size with nice amenities  The only thing missing was the typical hotel diectorybinder with hotel info  Also getting a previously requested crib did take a few extra calls  For families with kids the pool is a bit small and is really intended for lap swimming  The location is not really in the entertainment core and not really in Old Montreal   a small distance to everything but not overly far if you dont mind walking  Finally check out took way too long as there were not enough staff on  The TV check out option was down too Hopefully an isolated thing Other people have commented on the uneven service  I think thats probably the best description  Its a great  star property and the service is mostly good just not quite up to what  star type people expect  
P => Surprisingly nice We really liked our stay here  I was expecting somewhat blah looking rooms based on some of the photos I d seen and was very pleasantly surprised to see the lobby and rooms have been reorated very recently  The room s carpet is a dark oon and the furniture is a dark brown wood  The curtains are a lovely oon with a chrysanthemum pattern   very modern  The bathroom ble is probably old but the fixtures looked new  We stayed in  which was slightly smaller than our friends  room    both with king sized beds  The lobby was also new looking very different from some of the photos posted by reviewers   birch bark and fake fur  Sounds awful but it looks elegant The bed was nice and comfortable soft but not mushy  Pillows were nice and soft feather as well There was a nice Samsung flat screen TV and you get an ipod docking stationradioalarm clock it kept going off in the mornings and we kept forgetting to figure out how to turn it off We wandered into the bar called  Sarah B  at around pm on a Saturday night and it was filled with families   not exactly a happening scene  But nice to know you can bring your kids there and have some beers  They re advertising  cool  absinthe drinks there but it seems a bit out of place with the clientele I didn t have any interaction with the concierge myself but my friend overheard the gentleman concierge helping other guests and was very impressed  He said the concierge seemed very knowledgeable and steered the other guest toward some sensible recommendations The internet in the room is  per day and  for  min in the lobby  The concierge was nice enough to let me use the computer to quickly check my email for  minutes more than that and they d have to charge  We didn t think it was worth  for  min of internet use in the room or for  in the lobby for that matter We paid in the s per night for a Fri check in and Sun check out booked approx  weeks in advance on Priceline It s in the same plaza as Toque which is a really excellent restaurant and very pricey Cons  Neighborhood is dead need to travel to get to interesting neighborhoods  Expensive internet access guess that s the norm for most hotelsPros  Proximity to Old Montreal on foot  Nice job with reationsreorating  Good concierge 
P => Reations are Done Many of the recent reviews of this hotel noted the ongoing reations  Those now seem to be done and the hotel seems to be put back together We were given an upgrade a check in and found the room we were given to be spacious and nicely appointed My wife and I found the hotel to be very luxourious and in an excellent location to explore either the shopping district or the old port area of Montreal My beef however is with the parking arrangements for the hotel  Firstly hotel guests can only park on level  and lower so getting in and out of the garage is time consuming  Next getting from the parking to the hotel requires an evelator change and a bit of a walk to the front desk  If all that was not probelm enough the hotel has no arrangement with the garage to allow for in and out priviledges  This means that trips to dinner etc  rack up significant parking charges All in all its a very nice hotel but with a poor parking setup  
P => Great Hotel    just need to work out the kinks    I was a bit hesitant about staying here since the reviews were so mixed however I found this hotel to be great and suitable to our needs  For anyone that is concerned about the construction there should be no worries  The construction is really just a reation that is confined to just the loungebar area  No noise or dust anywhere  The staff were friendly and extremely accomodating  The manager hooked us up with a room upgrade to a suite room We also received a lot of great recommendations on where to sight see Parc du Mont Royal and where to drinkeat Weinstein and Gustovinos  Our suite room Room  is modern and nicely laid out  There were several issues that we did notice however did not really bother us all that much No hairdryer front desk asked us to look in the cabinet under the sink but it was a pedestal sink the bed was VERY firm and the linens a bit rough for my silky smooth skin  Oh and just a side note there were spiders on the exterior of the building no possible way of getting in but did anyone else notice that all of montreal is just crawling with spiders all over the placeParking was a bit odd  Hotel guests have to park in P P  which is  flights belowwe got a bit dizzy going in circles  The elevator is right there although it only goes as far up to the Food Court level  You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to the lobby to check in  Because of this set up there is no one to help you with your luggage if you do self parking  Odd Overall I really enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay here again  The neighborhood is a bit dead during the weekends however the Metro is right in the colorful convention center across the street and everything is within a  minute walk  
P => Great location and stay  Quality hotel  I was hesitant to stay here because of some of the reviews I read  However I had a great experience  The hotel is located within  minutes walking distance to the heart of Old Montreal and  minutes walking distance to downtown St  Catherines  It is very close to other hotels there is a cafe around the corner and down the street however it is not extremely close to popular eateries starbucks etc  except for a Steak Frites place across the street  The hotel itself is very nice  Although it is under reations the renos are confined to the main level area and make the lobby a bit smaller than expected  However the rooms are not affected and you cannot hear any construction noise  The conceirge is on the lobby level and was extremely friendly and helpful the front desk staff were somewhat friendly and the bell staff are located on the street level and are very friendly as well  The hotel provided umbrellas for rainy days free printing of boarding passes complementary slippers but you have to ask and free luggage storage when you check out The room I had contained  queen beds and had very dark or which I didnt like but it was clean and large  The pool was long and narrow but was nice enough  The spa had a steam room that was lovely  The gym seemed like a good facility although I did not use it   it had a treadmill and weights and other cardio machines The area is safe and I would stay here again  However as this hotel is not in the heart of old Montreal walking back at night is somewhat lonely as there arent too many people around  It could be spooky if you are a single traveller  The other thing is that when you check in they automatically charge you for newspaper delivery each night you are there  If you dont read the check in contract you are billed for this   make sure you line if you dont want this service  Also room service is VERY expensive I booked it on priceline for  USD per night  
P => Perfect location Travelled to Montreal with my sister in law and  yr old dhter and  year old niece  Stayed at the Intercontinental from y  y  for family party on the Saturday  Montreal is my hometown but moved over  years ago and only seem to get down for family functions and never spend anytime in this wonderful city  so ided to stay a few days and play tourist in the city I grew up in  The Intercontental is in a perfect spot  Walking distance to both Old Montreal and Downtown  We arrived Friday night and took the valet service since we were too tired to find parking and it was around  per day and we did not plan to use the car too much during our stay Reception is not thru the main door but up the escalators to your right thru sliding glass doors Check in was smooth and easy and we were on the th floor with a view of Old Montreal and surrounding area The hotel is still under some construction to what looks like a restaurtant or lounge The rooms were fabulous but after reading some reviews about no mini fridge I brought a small cooler which I kept full with ice to keep juice and milk cold for the girls and beer cold for the grownups There is a mini bar but I stay away from those  Not in the mood to pay   for a bottle of water CoffeeTea maker in the room  Only one coffee and one tea per day but it worked out since my sister in law is the coffee drinker and I am a tea lover and never needed to ask for more which I read from previous reviews you get charged for         not sure if that policy changed The pool was more of a lap pool but big enough for the kids to swim and was not very busy  It is located on the th floor with an outside k with not much of a view except an office building across the street  I did not stay out there since there were spider webs everywhere  Definately needs some attention We walked around Old Montreal on Saturday and even bought last minute tickets to Cirque du Soleil quotOvoquot for a matinee at pm  The tickets are pricey but cheaper than in Las Vegas  We had the best seats and the best view and paid  per adult and  per child under   I know in Vegas it was US for one of their shows for the good seats  We walked thru all the streets and there are many restaurants to chose from and many art galleries and souvenir shops  We were not there for the shopping but bought a beautiful bracelet in the Bonsecour ket on rue St Paul  Ins ide the building there are be  boutiques with all handmade stuff including glass and leather  worth a look  We took a caleche ride    horse and buggy    for  a half hour and it was a treat for the girls to learn the history of Montreal  The Vieux Port by the water was fun to walk around with more shops and there is a place for kids called the Labrynthe but they were not interested in visiting  Sunday we took the car and went to the mountain   Mount RoyalBeaver LakeLac aux Castors  I always lh at the word lake  It is a man made pond with paddle boats  We walked around and enjoyed the view from the top of down town Montreal  We jumped in the car and visited St Johs Oratory and learned the history of this magnificent church on the top of the mountain  Sunday night was the last night of the Jazz festival which was a  minute walk from the hotel  We stayed for about an hour since the girls were getting tired but enjoyed some of the free music on rue St Catherine  Sorry for the long review but wanted to cover everything  
P => Disappointed in this  stars Hotel Very disappointed in Intercontinental after entering the room was about to put my bags on the desk then I saw there were heavy dust on the top part of the desk as in where people use the least  I simply passed my finger and I can actually see dust on my finger tip  I then called front desk they sent the housekeeper up and clean it  Cant believe before the concierge left she told me that one person hs to clean average  rooms within two days  After she left i was about to put my other bags on a reading chair near corner end I then saw an empty  up bottle hidden under the chair  If i didnt slightly pushed the chair by accident i probably wouldnt know THE ROOM WASNT CLEAN AT ALL  Asked for an room exchange because didnt want to guess elsewhere wasnt clean  nd room still dusty on the desk the front desk claims the hotel just finished reation therefore for sure there would be dust  BUT isnt a  stars hotel HAS TO MAKE SURE THE ROOM IS CLEAN BEFORE THE GUEST ENTERING THE ROOM  THIS IS LIKE THE BASIC I still couldnt believe that quotreationquot was the excuse they use  If they knew there would be dust because of the reation which ended end on e  WOW after two weeks still very dusty unbelievable OVERALL disappointed  stars hotel FAILED on a very basic requirement Cleanness 
P => Lovely hotel good location uneven service Lovely hotel well located directly adjacent to Vieux Montreal Old Montreal and about a   minute walk from Centre Ville Downtown The Metro is about a  minute walk  Newly reated the rooms are spacious beautifully orated and well appointed  The very large ble bath with arate tub and shower is top notch  Priily a conventionbusiness hotel it can feel a bit stuffy and corporate    definitely not the best choice for a romantic rendez vous A downside is that the quality of the service was uneven  The employees were generally pleasant and professional but the hotel seemed understaffed with long wait times to speak with the concierge unanswered phone calls to room service and occasional long lines at the front desk  The quality of room service food was poor considering the high prices I would hesitate to pay full price for the hotel but there seem to be many heavily discounted rates available from various online site  At a discounted price its a very good deal  
P => Acceptable Although this hotel is attractive it is not a four star hotel  We bid  and got it for six nights at  per night  Good location close to old Montreal and the jazz festival  Good concierge but hotel staff did not inform us of free coffee in the lobby nor that all calls including  would be charged    Room was comfortable and attractive  
P => Excellent Hotel The hotel was one of the best that Ive ever stayed in  Its located close to everywhere we parked our car  day and walked everywhere  You could take the Metro its close by  But we ided to walk since our destinations are within walking distance Old Montreal St  Catherine etc  The bed is so comfy we had a large LCD tv in our room arate shower and bath front desk was very nice  I guess we were there where the constructionreation was done  We had a room that had a connecting door and could hear people from next room taking shower coughed and sneezed in the middle of the night  Didnt bother me that much because after a few minutes it stopped and I didnt hear anything else  One thing that I wish this hotel would have is free internet access or at least a cheaper rate  The internet rate was expensive we couldnt get browse the web trying to get directions or places to go  
P => Very comfy beds  of us came to Montreal for a stag celebration  Although the hotel lobby is under reations finished in end of e the rooms are fully made up  Quiet during the day and clean the thing I remember most is the nice soft fluffy beds and pillows that were so inviting when we retired at am in the morning  Sound proofing is excellent in this hotel and no complaints filed against us in the am  Location is good for the Old Montreal area otherwise there is very handy taxi stand in the front  Walk to Crescent street is about  mins St  Catherines central in about    There is a Steak Frites restaurant that is a BYO beer and wine across the street  It is connected to a mall with a food court with food for lunch and be breakfast  
P => Very comfortable stay I have to admit I was nervous when I saw the reviews most recently  However we truly enjoyed our stay at the Intercontinental  The lobby is still being reated so the check in process is a bit unusual but the staff makes you feel very welcome  The rooms are now reated and ours was excellent  We stayed on the th floor  Large flat screen TV nice coffee maker high speed internet and wireless for a fee with our room rate  The bathroom was very nice and everything was very clean  The location is good as well  Only a few steps from the Metro located only a few blocks from the Notre Dame Basilica a must see  We didnt use the pool gym or restaurant so cannot comment on those  However Gerry the concerige was very helpful in getting us to and from sitesplaces  Very friendly and very helpful  All in all a very pleasant stay  Our rate was through Priceline so the deal for us was excellent  night  
P => Had a great stay fantastic deal  Will be an excellent hotel once the reations are done I stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal in il   We got a fantastic rate through Travelzoo and knew that the reations werent complete yet  Check in was quick  We had a newly reated room with a big screen tv  The room was a good size clean and had a very large bathroom with arate shower and tub  The hotel was very quiet despite that the reations are still ongoing for the restaurant area on the nd floor  Our rate included internet though it is normally about  a day  Hotel location was great and the Metro can be accessed without going outside  The only reason I didnt give  star was because the lobby area was a bit disorganized but this is because of the reations  
P => had a great stop over I enjoyed my short stay in Montreal much to the credit of the intercontinental The hotel is located in the Quartier international district of Montreal adjacent to the Nordheimer Building where there are some shops pharmacy convenience store and great cheap restaurants with various international food We stayed in room  with a splendid view on the river We didnt have breakfast there but went to Chez Plume in the evening and it was lovely The staff overall in the hotel was great  The current refurbishing didnt bother us at all The pool was too cold  didnt try the gym Toiletries in the room are Elemis mmmmmTowels sheets  pillows are spotless clean and in abundance I recommend trying the underground metro which is so clean and efficient and visiting the Biodome with kids Overall as I said I found the place really good but somehow wouldnt stay more than  nights as there isnt much to do in winter that is and the pool is too cold  
P => Good location great room poor reception    I got there with my wife for Valentine Day hotel was under reation but overall access was appropriate  Upon check in five desk were set but only one clerk available  Wait in line then    Same thing to check out  Plume is a good close by restaurant  The hotel is next door of the famous St James Hotel so location is great  
P => Great for the Priceline price of night This place is MASSIVE  It is connected to other buildings but still it is absolutely huge  The parking garage alone is at least  levels underground  They were doing some remodeling so the lobby area was a little confusing and you had to take  elevators to get upstairs  The spaexercisepool area was very nice and we really enjoyed swimming and the steamsauna  We were there during snow and cold so it was nice to have things to do inside  The location is good and you can get to the subway without going outside at all  All in all a great deal 
P => Amazing hotel I have never been to a hotel and felt treated so well  I went on business and took my dhter and her best friend  Although the room was for one person the front desk had no trouble giving me a room with  beds The staff is amazing they are too nice and will do anything to accomadate your needs  The luggage boys are great they are in the entrance of the hotel  always smiling and assisting you  The rooms are great  The pool is a bit small but good enough and it closes at pm in my opinion it should be opened  just like the gym  Everything is perfect I would definatly recommend it  
P => excellent hotel to stay Excellent hotel to stay in downtown montreal Me and my wife enjoyed every single moment we stayed in this hotel  Spacious rooms clean bathrooms quiet comfortable bed to sleep in  Check in and check out was fast  friendly staff  Looking forward to stay in this hotel again  parking is just one block from the hotel on the left side  If you like fast foods there is a MC donalds just three blocks on rue st notredame but if you walk two more blocks after the mcdonalds there is lot of small family owned restaurants with good food  
P => Great Hotel in a Great Location Great hotel in a great location  Helpful staff large well appointed clean rooms All in all a very nice stay  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Very nice stay The Intercontinental has a great location in the heart of Montreal  We stayed in  rooms at the beginning and end of our vacation in Quebec  The first room  faced the The Palais des congr s Montr al s Convention Centre known for its massive multi coloured glass wall and Tim Hortons inside and Place Jean Paul Riopelle a lovely park with special effects along the pathways and in the fountain hint ring of fire  The kids loved the view  In the distance we could see the Mount Royal  The second room  was on the opposite side of the hotel facing the St  Lawrence River  The rooms are average size with very comfortable beds the bathrooms are very nice with a soaking tub and arate shower  The staff were extremenly poilte and helpful  I do not speak French and was pleased to find that the staff would immediatly switch to English based on my greeting  This hotel is connected to the underground pedestrian walkways  My only complaint was that there was no shop in the hotel or even within the block and the mini bar prices were very high  Plan ahead for snacks and drinks  The indoor pool on the th floor was small but adequate to entertain a  yr old and connected to an nice outdoor patio with several tables and chairs  The hotel rooms are located on the th floor and above  
P => Amazing location This was my first time staying at the Intercontinental hotel  It was a wonderful upscale hotel with perfect location right on the boarder of financial district and old Montreal  You can walk to Notre Dame cathedral  min Jacques Cartier square and riverfront  min shop at Rue Saint Catherine  min visit St  Patricks cathedral  min or climb Mount Royal  min  Everything is within walking distance  Subway station is right by the hotel and train station is about  min walk  Hotel itself was beautiful  ble art work expensive furniture and flowers everywhere  The entrace is kind of unusual   you have to take elevator to the lobby  We stayed here for  nights but didnt have a chance to try restaurant  We always ate out  Hotel is adjacent to a mall with interesting shops and cafes  We found it very convenient  Our suite was amazing  It was a corner room with oval shape  We had a nice view of park and the colorful Palace of Congress exhibition hall  The suite had lot of light and warm colors  Living room was very comfortable  TV channels were also in English  Bed had the nicest sheets and comforter ever  They made it hard for us to get up  Closet was a descent size  Bathroom was perfect  Fluffy robes were new and smelled nice  We also got very nice bathroom amenities  I forgot the name of the brand  Service was exceptional except for concierge who could have smiled more  However she provided good directions everywhere plenty of maps and recommendations  Actually everybody was very efficient knowledgable and professional  The staff went out of their way to help us especially front desk and bell men they stored our luggage and got us taxi few times  I will stay here again and recommend this hotel to all my friends  
P => way overpriced for what we got Just returned from a five night stay at this property  Paid  for a club floor room  Definitely not worth the money Pros Lovely view in a large room good hot water pressure ent bed and linens Cons the club floor offerings were extremely limited in scope and availability just continental breakfast and evening cheese crackers and drinks Service was reluctant  You have to call if you want turn down  and then it does not always come  The bellmendoormen can often not be bothered to assist because they are so involved in their own conversation  The concierge is happy to say quotI dont knowquot and leave it at that  Room service prices were exorbitant e g    for a bowl of dry cereal plus service and delivery  Internet is   a day  Furnishings in the rooms and public areas were dark worn and dated  Plastic flowers and low lighting All this is acceptable in a three star hotel or if the rate is  through Priceline  However when a hotel is classed as five star and is advertised as quality I find these failings unacceptable  
P => ent hotel stayed in this hotel for  nights pros  really close to old montreal min walk eaton center min walk  we accidently opened the mini fridge there is a tab on it and we didnt get charged for it  friendly service we put do not disturb sign we came back and there was a note and a voicemail asking if we wanted our room cleaned to let the staff know  and a personal visit to ask us as well   bathroom is big and spaciouscon  hotel is on a one way so when we passed it the first time we had to loop around to find the entrance again  after parking in their underground parking lot public parking is at least  floors down got dizzy from driving round and round downwards after taking the elevator to the main floor finding the entrance was difficult not the same as the main hotel entrance  tv volume didnt go any higher than what it was when you turned it on  coffee maker is on the bathroom counter 
P => Awful mattress The four things I look for in a good hotel are  firm mattress because getting a GOOD nights sleep is important individually controlled AC that works strong shower pressure  and QUIET soundproof room  It can make the difference between ruining a  day vacation or making it great  The GOOD  common areas were air conditioned  large sink with excellent water pressure   on PricelineThe BAD  extra charge for coffee in the min bar if you use more than the one free package of coffee located in the bathroom  no shampoo i had to make a special request  i emailed hotel prior to stay about my preference for a high floor but was only given th floor out of   i purchased  day metro pass at  but only used it once because the subway has NO air conditioning and the heat is unbearable  the mattress was so lumpy you could see the unevenness even when the bed was completely made with the comforter on   mini bar had a tab you had to break so the hotel would know you opened it therefor i never opened it to cool MY store bought pop  no free internet  hotel charges for internet  escalator to lobby has no handicap access  construction noise of new hotel across street  first priceline room they gave me smelled and completely reeked of cheap artificial cleaner or some other mysterious unpleasant odor so i immediately asked to change rooms  huge stain on carpet at end of bed  one of my neatly folded white towels the maid had left for me in the bathroom literaly had quotskid ksquot feces on it when i opened the towel up to dry myself  this completely grossed me out  the trash had not been emptied from the previous tenant  worst mattress ever  it felt like sinking into quick sand and completely swallowed you in  it was not firm and had no spine  felt like sleeping on a lumpy spineless pillow  worst pillows smelly ever  feathers flying everywhere from the pillow  sheets and pillow had unpleasant odor  sheets were thin and not of a high quality  star thread count  tiny shower i could barely move around in  aggressive doorman stared me down and stood by me for a tip when i told him i didnt need his help carrying my one luggage and hailing down several parked outside and waiting taxi  hot and muggy weather  paper thin walls you can hear neighbors closing luggage  room service trash left in hallway   montreal taxi drivers dont like to use air conditioning even though it hot and humid  tv blurry  windows dirty with spider web action outside  i brought my own shower head but the one i removed from the hotel was full of nasty gunk  ac sound like a truck releasing its air brakes ever y ten minutes  house keeping called me  times in as many hours regarding my do not distrub sign while i was sleeping  thanks for not disturbing me sarcasm  dusty tv screen and desk  hospital room like feel  location is way out of the way from the good parts of downtown and the green line metro  tv is vintage and takes forever to change channel manually  cost  each way from the train station in taxi  In conclusion I believe youd be better off staying at a motel or super hotel  The best  star hotel on priceline is the Omni  
P => Would go back in a heartbeat Situated between Old Montreal and downtown this hotel was a perfect location for sightseeing and shopping  The staff person at the desk was very helpful as we got to Montreal at  in the morning and they even upgraded our room to a King size bed The room itself was absolutely perfect the bathroom spotless and in excellent repair  It had a ble shower as well as a bathtuband it was all as clean as clean is possible  Even though it was a smoking room you could not smell any hint of cigarettes and it was not stale from any artificial fragrance either  fyi the internet usage in the business center is  per half hour and the parking is  for the day but dont drive in the city because the parking meters are even more expensive and good luck finding parking  Take the metro and buy yourself a day pass    its well worth the money  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would go back in a heartbeat  
P => Nice Hotel I booked this hotel on Hotwire for the th of y weekend which was also the same time as the Montreal Jazz Festival  The location of the hotel is great  It is within walking distance of Old Montreal  There is also a shopping center under the hotel but it seemed to close rather early The room is spacious and the bathroom includes a arate tub and shower  Service was fine once I got there  However I e mailed the hotel ahead of time to add my Priority Club number and room preferences and never got a response  My preferences did seem to be noted however and I received the type of room I wanted at check in The room includes a coffee maker but unlike most hotels where I have stayed you have to pay extra if you want tea  The coffee maker is located in the bathroom with one bag of coffee and a note stating that if you want more coffee or if you want tea you can purchase it from the minibar  I thought it was very petty to make guests pay for a tea bag  This is just one example but as other guests have mentioned the hotel seems to charge for pretty much everything The room service menu was very expensive and did not offer a lot of good options The room and common areas are well appointed and very clean  It is a very nice hotel but just be aware that everything is an extra charge  
P => Good Hotel but Out of the Way We stayed at this hotel for a bachelors party  There were about  of us that stayed in various floors throughout the building  I got this off Hotwire for nt double beds  The beds were quite comfortable rooms were average size  Hotel reception was very friendly and helped cater to your needs although were young so we dont really complain about services  The bathroom was cool in that it had a arate showerbath tub  The place was clean and the AC kept the room very comfortable  My gripes are that there is not  vending machine in the building and no open convenience stores nearby  So at am after the clubs and drinking you have no choice but to open the  Fiji water or get room service  The Hotel is also a bit far from shopsrestaurantsdowntown although there are  fancy places to eat across the street  Old Montreal is close but still a good   min walk to get there  Internet was  per day which I found rather absurd in this day of technology  Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay again  
P => Great Location Got a deal via priceline for about  a night so stayed here for  nights  Great central location  Not many amenities in the hotel   small lap pool with no shallow end   ok for kids   No kids activities  We had brunch at the hotel   food was ok but not as nice as other   for the price  Ate lunch and dinner out at other restaurants Dissapointed that they charged us for using coffee service in room   should be complementary each day not just one time They charged us for tea and a chocolate bar  We dont drink tea and my two boys are allergic to chocolate  Argued a bit with the charge but they  insisted  that we must have eaten them because the inventory      blah blah  Wont go back unless get priceline again  
P => good location great hotel this is a very nice hotel on the edge of old Montreal  its about a  cab ride up to the plateau where the quotrealquot montrealers live rooms were big amp nice amp spotless  we had a good view of the park and downtown on a high floor despite booking on priceline we enjoyed the tiny indoor pool and attached terrace The service was great  valet parking was  thats the only downside  there are garages further down Rue Antoine that are half the price  i was lazy though and paid valet we walked to old montreal for breakfast every day and rented bikes and did the loop around the lachine canel  great hotel great location great city 
P => Good way to finish a trip Booked via Priceline  AI This is not the first time we stayed here  And I was pleased to find out when I won my bid The hotel is well located re downtown and old Montreal  For a cyclist this is a good spot to start exploring the citys paths  The rooms are stylish and romantic with sumptuous beds spacious bathroom and bathrobe although the view from the window was not the best  The lobby is stylish  attached to the Centre de Commerce International  Weekday and Saturday just walk down to the food courts if you want to avoid the pricey restaurant  The pool is smallish but lengthwise provides good swimming  Good gym too  
P => Spotless I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the InterContinental  There wasnt a hint of staleness in my room it always smelled quotfreshquot  The bedding was lovely the bathroom was spacious  I would certainly recommend this hotel  One aside  Youll need to take the subway or a cab to get around the city  Old Montreal and Chinatown are both within walking distance of the hotel other points of interest need the easily maneuverable metro system  
P => Simply perfect I love this hotel       the staff is great location is flawless rooms are divine     I will be back  
P => Great low season deal I found an incredible deal on a room at the Inter Continental through Hotwire and booked it as a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend  The staff were uniformly friendly  professional and engaging and the room was as expected for a  star hotel  The location is really convenient a subway stop and all local amenities are within easy walking distance even in Montreals uary cold  brrr  The room we were given was in the th floor and looked like it could do with a bit of a reation there were some corners where wallpaper had started to peel away from the wall and some of the furnishings looked a little faded  The gym was great it was filled with old school fixed weight systems which allowed you to work specific muscle groups  They were really sturdy and of good quality even if they werent the latest  There were also of course the usual electronic elliptical trainers as well  I didnt get a chance to use the pool as it was closed for the evening when we arrived  Overall I would love to return especially during off peak seasons and definitely if there was another deal on Hotwire  
P => A wonderful hotel in old Montreal An excellent location for walking and touring Old Montreal  I booked on priority points and was given a great room overlooking the river and Habitat The concierge and front desk were most helpful  It is a wecloming place with excellent service and quality  Would highly recommend it  You  walk the area or take the Metro to any other area of Montreal you might want to visit  I took the train in from Dorval near airport and walked from the commuter train stop to the hotel  This is about a mile but the day was beautiful The lunch restaurant Gourmand and Olives was a neat bistro with many local people  The dinner restaurant Chasse et Peche was recommended to me by a chef I knew but the hotel confirmed it was excellent and it was This is a place to be  
P => Hard to go wrong I bid on and won this hotel on Priceline   It must be new because the place is flawless  It is absurd they wanted to charge me  for a roll away  The location the soaps sheets larger rooms wide halls  Id not understand why this hotel is not higher rated  From what I saw it would be hard to beat  
P => Great weekend getaway Booked this hotel through Priceline and got a great deal  For a few bucks more than the one star hotels with the dirty carpets we stayed in the Intercontinentals beautiful well appointed comfortable room on the rd floor with a beautiful view of the park Mont Royal and the city  It is a pleasure to stay here I dont want to leave 
P => nice hotel Stayed for  nights on a business trip  Nice room with a good view of a bridge very comfortable bed  What got me was a little sign in the beautifully appointed bathroom that you would be charged an extra  US if you made a second pot of the little Mr  coffee maker in the bathroom  Struck me as a little less than  star Hotel more like a Red Roof Inn  The hotel is connected to the underground  Many restaurants within walking distance but if you go in the winter bring good boots  The morning buffet in the Hotel was   US per person  I would love to go back to Montreal in the warmer weather A beautiful city to explore  
P => Pleasant Nights Stay Stayed one night and because of the freezing rain we ided to park our car underground using the valet service that way we could leave it till  pm the next day without paying  twice instead it was a total      valet service was prompt and courteous  We had breakfast at the Plaza McGill which was good and not too expensive located west of the hotel then turn left and walk down two blocks  The room had two comfortable chairs to watch TV and the bed was also very nice  We reserved through Priceline  
P => Good Stay Always wanted to stay at an Intercontinental  It was a typical  star hotel  Didnt like that during the cold season it is a bit of a walk to St  Catherine street  You can take the metro but they blast the heat down there   its unbearable  Youre better off cabbing it  The comforter was wonderful   fluffy down  Pool was perfect for the kids  The bar has the best onion soup ever Youre only bet for coffee from Monday evening Monday early a m  is in the hotel but its   During workweek hours theres an underground mall attached and its a bit cheaper down there  There was broken glass by the bed and my son stepped on it  The head of housekeeping came up and gave us a bandaid and some ointment and had it vacuumed  I would stay again if the weather was a bit milder but in the cold Id select something more centrally located  better yet I wont be back until its milder We froze our butts off 
P => the best hotel beds we have ever slept on I got this hotel on priceline for  rooms at  each a night There were  of us adults so I had called ahead to request  double non smoking rooms and when we got there that is what we were given I asked if the rooms were next to each other and was told that was only possible if we had king beds so we said quotok no problemquot but she moved us up  floors so that our rooms were only  rooms apartThis gave both rooms a great view of the snow covered city and rooftops including the river and Biosphere The rooms themselves were perfect very large big bathrooms with erate showers and tub  Bathrobes and slippers were provided and the double beds were large enough for my parents to share After a few nights someone mentioned quoti think this is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept inquot and the other  of us all agreed The pillows were not as nice as the Conrad in Istanbul the best pillows we have ever had but the beds were amazingThe gym amp pool was closed on christmas day we stayed from the th th and had limited hours the next day but were open at am on the th  I even brought in my  year old cousin who lives in Montreal and we had a wonderful time at the pool The staff was very nice and did everything to make our stay perfect we were never treated differently for using priceline  We even added an extra night using priceline  wasnt possible but we got the rooms for  which is still a great deal The hotel told us that they will be reating soon to compete with the  star hotels downtown but we found this hotel to be perfect alreadyThe only thing I would warn about would be that parking is  a day includes valet but you can park on the street for much less if you plan to use your car during most of the daytime 
P => Extra Bed Charge is Absurd I have stayed at the Intercontinental in Montreal several times over the years and have always had a pleasant stay  Booked through Hotwire on this stay arrived at pm with my son and were told there were no rooms with two beds available  So they put us in a king bedded room and we were forced to pay  for the rollaway bed  While I understand that the hotel cannot guarantee specific room configurations I dont feel it is fair or appropriate to be charged excessively for an extra bed when there are only two people in the room in the first place and the hotel cant provide a room with two beds  I did talk to the front office manager about it after our stay and although he was pleasant and professional his explanation was that it was a labor charge  I find it very hard to believe that it cost  to have a staff member bring the bed in and out of the room  More importantly it was the first time I can ever remember being charged for an extra bed  Other than that the hotel was comfortable although after  years soon in need of freshening and updating  Unlikely to return if only because of the extra bed charge  
P => Great Hotel Intercontinental Montreal Stayed at the Hotel for  nights on business in ember and on arriving at the Hotel reception I was given an upgrade to a Business Suite as I was a regular user of the Hotel chain  Beautiful large room with double aspect windows looking over the city  Used the facilities including the Gym and Pool which were very nice and the staff were very accommodating  Will always use the Hotel when in Montreal on business if the standards stay as good as they are  
P => missing the je ne sais quoi of other intercontinentals I have mixed feelings about this hotel  On the one hand it is nicely located for business at the Palais des Congress has a helpful and friendly staff and is comfortable  On the other hand there were many small details that when put together made this a rather disappointing Intercontinental experience  I was surprised and disappointed that this Intercontinental was not at the standard of others where I have stayed such as the Intercontinental Amman  I will find another hotel next time I am in Montr al Like other reviewers I definitely felt quotnickled and dimedquot at this hotel  You are given only one small coffee packet in your room for free each night and each one after that costs   Hair Conditioner is not provided and the hotel charges for forgotten amenities such as toothpaste  These are things that other hotels of this class give away quotfor freequot without question  I dont really consider these items quotfreequot since they should be considered part of the money youre paying for the room  The wireless internet in the rooms was very expensive   hours and literally put up an annoying popup window that had to be dismissed every two minutes It also required me to re order it several times forcing me to call down twice to be certain my bill wasnt being charged multiple times  The room service was very delicious and quick to arrive but far more expensive than other places of this class  Also the rooms and the general design of the hotel are average at best  I expect a lot more from Intercontinental and was disappointed in the boring or and less than spotless cleanliness  The shower was NOT CLEAN  There was mold in the grouting and that is completely unnecessary for a shower that is obstensibly cleaned each and every day  The carpet was stained and the wallpaper in my bathroom was peeling  Also the television was small and outdated  I spent four nights in this hotel and got ill during my trip so I was in my room more than I intended and was really disappointed in the surroundings  that being said The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were soft and clean  I liked the towels too and the shower had good water pressure  The desk was comfortable to work at as well  The staff were friendly and efficient and I liked the pm checkout time very much  I think this hotel is perfectly acceptible but you can also do much better  It needs a makeover and a stylist updated or and a touch of class  even the W doesnt charge you if you want to brew more than one pot of coffee in your room Intercontinental can do a lot better than this 
P => excellent for a conference  business trip Excellent front desk service  Amazing view from the top if you get a window room  Great location for quotbusinessquot downtown offices conferences etc  A little far from quotfunquot downtown shopping tourists areas bars etc  Excellent rooms and the elevator is so fast I went from the th floor to the lobby in a blink  
P => Enjoyed by business stay Stayed at the hotel during my business trip and fully enjoyed the hotel  It was very easy to check in and out  It is within walking distance of Old Montreal and downtown  a couple of blocks from St  Catherine and Metro  The king bed was comfortable in corner spacious room  The housekeeping never was late and had everything impeccably prepared  The TV is small but the views were fantastic  th floor even with the construction on the East side  I checked out but kept my bags with the bellmen for a  a bag  It was very convenient  I would recommend a stay for any business traveler  
P => Intercontinental for an excellent weekend getaway This was our second long weekend at the Intercontinental this summer  This was over labor day weekend  We arrived very late Friday night and were immediately checked into our Ambassador upgrade which was a large corner club level room facing the St  Lawrence  It was a lovely quiet room  The club lounge breakfast had wonderful fruit and berries as usual as well as cereals breads and muffins  The afternoon service included wine and cheese and a small selection of hot and cold dishes  It was a relaxing break We utilized concierge services which were very helpful and valet services for our car also on point The area around the hotel has changed so much over the last few years and I find it much more in the center of things  I think that we are pretty demanding travelers who have enjoyed staying in some of the top hotels in the world and while the Intercontinental in Montreal is not in THAT category it is an excellent hotel in a wonderful area  
P => Had a great stay We stayed at the hotel for  nights and were very happy with our choice  We reserved a room with a king size bed and felt that the room was a good size everything was very clean and modern and it had a nice bathroom with a arate shower and bathtub  We were in room  and had a nice view of the harbour and a bit of downtown  I d caution anyone staying on this side of the building because they re in the process of building something across the street and as we were checking in a couple were complaining about the noise and asked to be moved  Luckily there wasn t any construction while we were there but hopefully being on the th floor we wouldn t have heard much  After over hearing the complaint we asked to be on a different side of the building which they couldn t accommodate but they did move us to a higher floor to hopefully escape any noise The location was nice as it s very close to Old Montreal but only a short walk to St  Catherine street I read a previous review that the person s room was charged for something that didn t apply to them  Our room was charged for a buffet breakfast that wasn t ours which they removed after confirming the mix up with the restaurant and we over heard another guest explaining that they hadn t taken anything out of the mini bar which had been charged to their room  A minor inconvenience but it seems to happen quite often at this hotelThe staff was very polite the room was very clean and spacious we liked the location and would definitely stay here again  Well worth the  we paid for a  star hotel  
P => Great Stay in montreal I stayed here with my wife and  year old son the hotel is located right beside Old Montreal like  meters away and also right by downtown for shopping and the best restaurants we walked the whole weekend the lobby is very nice but located on the second floor with an escalator this could be a problem with a baby stroller or people with disabilities we asked for another way down and they gave us a special key and a guided tour of how to use it   I was very impressed with the service we received I would recommend using the valet parking theres something about just dropping you car off at the front door and taking you belongings and thats it when you need you car again you call and its there  per day no limits in or out no hidden costs because ive heard about the hidden cost of self parking which is  and you cant leave or youll be charged another fee by the way the hotel doesnt run the parking lot The porter that helped us with are bags was very helpful and pleasant also the front staff was also good   so to sum it all up highly recommend hotel if you want cheap go to a cheap hotel this is a high class hotel for high class people Im not I just pretend on my holidays 
P => Pleased with the Experience Would recommend My wife and I traveled from Boston to Montreal for our  year anniversary and stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal  I booked the room using priceline and was pleased with the price  Id noticed the reviews here for the most part all agreed about the quality of the rooms but complaints when they came were directed at customer service and staff  We were pleased with the customer service and only a few minor points prevent me from giving our experience  stars We arrived just barely after  p m  check in time left our car parked out front in the  min unloading area and proceeded to the reception area  There were about  or  people waiting in line ahead of us but it moved rather quickly  Once up front we were informed that our request via email had been honored as we were upgraded to a corner room non smoking king size bed on the th floor  However the room was not ready just yet  I asked how long it would be a call was made but the answer was not clear right away  We were given  drink vouchers and told we could go to the bar and relax until the room was ready  So I complained none  We unloaded our bags to have them held for us until the room was ready and I parked the car in the garage beneath the hotel day  By the time I got back  mins perhaps our room was ready  We went ahead and used our free drink and let them hold the bags a little longer The room was great spacious well laid out nice large bathroom  One note I didnt see explained anywhere the TV volume is piped into the bathroom kind of neat  so there was a switch which said something about audio in the bathroom  It took me a couple of days to figure out what this was about and I only did because I moved the TV a bit and loosened the output cable which somehow caused the TV audio not to work anywhere as it was not completely detached  I couldnt figure it out right away and called to have someone come look at it  After about  minutes of waiting I gave it another good look and figured it out I didnt expect any audio out on this little TV and saw no speakers anywhere that the audio would be going to   so I called and let them know Id fixed it myself  Another negative note on the room there is a thermostat but as far as we could tell it did nothing  It remained  degrees the entire time   which is a comfortable temperature but Id like it just a bit cooler for sleeping after the first night I slept without any covers  We tried turning it all the way down and it did run all night but apparently just put out more  degree air  After the first night and it had not cooled down I made a call to have someone look at that  When we got back at the end of the day a bottle of evian had been left for us but the temperature remained the same I guess the water was to keep us cool  I ided it wasnt worth getting up in arms about as like I said it was quite comfortable so long as you didnt try to get under the covers  As far as this is concerned for the staff a note of some sort would have been nice or a voice message to explain someone had looked at it but they were unable to fix it because   Another positive on the customer service we were pleasantly surprised by some chocolate covered strawberries arriving at our room on our first night there  These came with a note welcoming us to montreal  The concierge was helpful to a point and gave us a recommendation and made reservations for a restaurant to celebrate our anniversary   Bonaparte which was quite good albeit occupied almost entirely by Americans as far as we could tell  We later asked about a restaurant called Savannah which had a positive review in our guidebook  The concierge didnt have a menu for them what we were actually looking for and couldnt tell us any more  On Sunday we got to the location and realized it no longer existed   perhaps why the concierge didnt have any idea about it   I imagine a really exceptional concierge would have been able to tell us that with a little phone bookinternet searching I was just a tad annoyed about the garage situation   I asked the bell hops about the costs they knew it was day but didnt seem to know exactly how it worked and if there was signage in the garage I missed it   they sort of told me that it really was unrelated to the hotel effectively but were saying the day was based on some time of day not on an actual  hr clock  i e  if I parked Thursday at  and got my car out on Saturday at  thus being parked for a total of  hours I might have been charged  rather than  due to being past some time  most other garages in the area charge something on the order of   for a half hour or  up to  hours or  for up to  hours and as such seem to actually work on the  hr clock  In retrospect Id recommend parking across the street in a day garage you unload your things at the curb anyway and the walk from that garage is probably about the same as the one which is directly beneath the hotel  Of course its only  per day so whatever  However it worked i did park my car Thursday at  and took it out Sunday morning meters dont charge on Sunday until  p m  and the total cost was   Ah before I forget while Im complaining about things I was disappointed in glancing through the welcome packet of stuff on the desk to see that there were prices shown for toiletry items you forgot  This is my first trip to Canada so I have no idea if this is more of a different country kind of thing  Its along the same lines as the internet  Why is it I can stay at a cheap holiday inn which offers free wireless internet and will give me a toothbrush if I need it but when you stay at a fancy   hotel the internet is day I forget the actual cost and a toothbrush will cost you   I remembered my essentials so it didnt really effect me would have loved free wifi thoughOh and another complaint I dont believe in short reviews   on Saturday my wife and I left our room at about  to meet friends for lunch  Id gone downstairs to get something from my car earlier and passed a housekeeper who asked if she could clean our room yet do not disturb sign was on   I told her no but wed be gone in an hour  We were only at lunch for an hour and a half or so and then came back to the room with our friends for just a minute  Our room had not been touched at that point  After about  minutes our friends left and we walked them out  When we returned to our room our dirty wine glasses from the night before had been removed replaced with clean ones nothing else done  We got ready to go back out and were gone another  minutes later and for the next several hours coming back around  and still nothing different to our room  I should definitely point out we took the do not disturb off of our door when we left at   Im not sure if the in and out was part of the problem or if there is a time after which housekeeping will no longer do anything but remember they came in and gave us new wine glasses but it seems there were definitely windows of opportunity there  We called before leaving for dinner and requested some fresh towels at least which were provided  Really not a huge complaint just one of those little things to keep it from being a perfect experience  The location of the hotel was quite good and we walked to most things and took the metro to a couple others  Hopefully the complaints of the email wont outweigh the postiives   as we were quite pleased with the experience and would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to friends but of course its sometimes easier to harp on the little nagging things than rave about the good things  hope this helps others    
P => Well Worth It  The location is just perfect the customer service is prime and if you book it via Priceline you will save a ton  A great stay even at full price highly recommended 
P => Great Convention Center Location I stayed at this property while attending a tradeshow  Great location to the convention center and I loved the little park in front of the hotel  nice to sit on the bench during breaks or eat lunch  There were several restaurants within walking distance and it was very close to Notre Dame and the Old City area  My room was in a corner and was very large I also had great views 
P => Hotel InterContinental  Great location My wife and I stayed at the Hotel InterContinental Montreal for our honeymoon  This hotel has a great location on the edge of Vieux Old Montreal across the street from the convention center  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very attentive to our needs  All hotel staff addressed you first in French followed by English giving you the option to respond in the language you preferred  Our room was beautiful we had a corner room with a good view of the city  There are no rooms below the th floor so everyone gets a great view  My wife found the bed very comfortable although I found it a bit stiff  The restaurants found in this hotel are very expensive although lower cost dining options are within a few minutes walk  There is a great breakfast restaurant called Nouveau Notre Dame on Rue Notre Dame you can have two full breakfasts for under  CAD  The only frustrating thing about this hotel is the fact it has a very small pool and lacks a whirlpool  The swimming pool is designed exclusively for lap swimming and should just be considered part of the gym not somewhere to relax  My wife and I do look forward to visiting this hotel again to quotrelivequot our honeymoon  
P => Excellent value and location We just spent for four nights and were quite pleased I received the hotel in response to Priceline bid but we were never treated with anything less than first class service and attention The check in staff were friendly and helpful actually switching me to a different room to allow a slightly early check in  Our th floor room was large and comfortable with an excellent view of the river and parts of Old Montreal There is an attached mall closes early however with a food court and restaurants  Its a short walk to the Notre Dame and basically anything in the old port  Towards downtown its a bit uphill but walkable to St Catherines Street and much shopping and entertainment  We found that much of what we wanted to see was very close and walkable from the hotel For the more distant sites we booked a Grey Line Tour through the concierge and visited the Olympic Stadium Botanical Gardens and the Mont Royal in a single day The hotel was an excellent value great location and friendly staffed  I would return anytime  
P => ent stay We spent one night at the Intercontinental in Montreal on our way to Quebec City from Toronto and at CAD per night we were pleased until we found out other travelers paid half as much Regardless of the room rate we found the room to be quite spacious big enough for a king sized bed sofa armoire and desk  We had a view of the hole next door where the new Westin is being built but thankfully we couldn t tell you if any construction went on during our stay because it was blissfully quiet  The bed was on the softer side not the best support for two people with back problems the linens were soft and the down comforter fluffy and light  The poorly lit bathroom was also large with a arate shower stall and bathtub  The grout in the corners of the bathroom probably could have used a good scrubbing and the showerhead needed to be alcified as the spray was a little wild the temperature and pressure was great though  The hotel was conveniently within walking distance to St  Catherine and across the street from Toque where we had dinner highly recommended  
P => Convenient and comfortable We stayed here from y th to th  Our standard room was spacious more than comfortable and clean  It wasnt quite luxurious but it had a wonderful bed in a nice updated and neutral or The bathroom was fine   lots of hot water and ent pressure The location was very convenient   it connects to the metro and is only a couple of blocks from Old Montreal There is shopping underground in the attached Montreal Trade Center   and a nice coffee shop that my husband got coffee pastries and yogurt from for our breakfast beats room serviceWe fould the concierge very helpful   they got us tickets to museum exhibits as well as a soccer game  One male concierge gave us incorrect instructions on which metro stop to use when finding Schwartzs deli  We ended up walking  blocks when we were already kind of beat but that seems a very minor complaint  
P => Lovely comfortable and convenient hotel We stayed at the InterContinental Montreal for  nights  The trip was for both business and pleasure  We booked through Priceline and ended up with one of the really inexpensive rates  They are one of the hotels who still takes your Priority number and gives you credit for the stay   even if you book through Priceline Expedia etc  I always appreciate that We arrived very late on a Friday night  My boyfriend had requested a room on a high floor  They originally had us booked into a room on the th floor but the front desk was very accommodating and moved us to   It is a corner room with views of the river and the city  The floor to ceiling window on the main wall is lovely  We looked at both rooms and I must say that the corner rooms are much larger than the traditional rooms and if you can get one   do The corner rooms have a small sofa that the other rooms dont have Big note On the side of the building where you have rooms     there is a GIANT construction project going on  They are building a W hotel next door  During our stay it was a big hole in the ground with giant crains moving metal poles  On both Saturday and Sunday there was ZERO noise from the site  They were doing small projects but we did not hear them  I would certainly take note of staying on that side during the week As previously reviewed the bathrooms are very spacious  The towels bathrobes and slippers are very nice  The toiletries provided were of a nice quality  They offer shampoo no conditioner soap gel and body lotion  There is an additional box with cotton bads hair bands shoe polisher etc The or is typical of the traditional style you would find at most Intercontinentals  The views are very nice and the curtains are the really good kind of black out curtains  You could sleep all day and never know the sun was out  The TV is small and you have to work at swiveling it to face the bed  Keep trying   it does turn all the way to face the bed   it just takes some effort  They do have several English stations including the major US networks out of Plattsburgh NY  NOTE It took us a while to find the in room safe  It is in the nightstand  It is free of charge and big enough to store a laptop The mini bar is well stocked but outrageously overpriced   even for a nice hotel  I travel a lot and it was most expensive I have seen  Example  for a  bottle of red wine a brand that normally costs   dollars for a full bottle in the U S  This is coming from someone who usually uses the mini bar  The hotel does not have a gift shop in it  There is a convenience store two short blocks away that has everything and is easily accessible with extended hours  The beds are on the soft side but comfortable  The only thing we found odd was the mattress pad it had plastic on one side   so it sounds like you are sleeping on garbage bags  It is easily removed if this bothers you The valet was pleasant speedy and helpful  There did appear to be many parking lots in the area that offered cheaper rates  They are a short walk from the hotel  The area seemed quite safe even late at night  We found the concierge to be extremely helpful  They indulged us with many restaurant ideas  A great plus it that they have a full book of all of the local menus  Their maps and directions were terrific  I know many people said they were unhappy with the customer service but I must say that this was not our experience  From the valet to the front desk to the concierge   everyone was very helpful The best part about the hotel is the location  It is a short walk from Old Montreal  There are many really great restaurants within walking distance  Everyone talks about Eggspectation that is around the block  The name might be corny but the breakfast is really good and it is a cute restaurant It is a   minute cab ride to the airport  The flat rate is    There are plenty of cabs in front of the hotel from early in the morning until late in the evening  
P => Great Location Won a three night stay at this hotel with a bid of  USD  The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to Old Montreal  Its a very short walk to the heart of OM  The rooms are what you would expect from a   hotel  On my next visit I will avoid the valet parking as there is plenty of parking nearby for much less than the valet rate All in all its a great hotel and the PL rate provided a steal of a deal I would stay here again  
P => Internet day Any hotel that would charge business travellers day for internet doesnt deserve our business  They also charged us for mini bar we didnt use 
P => Great time at the Intercontinental I stayed last weekend at the Intercontinental and had a wonderful time As to other peoples comments the staff was very pleasant and nothing extra was charged to my credit card in error  The room was very large and bathroom was completely luxorious It was almost the same size as my studio apartment in NYC My boyfriend also took advantage of the indoor pool which was very nice as well  The location of the hotel is great for sight seeing in old Montreal   it was about a block away from the Notre Dame and not that far from the main shopping area  Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend to all  
P => Rude Staff and Check Your Bill I am a regular traveller to Montreal and found the Intercontinental Hotel to be tired and the staff totally unprofessional and lacking in basic customer service skills  Also make sure you check your bill  When I stayed there with other business associates we all had errors in our bills which the staff disputed and charged to our credit cards after check out  There are plenty of other options in the city  
P => Terrific Stay We recently stayed at the Intercontinental on a cold Montreal weekend  However the hotel provided us with a warm and cozy experience  Based upon some recent comments and a previous stay there we were prepared for a nice hotel and bad service  We were wrong on the latter  The staff was warm gracious and efficient  Check in and check out took about  minutes in total  Our requests for a room with a king size bed and non smoking were honored  The room was spacious and the bathroom was immaculate and plush  The bed was extremely comfortable  The bar area was fun with good drinks and reasonable prices  Although we did not eat at the hotel we were offered a coupon for a   discount at dinner  The proximity to Old Montreal is great less than  minutes to St  Paul Street  Even the walk to the main shopping areas on Crescent Street took less than  minutes and with all the new underground connections you dont even have to go outside until you get there  And the Metro is accessible from the shopping mall that is adjacent to the hotel  These are nice touches on those cold Montreal days  Based upon our stay at the Intercontinental we will look for their specials for our future trips to Montreal  It appears that the management of the Intercontinental heard the complaints about service and ided to take them seriously  We had a wonderful stay  
P => fantastic place I was hesitant about staying here after reading some of the negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised upon arrival  I stayed there for a week for a conference and enjoyed every minute of my stay there  The room was nicely orated and the bed was comfortable  The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom and very luxurious  The major complaint that the staff was rude was not to be seen   they were very helpful and accomodating  The bar staff were very kind with directions and suggestions on places to see and eat at  Veronica was especially helpful  The main restaurant was as reported elsewhere expensive but the food was worth it  Its a great hotel in a great area  After staying in many hotels throughout the world this one is definitely in my top three and I would stay there again without hesitation  
P => great hotel for visting old montreal The Intercontinental is located at the edge of Old Montreal on a road which is easily accessible from expressways  It is a short walk to Old Montreal but you are not in the middle of all the noise and commotion that you get on weekends  Hotel is nicely furnished with excellent rooms  Food is excellent Sunday brunch is very nice  You can generally get a good nightly rate  Parking is pricey but you could use another garage nearby if you wish  
P => Ideal for a relaxing getaway I booked the Intercontinental on Priceline for  USD per night which is a steal given the location and lovely accomodations  If you prefer staying adjacent to Rue Saint Catherine or Rue Crescent then a more downtown hotel might be preferable  Walking to the above streets takes approximately   minutes while Vieux Montreal old montreal is a meager  minutes  Upon arrival the valet  CADnight was efficient and he sent our bags up to the room while we checked in  The check in was a bit slow but conducted in a friendly enough manner  The concierge was able to recommend a few nice restaurants in Vieux Montreal and she took the time to give us directions and a map  The room service was very quick both for a late night snack and for cafe au lait in the morning  The TV was programmed with a great deal of english speaking stations which was a nice surprise  pay per view movies are   CAD   hours of internet access either via hookup or through the TV is   CAD  We had a Deluxe room which I suspect is a bit larger than a standard and came with all of the expected amenities including a safe mini bar coffee maker hairdryer robes etc  The bathroom was VERY spacious even by american standards and done entirely in ble  I also liked the erate shower and bathtub  The room itself was pristine I am extremely critical regarding cleanliness of hotel rooms and the bed linens were crisp and comfortable  The mattress itself was rather firm but was covered in a featherbed which was a nice touch  While we dined mostly outside of the hotel we did have one meal at the hotel barpiano lounge Le Cristallin  The bartender was gracious and the food was surprisingly delicious with an elegant presentation  As a side note our favorite dinner occurred in Vieux Montreal at Mondavie a restaurant with live jazz and an extensive wine cellar  They offered a Table dHote  course prix fixe meal that was to die for at  CAD   highly recommend A cab ride to the Casino Montreal costs roughly  CAD and the Casino should not be missed It is non smoking and is elegant    I had a fantastic time despite being a non gambler and normally disliking casinos  In conclusion I would certainly return to the Intercontinental and would encourage others to stay especially for a discounted rate  
P => Nice hotel staff a little sub par good location  I stayed at the InterContinental two nights to participate in a athon in Montreal  The location is in the business center and around the corner from the W  Down the hill from the main shoppingnightlife strip  The hotel is adjacentconnected to a mini indoor mall closed on weekends and Metro station  I liked the accomodations including the lobby and spacious rooms excellent size bathroom  My room was corner room and only defect was a burnt out bulb in the bathromo   it was an otherwise perfect room  Bedmattress was extremely comfortable Some things I dislike   charge for Internet access average for   hotels and the staff  The front desk did not have urgency while seeing customers wait online and concierge was simply awful I waited   minutes while a conceierge women was on the phone and walked away  Later a different gentleman couldnt find a roadmap to assist me with directions  If they could improve some of their staff   I would say this is an EXCELLENT location but Id rather stay at a few other hotels in Montreal because they seem to care about their guest  
P => Good Accommodation and Convenience We stayed at this hotel during the recent Thanksgiving weekend     We selected this hotel because of its walking convenience to the old city about  minutes as well as to the downtown shopping district about  minutes  It was also easy to find for someone not familiar with this city  The hotel room was nicely furnished clean quiet and the king sized bed was quite comfortable  The desk service was prompt but not overly friendly while the concierge was quite helpful regarding directions and planning  The parking garage was under the hotel and you can park your own car there and save the valet fee  Directly connected to the hotel is a small covered shopping and office area with a bureau de change and some small restaurants one of which had excellent coffee and pastry for a quick breakfast  We would definitely choose this hotel again when we return to Monreal  
P => nice hotel    service needs some polish Intercontinental is the top hotel brand in the hotel company that includes the Holiday Inn Chain  I would expect the level of service to be at the same level of the other top hotel brands in other chains    Ritz Carlton St Regis Conrad  I found the service at this hotel below that level  It started when I arrived and there was nobody out front to assist with the car and the luggage  This is a hotel in an urban location with nowhere immediately in front to leave the car for any length of time   especially considering that the front desk for the hotel is not just inside the door but up on the second floor  I had to go inside the hotel to find someone to assist me  Once I had checked in and gone to my room it took over a half hour for my luggage to arrive in my room  Later in my stay I took postcards down to the front desk to be mailed  Instead of the front desk clerk who was not busy at the time just taking them and seeing they got to the right place told me i had to go across the lobby and ring the bell at the conceirge desk and wait for her to help me  Its a little thing but making the guest do all of the work is not providing good customer service in any business    certianly not one at this level  Service at breakfast in the restaurant was very sad  Normally I dont do breakfast buffets but it was included in the package at the rate I booked  So put the coupon on the table and went to serve myself  There appeared to be an omlette station set up but nobody was staffing it during the entire time i was in the restaurant  I returned to the table and still there was no sign of the server  I had been seated at a table with my back to the entire restaurant so it wasnt easy to spot a server   which actually isnt my job its the servers job to spot me  The server appeared at my table only once and that was to ask if I wanted coffee  When I told her quotno thanksquot i never saw her again  I got tired of waiting for her to bring me a check so I just left the breakfast coupon on the table and left  Although I had complimentary breakfast the rest of my stay I did not return Service at Dinner in the restaurant was the only bright spot at this hotel  Both nights I was waited on by Jean Francois who was very knowledgeable and attentive  He has been a server there for  years and made for two very enjoyable dinners  Dinner hit all the right service points from the amuse bouche all the way through to the little mini creme brulee with the check  All of the dishes I ordered tasted great and had nice presentations  The building has a small footprint and is connected to other buildings by a tall thin atrium  Rooms are all above the th floor  My room was on the nd floor and although it was immediately off the elevator area I never heard the elevators quotpingquot nor did I hear any activity in the hallway My room  was nicely appointed and had a large window with a nice view of eastern Montreal and a partial view of the river  The bathroom had a arate corner shower and a tub as well  The bed was very comfortable and the bath had very large soft towels  I didnt see anything wrong with my room except that the desk faced the wall putting my back to the room and the view out the window  I move desks around a lot in hotel rooms to I can work on the computer and not stare at the wall  Its a very nice hotel in a good location but for a hotel of their class and room rate they need to polish up their service skills of their associates  
P => Disappointed with the service at the InterContinental We went to Montreal for a quick one night get away without the kids  The reception desk performance was sub par  I had to wait and listen to four representatives argue with an unhappy customer for about  minutes  During check out the staff was overwhelmed with six customers and I left after  minutes with no movement in the line  The hotel is in a great location we walked to great restaurants and attractions  The room was small but comfortable with a great view  The dry bar items for sale had an opened and eaten item that had must have been missed by the maid  The bed was very comfortable  The bathroom was nicely laid out and furnished however mold and mildewed grout black spots in the shower and a cracked sink are unacceptable  We will try another hotel next time 
P => Fabulous property with lovely quiet rooms My partner and I departed the Loews Hotel Vogue which many reviewers seem to prefer because the hotel sits in the bar district and has single paned windows  Management acknowledges the problem and an upgrade next year  Guests are now treated to yelling singing etc  at closing time     a m  apparently on weekends We moved to the Intercontinental based upon travel guide reviews and also those of our friends who are native to the city  What a great hotel Rooms are lovely and large and especially quiet  By calling the hotel we received a special package including a high floor room with view and full American breakfast buffet for  CAD less than the Vogue It is true the Vogue is charming but if you want it all    service location and quiet the Intercontinental is the way to goWe would stay there again 
P => Top Shelf with a Low Price I recently spent  nights at the InterContinental Montreal over Columbus DayCanadian Thanksgiving Week End and I was very inpressed for the price CA AAA Rate The locate is perfect to explore Old Montreal  It is in the Financial District so it is quiet on the week end  Its a minor walk to St Catherines St  as well  The elevators are super fast  The rooms are very upscale with Crown Molding but the bathroom is superb  erate bath and shower  My wife loved that  We had a great city view with the park below  The hotel is so quiet  You will not have trouble sleeping but you will need to enjoy feather beds duvet and pillows  We had a mini party in our roon but you could not hear us at all in the hall  The front desk staff was very nice and helpful  The lap pool is very nice but there was a bunch of construction stuff on the outdoor k  I believe they were doing some work to the hotel My only draw back is that the maid did not vaccum for the  days were were there  The bath and beds were well taken care of but I like a nice clean carpet ever day  Not sure if I would say  Star but  and a half  This was our th trip to Montreal and we will be back to the IC for sure  
P => Nice Hotel   Poor Service I stayed at the Intercontinental for a week at the end of tember  while attending a conference at the Palais De Congress Across the street  I have a mixed review of this hotel  The room facility healthclub were all very nice  My reservation about this hotel was in regards to my reservation  I had called to make the reservation months ahead of time  There was a conference rate and it was reasonable  I reserved a NON SMOKING room  Upon arriving around  pm the night of my reservation I was given room   Twentieth floor nice view nice amenities  But it was a smoking room and reeked of stale cigarettes  Upon returning to the desk to ask for a room change I was bruskly told   quotWe are fully booked tonight and we do not garuntee non smoking rooms quot WHAT What was the point of making a reservation months in advance I was given no sympathy and no options other than changing rooms the next morning  They offered to open a window for me  Thats all  As it was late and I figured all the area hotels were booked because of the conference I was attending I stayed in that room for the night  Nothing like having stale smoke in your bed when you lay your head down at night and in the morning I reeked  When I went down the next morning the new desk staff were not eager to change my room  I had to insist  They offered no amends for the error  When I got a new room on a non smoking floor it was nice and I was fine with it and the housekeeping service  But be aware that the front desk and concierge staff are a cold bunch  
P =>  star sorta This trip was a getaway from the normal hectic life of nyc so we ided to book a last minute wknd trip to montreal  Overall the hotel is nice its got a nice lobby room is ok  Staff is alright nothing too great  this is definitely a business style hotel nothing really romantic about it you are right by old montreal so thats nice  
P => Nice but not  stars The InterContinental hotel is a nice place to stay with a great location especially if you are attending a meeting at the convention center which is right across the street  The room my husband and I had was spacious with a nice comfy bed  The bathroom was also spacious with a arate shower and bath  Robes were provided which is always a plus  The staff were friendly enough we had no problems there  The food was average but overpriced  The reason I think this hotel does not live up to its  star rating is that they charge for every extra tea in the room internet access  The pool is very small but the remainder of the spa amenities including the massage and sauna were nice  Overall I would stay here again but wouldnt pay full price  Try to find a deal check Montreals official tourism website or Priceline  
P => A Great Stay at the IC M I stayed here for  nights at the end of ust and enjoyed my stay  I had a great rate on Priceline     a night with the usual fees etc  bringing it up to about   The room        appeared to be one of the smaller rooms on the floor but it was fine for me  Very nice view to the southeast the river and the island and hills on the horizon  The bed was enormous and very comfortable there was a good desk space and the armchair was one of the best I have ever sat in  The bathroom is large and well laid out with good quality toiletries    The White Company London and Green Tea  The cleaning staff are terrific  I especially appreciated having the room made up before I returned early in the afternoon for a nap each day  There are two high speed cable internet options    a daily rate of   and a weekly rate of   for unlimited use  I chose the latter  The connecting cord snakes through the lamp on the desk along with a telephone connection in case you want to use a telephone modem though with hotel phone rates what they are I cannot imagine anyone with a modern computer wanting to do that  Two small downsides neither major   There was no room ready when I arrived at around  am and so left the luggage with the bellmen at the entrance  The woman at the reception desk was efficient but not very friendly  But I returned when she suggested and got the room I was so happy with and she warmed up as the week went on   I had a drink and a not very interesting pasta light meal in the bar off the lobby which were predictably overpriced  I would not recommend the food there The comments of other posters about location are true  The metro stations are a bit of a hike but not a problem  The Metro has a  day pass for  well worth it  There is a weekly pass but it runs from Monday to Sunday and is not date flexible for just a little bit more  I got it for the second half of my stay and gave it to a friend when I left  The quotunderground cityquot tunnels are accessible without going outside which I imagine would be helpful in the wintertime  I did not have the hotel breakfast but then I almost never do anywhere  Eggspectations is as good as everyone says it is Restaurant recommendation Brunoise  St  Andre  Terrific nouvelle style cuisine very inventive mixture of flavors I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone if you can get a good price  
P => Nice hotel awkward location Spent three nights at this hotel over the  Labour Day weekend at a great rate from Priceline  Hotel was well appointed clean and equipped with all the modern conveniences  The bathroom was especially nice with a arate shower stall and bathtub  King size bed sported a a very nice duvet but was somewhat lumpy and uncomfortable to sleep in  Interesting location in Montreals recently redeveloped financial district  However the hotel is not particularly convenient to Montreals attractions unless you have business at the convention centre or will be spending your entire visit in Old Montreal  Staff was very friendly and attentive  The hotel sits adjoined with some older buildings connected by a spectacular glass atrium within which stands a peice of the Berlin Wall  A good find if you can get a good price  I find Montreal lacks quality hotels in the mid range as most of the citys choices are either very high end or old and somewhat run down so this was a refreshing change  
P => Great Hotel This was our third time in Montreal and our first time at the Intercontinental  It was a very nice hotel  Check in was easy and it was easy to find  We valet parked our car to the tune of  a day but that was easy and efficient We were on the  floor and our room was bigger than average  The bed was great and the bathroom had a stand up shower and a bathtub I didnt eat at the restaurant  I did have drinks at the lobby bar and a bar called Chez Plume by the conference rooms  Both were comfortable places and excellent service Previous posters had talked about the breakfast being too expensive in the hotel  I wouldnt eat breakfast at four star hotel and there are some alternatives very close by  One is a little counter in the quotcourtyardquot connected to the hotel on the bottom floor  It looks similar to a food court  You can get bagels and coffee  Another place on the way to Old Montreal is Eggspectations which is a great place to get breakfast  Also previous posters seem to disagree on if this hotel is in a good location  In my opinion it is easy to get to Old Montreal but not so easy to get to the nightlife at Catherine and Crescent  It is close to two metro stops so that really helps to get around  But don t expect to walk out your hotel and find bars and the nightlife right out your door it s a couple of blocks over I would also be remiss if I didn t mention the coolest fountain across from the hotel  It incorporates fire at certain times during the evening  Great fun 
P => Great spot in downtown I was out there on business  I had a great  night stay no complaints  Nice clean work out facility big bathroom with shower stall and bath tub  Most comfortable King size bed Id slept in  There wasnt a great view from the window but wasnt there for the view  It was in walking distance to downtown shopping places etc  And if your into famous rock stars it is located right next too St  James Hotel which is known to have celbs stay there  We actually saw iah Carey when we were there she was playing a concert in Montreal  Id def  stay there again  
P => Very nice hotel in a nice location Very much enjoyed my stay at the Intercontinental  First off the immediate surroundings are quiet so youll get a good nights sleep but its a nice part of town close to the Old City and Downtown a Metro station amp good restaurants not to mention that the lobby of the RBC building right behind it conveniently housing a late night ATM is a sight to behold in its own right  We didnt use any special services the hotel had on offer such as the concierge bellhop restaurant etc though service overall was friendly and accomodating  Do watch out for the incidental theyre plentiful  Local phone calls were a   each which was something new to me  The exercise room and pool were mediocre  The bathroom was however nice and big all ble inside with a arate shower and tub and the beds were extraordinarily comfortable  Although its apparent the hotel hasnt been recently redone usually something I usually go for the overall quality of the building and furniture were a few notches above the norm  Impeccably clean throughout  highly recommended 
P => Great choice We stayed at the Intercontential for two nights in late y   Pros Great location easy access to the Metro and a pleasant walk into the heart of old Montreal  Our hotel package included breakfast both days and it was a delicious buffet wtih an attentive service staff  The th floor pool with patio was a nice spot to catch the late afternoon sun  Room accommodations were lovely  Seemed that business and family travelers intermingled easily Cons The concierge seemed a bit swamped at times but with patience you could get some good tips on dining and sightseeing Without a doubt we would stay here again  
P => Solid Hotel My partner and I stayed at this hotel for  nights at the end of y and beginning of ust of   This was a great room with lots of extra space on the th floor and a small sofa good sized desk  tall ceilings and comfy lounging chair  One of the best sized rooms Ive stayed in Montreal  The or was nice not as stylish as say a W or the Le St Germain but consistent  We were on a club room floor and the breakfast though just continental was a nice treat given the high exchange rate and saved us prob  day for breakfast  The afternoon snack was also a nice touch  The towels are big and soft and the bed though a tad soft was very comfy  The location is excellent you can get to all parts of the city and Old Montreal is right out the back door   it might take a minute walk to get to the area by the Basillca and ten to the plaza but it is quick  The Victoria metro stop is right attached tot he hotel via the enclosed atrium or just a short walk outside  Popressa one block away is a quick little healthyinexpensive make your own pasta dish place  Major complaints were an odd odor in the Lobby like someone had used a drity mop to clean the floor odors in the hallways near our roomnot enough to deter another stay and the snacks at the afternoon snack time went very quickly and it took one guest to get the manager up here to keep it replenished with cheeses and crackers until pm  All in all I would have been nice if the club room was open all day cosidering how much of an upcharge the do for the room  But considering that at the time other hotels I had stayed at were charging anywhere from  more per night  We thought it was a great choice  
P => Highly recommend the InterContinental Montreal My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a last minute romantic getaway and we were very pleased  The service at this hotel is excellent  All of the hotel staff including the reception desk concierge housekeeping bartenders waiters and doormen were very friendly pleasant and polite  Everyone greets you with a smile and a  bonjour  when you walk by  Catherine at the concierge desk helped us plan our daily activities by making recommendations and booking reservations for us  She always had a smile on her face  We dont know what we would have done without her We booked a standard room with a king size bed  The room was extremely comfortable and a lot larger than we expected  It had a small foyer area and closet when you walk in so you dont walk right into the bed like you do at most hotels  We had a small sitting area with a chaise lounge and a big comfy chair in front of the armoire that housed the TV  There was also a desk and chair for business travelers a bench in front of the bed and  phones one on each side of the bed and the third in the bathroom  The bathroom had ble flooring and countertop  The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable The hotel is conveniently located in Old Montreal and is within blocks of the main attractions Notre Dame Basilica Old Port Crescent Street and downtown We highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Montreal  This is definitely where we will stay the next time we re in town  
P => Excellent in every way that matters Stayed here for  nights in y   The location is fine not anything more than office buildings outside the door area was deserted at night but felt safe  A   minute walk takes you to the old city or St  Catherine St  where you have the typical tourist selections  Taxi layover is right in front of hotel  Check in was quick there was only one clerk working and was checking someone in  I was the only person waiting but when a second person walked up the clerk immediately called someone else over to help  I had a quotdeluxequot room no view but large clean and fully stocked with all the requisites coffee maker iron etc  The bathroom was large with ble tiles and plenty of towels even a speaker so you could hear the TV  The concierge was available from  am pm  Airconditioning was fine and the room was quiet even though the room next to me was occupied with a young child  Make sure you check out the fountain in front of the hotel  There is actually a ring of fire in the fountain that goes off at night  Check the description of the fountain at the northwest edge of the park if you see the French description walk around to the other side of the pole for English which includes the times the ring of fire appears All in all a great experience  
P => Outstanding Hotel This place is excellent I am well travelled and this Intercontinental really impressed me  Certainly not the cheapest hotel in town but a bargain for the quality of the room and the service  Everyone here has an excellent attitude  Very good gym pool two restaurants and a bar  Little park right out front  On the edge of Old Montreal but with the Square Victoria merto stop connected directly to the hotel through a shopping arcade very handy in winter Id guess  Only negative very small lobby  No biggie for me  This place is superb  better than many a Ritz Carlton Ive stayed at  and not nearly as expensive  You cant go wrong here  
P => Tasteful and attractive hotel Very nice hotel on the edge of Old Montreal  Public spaces are attractive and tastefully done and rooms were probably a touch nicer than the standard business hotel in the area  Comfy beds large bathrooms and nice fixtures throughout the room  Shower pressure was surprisingly erratic  However Ive found many other Montreal hotels to be slightly dingy and didnt feel that way about this hotel at all   it was very clean and everything felt new and modern Higher floors seem to be the quotdeluxequot rooms while the lower floors seem to be the quotsuperiorquot   other than the view theres no apparent difference between them  My first room   a lower floor superior   had an awful view and smelled like smoke  My second room   a deluxe on a higher floor   had a wonderful view of the river  The view is worth the extra  The hotel is also connected to an attractive indoor mall  shopping area that seems to be shared by adjacent buildings  However it seems to be shut down on the weekends or at least it seemed like it when I was there Note that this hotel isnt in the heart of Old Montreal like a few other of the hotels  be  Its on the outskirts and is really in whats now being called the quotInternational Districtquot  Its not a far walk but if youre looking to walk out of your hotel into the heart of the old city this isnt it  I received a rate of  for a Thursday night and  for a Friday   both in CAD  Thats a pretty rekable rate given the competitions prices and the quality of the hotel  On balance next time Im in the area Id certainly stay here again and do recommend it  
P => Excellent room Stayed in one of their business rooms  very spaciuos and comfortable has hispeed internet at CAD per hrs  Bed above average and comfortable  staff friendly and helpful  Taxi fare from Trudeu airport CAD Shopping area about min walk away located nearer the old town though  Definatley stay again  
P => Intercontinental was great I stayed at this hotel il    and had a great experience  I was attending a conference across the street so it was conveniently located and had access to the underground at the back of the hotel which was especially good when it rained  Its on the fringe of Old Montreal which was another plus  The hotel staff including the concerige were very pleasant and helpful  I was upgraded upon check in and had a room on the th floor  The room was large as was the bathroom although the shower stall was tiny  The bed was extremely comfortable nice linens lots of pillows  Bathrobes were provided and the toiletries were plentiful  It was nice to know that the front desk would do a currency exchange without charging extra  The bar off the lobby was very comfortable  I ordered a specialty coffee drink that they were unfamiliar with but they were willing to try it and it turned out better than Ive had before  There is a pub restaurant across the back walkway that is part of the hotel and is very good too  This hotel is part of the Montreal World Trade Center complex which is accessable out the back where you can find shops and restaurants including a convenience store coffee counter and food court  I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again  
P => Sleep well in Montreal Spent a week staying at the Intercontinental as I was at a conference in the Convention Centre opposite  As I was staying for an extended period I was given a free upgrade to a deluxe room which was delightful  One of the most comfortable beds Ive ever slept in with wonderful soft mattress topper Im going to look for one for my bed at home great fluffy meringues of duvets and crisp linen  I dont think Ive ever slept better  Room was very large with lots of hanging and drawer space and a very comfortable easy chair with a good reading light next to it  The staff were all very friendly and helpful  As mentioned by other reviews the hotel is well located between the old town and the newer shopping areas  But dont be like me and walk around for days not realizing that there are all these shops underground Extra bonus for gourmets   the outstanding Toque restaurant is just opposite the hotel  Had a wonderful meal there  
P => Had a Very Nice Stay We stayed at the the Intercontinental Montreal from  to  on a short weekend getaway  The hotel was great  The location was good and we were treated very well even though we were Priceline customers  They offered us an upgrade for   Cdn  which gave us a room with a slightly better view and a bigger bathroom but the first room they offered us was perfectly fine  The concierge and the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful  We took subways all around the city of Montreal  The subway system is not that big and within two days we were familiar with it  We were not impressed with the Old City probably because it was off season  Also at least in winter months some tourist venues such as the Botanical Garden and Contemporary Art Museum  be closed Monday  We ate at La Petite Ardoise on Laurier Street a brasserie type restaurant Outremontand had a reasonably priced dinner  The menu is somewhat small but the french style food is good   better than what we had in the Old Town  We also ate at the Intercontinental before flying home and the food was very good  All in all I would recommend the Intercontinental Montreal  
P => Great stay at the Intercontinental This hotel is beautiful conveniently located and very very clean  The bedding has been upgraded throughout the hotel in a comforter style with very soft sheets and the cleanliness of the room was above average  We stayed down the street at W our last trip and there was no comparison  The hotel is right at the edge of the old city which was very easily accessed out back  The concierge the front desk and even the doorman were very knowledgable of the local area  They were helpful and very pleasant  Again they beat the W in this department  The restaurants that they recommended were very nice  especially Buonaparte and they always had maps handy for directions  The convention centre is right across the street and there is shopping within ten minutes walking  Over all a great hotel 
P => Old Favorite Still Great We have visited Montreal for Christmas several times  We always stay the the InterContinental  They have a special package that includes a room upgrade to Delux and a fabulous breakfast for two until am  The rate this year was   Canadian plus taxes  The breakfast for two was easily a   value This is a quality hotel and the staff is very friendly and helpful  If you have a good attitude so will everyone else  Old Montreal is easy walking distance from the hotel and the metro is just down stairs  We purchased a  day metro ticket for   Canadian that was good on the subway and bus lines  You can travel and shop all over town and never have to put on a jacket using the subway  Our room had a view of Old Montreal and a city view corner room  The room was large by any standard  Large ble bath room with plush towels and robes  House keeping was excelent Our room was always fresh and clean  We will stay again next time 
P => Very nice rooms great location We had a three day stay here and it was extremely enjoyable  The rooms are very well furnished very clean with everything you would expect from a first class hotel  It is located at the very corner of the old historic district and the new part of time as well as being across the street from the convention center  You can walk to everything from here  We will definitely choose this hotel again  
P => Needs updating Ive stayed at the Inter Continental a couple of times usually when I come to Montreal for the Jazz fest  Im sure when it opened  it was one of Montreals best  Its still not bad altho the carpets are a little more worn or not up to par with a  star hotel chain like I C  I think for what you pay here the Sheraton is better  The service is pretty good altho Ive waited in line   ppl at the front desk for  mins before  The Minibar is pretty outrageous     oz bottle of Chivas Regal was    The bathrooms are this hotels party piece tho  arate tub amp shower neat looking european faucets and theres a speaker to play the TV over   never seen that before Most rooms have a good view altho Ive had one that faces inward before  The location is pretty good in Old Montreal across from the convention centre connected to the Metro  PArking is about  and only valet if I remember right  Again if you stay on a weekend try to park on the street but move your car before Monday am  As Ive said in other reviews Ill continue to stay at this hotel as long as they offer good rates   ish  
P => Perfectly Adequate Having booked a room at the Montreal InterContinental I was filled with trepidation when I read the negative reviews of this hotel posted in the summer  Much to my relief during my four night stay there last week I found the reviews to be largely inapplicable to my experience  The room was perfectly comfortable with conventional or and furniture  The staff was pleasant and accommodating when I requested a change of room for a view of Old Montreal and the St  Laurence and otherwise  The breakfast which was included in my package was generous and included smoked salmon as well as one omelette at my choice  The lap pool is wide enough for two swimmers but adequate for a workout  The fitness room is adequate although by no means world class  Finally the location of the hotel was excellent  on the edge of Old Montreal and within walking distance of all of the major commercial streets Ste  Catherine Sherbrooke St  Laurent and St  Denis  This particular InterContinental is not as luxurious as other hotels in the same chain but it is a cut above average  
P => Great value  Priceline given the location Over Labor Day weekend we paid night via Priceline which factors into the overall positive opinion somewhat  If we paid  or more Id be more disappointed   was a ridiculous bargain in my opinion  If not for the somewhat obscure location Id give it  bubbles  The lobby is cramped but who cares their barlounge is excellent for a pit stop for a beerwinecocktail and the french onion soup was top notch  The concierge desk was bilingual and very efficient and we had several excellent dinners on their recommendation  The breakfast in the hotel is totally overpriced  pp to fill you up and the ambience is a bit stuffy and there are a few good places within   blocks Eggspectations for one is a must but expect a   min wait that are a far better option  Just get up go out eat and get moving  The hotel wi fi in the lobby was a bust and the internet connection in the room required a technerd to come fix  The hotel itself is in a sort of no mans land in that you really have to walkcabmetro to wherever you are going there is virtually nothing within a   block radius to see or do  This makes it VERY quiet at night though so you can sleep in peace  You can walk to the heart of the old Montreal district in   minutes depending on your pace and there is a Metro station in the basement of the hotel  Montreal is a great walking town akin to Paris so expect to put on several foot miles each day to get the full experience which helps offset the massive caloric intake vacationing usually entails  You can get to Rue Catherine or Denis streets within   minute cab ride for   We ate at Verses in old town and the food and service was in Zagat terms a  on both accounts  Expensive figure pp with wine and dessert but very memorable  Avoid eating on the touristy square with the idiotic mimes and performers youll pay the most for the least quality and the service is churn and burn but the people watching from the outdoor patios is solid  Cabs are everywhere day and night and you can always fall into one when ready to drop  Rue Denis is a much better walking street for offbeat boutique shopping and outdoor cafe people watching  Rue Dennis is a mile long and worth devoting a few hours with a stop at a cafe to have sangria and a snack  Montreal is a great town at a discount for Americans  Beats Europe on price and attitude  
P => Better than I expected After reading the scathing reviews I was bracing for a miserable experience  With low expectations walking in I was met with a crowded small lobby and an entire wedding party checking out     ugh  Once I reached the desk I was ready for rude treatment but the officious attendant gladly switched me to a non smoking king room and what I thought was going to be a bad experience started to turn around  I booked through Priceline for a great price so I figured I would be a second class citizen but not so The room was pleasant with a nice floor to ceiling window and soothing colors  The bathroom was very nice  The location was just a couple of blocks from Old Town and Montreals efficient subway is right in the same complex  The recreation facilities are very nice the bar was nice a bit expensive and stuffy though  Heres a tip for those of you budget travelers the on street parking around the hotel is free on a couple of the streets and they dont start enforcing the time limits until  AM  I parked for free and saved   With food and all I stayed at this hotel for less than I would have paid at a roadside motel  
P => Not one of Intercontinentals best Hotels I have stayed in several Intercontinentals and whilst there were several great things about this hotel it is not one of their best although I have to admit I would stay there again as the positive points far outway the negative points  The location is superb and the staff extremely pleasant and helpful  I requested a high floor when I checked in and was extremely pleased to be given one on the st floor The reception area is too formal and has little atmosphere although the bar is fine and the bar staff were extremely pleasant  The rooms were big and well furnished but seemed a little dated and drab and the lamps in the bedroom had not been dusted for quite some time  The biggest disappointment was the bathroom however  The lighting was grossly inadequate and the bath was far too small and shallow Having said all this however I did enjoy my stay and as previously mentioned would stay again  
P => Disgusting Filthy Hotel I recently stayed at this disgusting dirty hotel  You are being warned stay away  The hotel is not in a central location and not recommended When we entered the room it was not made  The beds were undone room service was on the floor and the room smelled of smoke We immediately asked for a different room and had to wait over  hours to get one  I demanded an apology but hotel management is extremely rude  Not even a free drink while we wait In fact they rolled their eyes and gave us quotEuropeanquot attitude if you know what I mean  Supposedly this is ranked a  star hotel I have seen motels in America that are far superior I got this on one of those internet deals  Unfortunately it couldnt be cancelled otherwise I would have heeded the warnings by others on this board  You certainly get what you pay for night  Pay a few extra  and go to the other highly rated hotels TRUST ME What this places needs first and foremost is new management  I hope everyone going to Montreal reads this  
P => Nice place great location There is no question about it this property is nice however there is a long road from a good hotel to a great one and Intercontinental is just a good one  We move here from otel and stayed  nights starting   The hotel as it was mentioned many times is well located walking distance to the old town banks shopping and restaurants  This is a big place  floors I believe  restaurants shops spa and lots more  The restaurants appeared to us upscale and overpriced so we ided to eat down the street at many of the great restaurants in the old town  We got a room on the th floor with a view of an interior brick wall plus the window of an adjacent room  With exception of an obese middle age couple walking around the room nothing else to look at  Our room was clean the furniture was nice and the bed was comfortable  Good size bathroom but in need of a face lift  The wallpaper was pealing in a couple of places the shower head was shooting water in all directions and the tub plug was hard to keep it open I took all my showers in ankle deep water  Nice toiletries though  The concierge desk staff was professional but unfriendly  They shove a bad Xeroxed copy of Montreal in your face and k where you want to go  The front desk people were the same short and to the point no unnecessary smiles or pleasantries  As I mention this is a nice hotel in a great area that anyone should consider for a business or pleasure trip  
P => Good Location The hotels location was great being close to the waterfront old Montreal McGill the Village and many other museums and attractions  The hotel is attached to the underground so if you are traveling to Montreal in the winter this hotel is a terrific choice as you can limit your time outside  The only setback was on weekend evenings as many of the restaurants in the area were closed  The hotel room was large and kept clean during our visit  The concierge desk was extremely helpful having provided us with countless recommendations on restaurants and activities  Dont miss a Cirque Du Soliel show and make sure you obtain a Montreal card which will give you access to all museums and public transportation at a discount  
P => For all those interested in justice please read Hotel booking was mistakingly made  Is is non refundable that means you lose your WHOLE deposit  Hotel Manager unreasonable   wont negotiate anything  Out  and dont plan to stay  Reservation would still be  weeks out Cancelled the reservation to force the hand and working with my credit card company  How do you cancel something that is non refundable I dont know  Theoretically should not be possible Is this what one would expect from a good hotel or how about a good business Yea right  The previous guests posts say it all  Now you have experience pre stay and post stay Please punish this hotel in the interest of what is the right thing to do  Fool me once shame on you Fool me twice shame on me  You have been warned  
P => Lovely stay at the Intercontinental Stayed at the Intercontinental during a Memorial day weekend trip to Montreal with my new fiancee I proposed to her during the trip The room was very nice and clean and offered a very nice view of Montreal to the northwest including Mont Royal  Bathroom was very spacious and included both a bathtub and an enclosed shower  The room had all the usual amenities Staff was courteous especially the doormen and the valet employees The hotel was within a short walking distance to all the Old Town attractions as well as St  Catherines shops and Crescent St  cafespubs  You can also get to the Metro wihtout leaving the building   a plus during a rainy night although its not too easy to find Negatives   parking for the hotel was nine levels below as the parking is used for commercial business space  Valet employees were also not accessible late at night Overall we would definitely stay at the Intercontinental again on my next visit  
P => Comfy and quiet for the business traveller This is a great hotel if you are in Montreal for business  Its close to all the business amenities but little shopping  The rooms were spacious clean and comfortable  The door staff was friendly but I found the front desk staff aloof and not very helpful If youre just looking for a place to sleep before or after a business meeting then its perfect  However I would not recommend it for a holiday or shopping getaway  
P => disappointing for an Intercontinental I have stayed at other Intercontinentals and they are generally luxury hotels with excellent service  This was more pedestrian be more like a Sheraton  The building is new and doesnt have much character  The lobby is small and not impressive  We had a suite which had lovely big windows and a nice bathroom  The concierge gave us a good steer on a restaurant for dinner  This hotel is convenient to the Old City which is why I chose it  WHen I made the reservation the web site listed a special weekend deal but said you had to phone the hotel direct  When I called I had to argue very forcefully to get the special rate they said it didnt apply to them because they were in Canada I pointed out that the special was listed on the Montreal IC web site not the general Holiday InnIntercontinental webh site  At this price point I would not stay here again  
P => InterContinental   So awefull it hurts Dust bunnies on the curtains and brown stains on the bathroom floor  Let me know if you want to see the pics of these  This hotel is far from the  star rating that it claims to be  The reception staff left me totally unimpressed and questioning my own value as a human being   let alone as a customer paying  per night  
P => Good but not great The Intercontinental is a very good hotel for tourists   though the prices are only for those with big budgets  The lovely and quiet corner room that I had was not set up for work at all   with a very uncomfortable chair an expensive   and poor performing high speed internet connection and no electric outlet within easy reach of the desk to plug a laptop in The bathroom had a floor to ceiling window but a window shade that only covered the top two thirds of the window  Great for exhibitionistsRoom service food was good at night   a very filling club sandwich but poor for breakfast with a waffle that tasted like the butter or oil used in the waffle iron was rancid  
P => One of the best hotel in Montreal Great service spacious room  With amazing view of the Old Montreal  Restaurant is excellent  
P => Wonderful hotel My boyfriend and I just stayed here ober  and we loved it  The service from the moment we pulled up until the moment we drove away after checking out was exceptional  Other then the Bellagio in Las Vegas Ive never seen a group more dedicated to making your stay convenient and enjoyable  I booked directly through their hotel website and got a great deal  Also the hotel is attached to a business complex with shops a subway entrance and eatery area which is great in the morning if you want a quick bite  
P => Large rooms nice views I keep coming back to the InterContinental because the rooms are spacious and the high floor rooms have excellent views  Note that superior rooms are not guaranteed to have any view but repeatedly asking the front desk for a room with a view normally yields results  High speed internet CDN   is somewhat pricey as is room service but its one of the more modern hotels located near Old Montreal and has a good central location  
P => Just OK Just returned from a conference in lovely Montreal  The IC was OK but disappointing  First of all we had a quotspecial conference ratequot of  and I was denied priority points because of it I wondered how much this place tries to charge regular customers if  is a special rate  My answer was on the wall upon check out rack rate  Canadian and up Puh leze  The rooms are average  The bathrooms above average  The overall ambience average  The cocktail louge was nice and served good appetizers and lunches  Otherwise good luck with those rack rates IC  Even at  or so less no way  After walking past the St  James  or  times a day I know where Im staying next time     
P => Awful aful awful Just completed a  night stay at this awful hotel in Montreal  Have so many choices but keep asking myself WHY do I come back here  the front desk staff are so rude and un welcoming   ever wonder why they never ask you when you are leaving how wasyour stay  they DONT care and they treat business travellers like nothing if you have a great business rate they make you feel like garbage They should educate themselves as to why your corporate rate is so cheap and how easy it is to loose business The health club   nice pool amp sauna   but you think closing at pm is doing any justice to paying guests Is it rather to appease the staff so they can go home early and the young man mentioned that they were shut down already at pm Why would a hotel not staff more appropriately during peak times noon check out than having  people on staff and over  people in line up Ever heard of giving you a bill in the night before and offering express check out tini in the Cristallan bar is fab   but think when your waiter drops  pieces of your calai and picks it up off the dirty table and place it in a napkin next to your plate   sure I am going to eat it Such a waste indeed of this perfect location but to everyone I say   W Hotel is opening soon  minutes from the Intercontinental hotel MAKE YOUR WAY TO CANADAS FIRST W HOTEL I stayed at them in the USA and you are guaranteed service and a smile unlike the awful intercontiental hotel 
P => be a  star I stayed here back in the late s and the place hasnt changed one bit except that now they have very young staff who are unable to handle the flow  It took us  minutes to get checked in on a slow Friday night with only  people in line ahead of us  To top it off the front desk manager was too quotbusyquot to come discuss my incorrect room rate leaving the staff to fend for themselves  I saw him later that night and I think he  have been in his s  Am i getting old or should I expect a quot starquot to hire seasoned staff with ision making powerWill only stay here again if I get a deal in line with  star hotels in the city  
P => Convenient and elegant We just got back from a weekend in Montreal  The Intercontinental was great Very nice large room  No view but who cares  The staff could not have been friendlier or more accomodating  The hotel is in the midst of Old Montreal linked to a Metro stop Square Victoria and three blocks from the shopping on St  Catherine  Very quiet at night since this is a business district but cabs are easy to get and we felt safe walking the street at  pm If you visit Montreal you MUST go for bagels at St  Viator   simply the best bagels there are 
P => Great Hotel  
P => There are better options in Montreal  
P => Rude service dust on the curtains and mold in the bathroom  
P => Great Beds  
P => Very Disappointing Stay  
P => Great place in a convenient location  
P => A Wonderful Hotel  
P => Review Hotel Inter Continental Montreal  
P => Bien situ   
P => Intercontinental Montreal empfehlenswert  
P =>   
P => Tr s bonne exp rience  
P => The well furnished rooms and facilities   
P => Tr s bel hotel mais forte odeur de cigarette  
P => Etablissement de tr s bon standing au coeur de la ville  
P => 
P => It Sucks The warped floors in this Motel are covered by the UGLIEST carpet you will EVER see  Bring your own towels because if you take the quotweekly specialquot this means they DONT clean your room and you dont get a change of towels  But you WILL however save ten whole dollars The staff is beyond rude no customer service whatsoever  If youre looking to spend  a night to sleep in a slum just to downtown Montreal and find a rummy give HIM  and borrow is cardboard box for the night Find another inexpensive Motel this one BITES the big oneHORRIBLE 
P => dated basic Was booked here by my host for a job interview would not have been my choice The motel was built probably in the s and it shows there has been no significant upgrading or reation since then Pluses motor court layout each room has its own door and you can park right outside convenient location for airport access and locations in Montreal West quiet considering that its on a major street and near train tracksMinuses quottiredquot condition mattress was thin and a bit lacking in support no ventfan in bathroom 
P => OK but    For the price we were not expecting a lot but we stayed at other hotels during our trip which were comparably priced and much nicer  The staff here were very polite and helpful the problems were with the actual room  Cleanliness and appearance were lacking and a great staff could not make up for that  The continental breakfast was the worst we had in a long time  kinds of breadtoast no fruit  kinds of cereal and that was pretty much it We would not stay here again and recommend looking at other hotels in the area  One bright point just up the street try out the Piccasso Restaurant  and good food  
P => Meh This motel seemed a little on the worse for wear side  The key cards didnt work in the lock so we had to run back to the front desk  The room was small and the beds were meh  There was a mini fridge and a microwave but the chairs for the table were really uncomfortable The location is right off the highway which is good if youre coming from a far distance  we were driving from Charlottetown If you are staying more than  day in Montreal andor dont have a vehicle you will need to stay somewhere much closer to downtown Parking is weird as well  You have to park in front of your room and since there was a huge pile of snow we had to park on an angle in front of icy snow  This made getting luggage in and out a little tricky I didnt go for breakfast but my travel mates did and said there was only cereal and toast It was an ok place to crash for one night but I wouldnt stay there a whole week  
P => 
P => Ill stay here again  I recently stayed at LAppartment Hotel for a long weekend with my wife and  year old son  I booked a  bedroom suite which was very spacious and comfortablehad a well equipped kitchen free wireless internet and flat panel TV   The hotel also offers an indoor rooftop pool which was much larger than I expected and an outdoor k  Continental breakfast is included in the room rate  I was extremely pleased with the accommodations and will definitely stay here again  
P => Very good value Pros Huge and clean room which included a pretty well equipped kitchenette and a big brand new LCD TV helpful nice and courteous staff including the efficient maids  something not very easy to find elsewhere   good breakfast nice swimming pool good location Cons If anything dated and noisy window AC slow and smallish elevators less than adequate fitness facilities Overall Very good value accommodation 
P => Grate hotel  i recommend this hotel for a long stay especially if you are moving around the county we are a family of   adults and  kids where the appartment was roomy to take all of us generosity the service was great i got a good price for  bedroom apartment from the hotel directly for  days mid y till mid  including the breakfast buffet internet access and indoor pool in the rooftop the housekeeping services was there all the time The hotel is located in the top middle of the downtown it was so easy to reach every thing by walk   to the metro i rented a car and the parking was available under the building was close for me they have a great size indoor pool for free washing and dryer machines payable since my apartment was in the third floor the only thing i can say is the bedroom with ceiling fan was not airconditioned to reduce the streat noise while we are sleeping while the living room was airconditioned    so ask for higher floors apartment     the th and above  
P => Convenient Friendly and A Real Bargain I am a former Montrealer and until recently never really needed to stay in a hotel in my beautiful city  This hotel was never on my radar screen but now I want to let everyone know what a find it is  Affordable  CAD and convenient close to shopping and the subways and best of all great restaurants on St Denis  The room came with well supplied kitchen including a real stove  The room was clean and pleasant and breakfast was served daily  Big plus was free internet  What more can you ask for The parking was  and I had a few issues parking in the garage but all in I will return to this hotel again  
P => Great hotel Our family stayed here for  nights and had a great time  The room was spacious and clean    and we enjoyed having the kitchen  The pool is fabulous and the location of the hotel is very good  
P => Watch out for heat waves We booked  suites for two families with  and  kids ages    The rooms are spacious enough and a kitchenette is a plus to keep some milk for the kids and wine and cheese for the grown ups  Location is not bad a few blocks south and west would have been perfect but its very difficult to park in front of the hotel to loadunload on arrival and check out  Long term parking is rented from the other hotel across the street  Rooms are plenty spacious and fairly clean although our bedding didnt get changed during our  night stay  The staff is pleasant but help with luggage does not exist  Breakfast is reasonable  The pool on the top floor was a nice feature kids really unwound there after the day of sightseeing Two worst things about this hotel AC and elevator  We were unlucky to get F in Motreal at the end of ust our  bdrm suite only had one tired noisy inefficient AC in the living room  The fan in the bedroom vibrated too much to sleep under it safely  We opened the window with little relief   just to be awaken by a construction on the street at  AM another example of bad luck  The hallways are also not airconditioned There are only two small slow elevators for the entire buildings and they are heavily utilized by maintenance staff whose linen carts take up entire space  We never bothered to wait for the elevator to go down but you could spend  minutes really waiting if you want to use it Overall its an average discount property in a reasonably good location OK if you travel with kids but I would stay away from it during the summer  
P => Mostly great Young couple stayed here for  nights during y  for a vacation in Montreal during the comedy season Just for Lhs  Perhaps unusually we wanted to make a lot of our own meals and needed to work a fair amount on our laptops The location was great on the main Rue Sherbrooke artery near some major museums and a reasonable walk to much of the city  Theres a Provigo superket a couple of blocks away which was fantastic for buying food and lots of cafes and eateries nearby check out Avenue du Parc Room was OK   nothing special design wise but it did the job  Kitchen was compact and had everything we needed bathroom was fine too  We had a problem with the kitchen tap leaking which they fixed immediately except it never went completely cold after that  I couldnt be bothered complaining again and we filled the kettle from the bathroom tap We were on the th floor with our windowbalcony at the side of the building not on Sherbrooke  This made the room pretty dark and also left us near a huge noisy outdoor industrial fan  As a result we couldnt really concentrate on working with the windows or balcony door open   annoying  If youre going to spend considerable time in your room worth asking for a high floor Internet worked fine   EtherNet rather than WiFi Breakfast was pretty good   like most places in North America it was a bit of a carb fest but there was always fruit and fruit juice available  Worth getting to breakfast early   at around am there was generally no space to sit down which meant either loitering around or taking a tray up to our room  Judging by breakfast the crowd at the hotel seemed mostly to be couples often with kids Lifts were a pain  With two to serve  floors and the maintenance staff sharing them with the guests we often had to wait  minutes for a lift to arrive  And when one did it was often filled up by a housekeeper and a huge wheeling laundry bin  From the th floor going down stairs made more sense Pool was great and a fair size   often had it all to myself during the morning or early afternoon  In the evening there was usually at least one family with kids using it which meant no space to swim full lengths  Roof k off the pool was very pleasant although it is fairly unprotected and could get windy One other minor annoyance   on checkout there was a phone call on our bill from the first day  We were surprised but didnt argue since we were in a rush and it was only a few s  We realized afterwards it was probably left from the people who checked out of the room a few hours before we checked in  Hotel should be more careful about that  In general however no complaints about the staff who were courteous and friendly Bottom line at the price this was a great place to stay with a few annoyances as above  Its also worth considering Le Square Phillips the somewhat more upket and expensive sister establishment which is located more towards the business district And a tip Check for deals on www tourisme montreal org   we used the quotSweet Dealquot which gave us a  ish discount  
P => Great location great people Very friendly staff and in a great location  A couple blocks from the Fine Art museum a couple blocks from the Contemporary Museum in the other direction a couple blocks from the main drag on St  Laurent and a couple blocks from the metro to take you to old Montreal Beautiful rooftop pool and beautiful rooftop k with a patio that over looks Mount Royal Overall we loved it here  Only complaint would be that the bed in our studio was really hard  But I still slept alright 
P => Very nice hotel Am staying at the hotel now with my family  The rooms are clean and in great condition  Overall I think it is a great place to stay in fact I moved from another hotel to stay here Here are the pluses and minuses in my opinion Pluses  Good location close to restaurants and fun things  Pool  Very nice tastefully appointed rooms   big and recently refurnished  Staff is super nice  On site parking that you do yourself so you dont have to keep on tipping some valet or wait for your car  They dont charge for local calls but do for  numbers  High speed internet but not wireless  Balconies  Squeaky clean and nice smelling everywhere Ive lookedMinuses  lots of construction going on and is quite a bumpy ride to access their parking garage  quotexercise roomquot consists of  or  treadmill machines next to the sun drenched pool with no tv or anything  Needless to say it gets very steamy with the sun and the pool heat at least in summer   breakfast is all foods from the superket e g  kind of stale croissants cereals yogurt with lots of sugar and fruit  If you are looking for food rather than food products this breakfast is not the best    Building is under elevatored i e  you have to wait a long time at times but so is every hotel I have visited here in Montreal   No ramp up to building so if you are in a wheelchair or have a stroller we have a stroller it is hard to get in  This is apparently true of all of Montreal though they barely have curb cuts here   forget about ramps  Who knew the US could be more progressive than Canada  No dishwasher in our room dont know about others    
P => Just Right I booked this hotel to coincide with a trip to the Montreal Jazz Festival this past weekend and my friend and I couldnt have asked for a better place to stay We were within  minutes walking distance of the festival so the location was ideal  Even if you arent going to the festival its right in the middle of downtown and we were close enough to walk to the park the Latin Quarter the old town and to some of the coolest streets in the city  The hotel served a good continental breakfast  cereal fresh fruit juice toast bagels etc  We stayed in the basic room with one bed and the best part was definitely the small kitchen area  It had a refrigerator stove microwave and also included bowls and plates and cutlery  There is a grocery nearby and we went there one night to make our own dinner  The front desk staff were very helpful when we asked about side trips from Montreal and they even called a few places for us that we wanted to visit  We had a balcony room which was a nice surprise  The only drawback and its a minor one is that there is a single computer available for use so you might be waiting depending on if theres a line  We had rented a car and they gave us daily parking tickets to park at a nice hotel garage across the street  It cost  a day and we could come and go as we pleased with no additional cost  I would stay again at this hotel if I went back to Montreal If you book it check out the visit Canada website or tourism Canada I cant remember the exact site for a discount  Ours was called Sweet Deal and we received the th night half price and they also gave us a welcome bag of Montreal maple syrup products on our arrival  
P => Good location and great value I stayed at LAppartement from   th to   rd in one of their studio suites  For  per night plus tax I was able to get a clean comfortable suite in a good location in downtown Montreal In addition to the usual things one would expect from a hotel suite the studio suite included a kitchen and free in room Internet access for those with a laptop computer  Network cords are available from the front desk if needed Other facilities available in the hotel include an infrequently used pool on the top floor with views of the city several exercise machines and a sauna  On the main floor guests can also avail themselves of both a buffet style continental breakfast M F   weekends   and a one computer business centre at no extra charge  Service was consistently polite The McGill Metro station McGill University Parc du Mont Royal Place Ville ie the stores on Rue Ste  Catherine and the McCord Museum are all within a brief walk  A Provigo superket is just down the street and around the corner on Avenue du Parc if you need groceries  The LAerobus shuttle stops here and other tourist shuttles either stop here or at one of the three neighbouring hotels The only negatives were that the walls were a bit thin and my swimsuit still smelled strongly of chlorine even after rinsing  But those are just minor things  Overall it was a pleasant stay  
P => LAppartement Montreal Family of  recently spent  nights at this wonderful appartment hotel in downtown Montreal We walked in after we didnt like the rooms at the nearby Best Western on Sherbrooke We stopped on Sherbrooke at this location where there are  hotels   the riot CourtyardThe Holiday InnThe Deltathe Sheraton  points and LAppartment We started here and never got to see the rest We got a one bedroom suite for the price of a studio   the rooms are large and airywith a modern showerbath and a great kitchen with all mod cons We paid  CAD  Tax   per day for garage parking for our rental car Definitely a great find in pricy Montreal 
P => Great Bargain in Downtown Montreal Had a very pleasant stay at this hotel for four nights No its not a luxury hotel at all but of course the price indicates that  What you get here is a clean suite a balcony the option of parking continental breakfast free internet and convenience when it comes to the metro and downtown attractions The staff was very friendly and helpful  Internet service was reliable  The room was clean  LOVED having a well stocked kitchen if only for the convenience to pick up a few snacks at the superket which is just down the street The location was perfect   minute walk to two metros  Easy walk to the shops on Ste Catherine  Nice walk to restaurants on St Laurent  Comfortable walk minus the hills to Mont Royal  Even walked back to the hotel from the Old Montreal one evening The one downside was the continental breakfast  Montreal is known for great bagels and croissants why serve regular old superket bagels when you have access to Fairmount and St  Viateur Croissants were equally unappealing  Juice is obviously from concentrate or juice crystals  The breakfast works if you like a mediocre carb fest in the morning Would stay there again in a flash  Check the montreal tourism board website for any special promotions  Thats what we did and got an even better deal 
P => Great Deal Booked  two bedroom Suites for my bachelor party and it worked out real nice  We stayed in Rooms  and  and while the beds were a little small     people fit in the  rooms just fine There were plenty of towels and the fridge was a regular size perferct for storing beer Location was top notch    everything was with  blocks and definately walkable The staff was very friendly and only charged us at the room rate of  people per room Lastly breakfast was included and is open to any onegroup who has a room key to get into the breakfast room  While it wasnt spectacular mainly toast cereal muffins starch etc  it was the right price  
P => A Great choice We were very pleased with this hotel and have nothing to criticise The entrance is rather formal and the desk staff are very professional though friendly and helpful so you would think you were in a business hotel as you go in Our room was spotless well appointed and perfectly large enough for us two  The kitchenette has everything you need We had a balcony that looks out onto Sherbrooke Street west  It was nice to have but small and I found a bit vertiginous  If you want to sit outside its better to go up to the penthouse where next to the pool there s a rooftop k with views over the City and nearby Mont Royale A good continental breakfast is provided  It s plentiful though not very variedThe hotel is certainly in a popular spot  There is a Sheraton next door a Holiday Inn and a riott across the road and a Hilton is going up next to that  It s an easy walk to the subway McGill University the underground City and the information place on Dorchester square   and only a moderate walk to the waterfront and the Old city  There are plenty of restaurants nearby and a superket  We parked in the basement for  dollars a day plus taxes of course Free internet access and computer are provided in the breakfast room which was very convenient for us on vacation  
P => Suite bargain I stayed with friends at the Lappartement Hotel in y and was extremely happy with the hotels amenities and location  We stayed in a one bedroom suite complete with kitchenette queen bed in the bedroom and double sofa bed in the living room  The suite was huge and very clean with nice views of Montreal  The Metro was a  minute walk and we were in walking distance of the shopping and restaurant districts  Very pleased with the property the location and the service  Would be a great bargain for a family at  a night but note that that price doesnt include taxes and in the end we payed almost  a night  Still a good deal for what you get  
P => Wanted to love it but       I so very much wanted to love this hotel  Last year we had a wonderful experience at the jointly owned Square Phillipe and I had these grand ambitions of single handedly raising the TA ranking of this poor overlooked hotel  However after our  day stay I agree that this hotel is really just a  star hotel Our  bedroom suite was easily  square feet and had a beautiful view  However only one of the bedrooms had air conditioning and a small window unit at that There was also only one television and that was in the living room  The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed A grocery store is a short  block walk and the dining area was large enough for a pack n play for my toddler  We slept  people no problem  I thought the pull out sofa was uncomfortable but my  year old didnt mind it The biggest con of this hotel is the elevators  There are only  very small elevators to service  floors  Our wait at peak times was often  minutes or more  I found the breakfast to be very adequate bagels cereal coffee juice muffins fruit for a continental  Additionally the breakfast room had a computer with internet and a printer available  for guest use  The rooftop had a small inddor pool and laundramat which was also a nice added feature I also liked the location very much a short walk to the metro the contemporary art museum and some very nice restaurants  However I would choose the Square Phillipe over LeAppartment next time  
P => Disappointing Our recent stay here was only OK no more no less  Problems included a suite with only a room air conditioner in the living room leaving the bedroom uncomfortable an incredibly hard and noisy bed which left us sore in the morning parking in the hotel across the street not too convenient in the rain or any other time for that matter and a buffet with fairly low quality offerings  On the positive side the room was clean and the staff friendly if not always efficient  On one occasion we had called the front desk to report no hot water and I was promised a return call which never came  I will say when I inquired again the same staff member did apologize for failing to call me back  The location is convenient and cabs are easy to get out front  On balance though we would not return here  
P => Recommended   well priced and so spacious Stayed for  nights with husband and two children  and  in a  bed apartment  The apartment was so spacious with a full size diing table and chairs sofabed and recliner chair that the kids loved Great kitchen although we didnt use it other than coffee  Pool was clean and we were the only users each time  Breakfast was simple but plentiful and an added bonus  Good location for easy access to Eaton Centre and underground  Well recommended for families who need that extra space and the facility to make food if required  Overall very satisfying and enjoyable start to our holiday in Canada  
P => Great Stayed at the Appartement in early il  with my family of four  Staff was cordial and helpful  The  bedroom suite was clean and roomy  The kitchen came in handy as we ate in several times  The breakfast was plentiful and apprecitated by the kids who loved the toaster and the Eggo waffles  We never saw another sole in the swimming pool or the saunas  I would definately stay here again  
P => Good location affordable price Just returned from the  night stay at the LAppartement Hotel in Montreal The room we stayed in was a  bedroom sweet with a kitchen which is very nice especially for a family with kids  The rooms are not fancy but clean  The hotel has a nice swimming pool and complimentary continental breakfast provided The only disadvantage is uncomfortable mattress and pillows  
P => Great Location Average Hotel The Hotel is in a fantastic spot just two blocks from Rue Saint Catherine  My husband and I went up to see the Jazz Festival for a night and were thrilled that we didnt have to pay for a cab or the metro  The hotel itself was pretty clean and the staff were friendly  However the elevator is extremely small and usually there is a line for it   kinda strange when you keep in mind that this hotel is designed for long term stays every room even the basic one we rented has a full kitchen meaning most people would have a lot of luggage  Also if you want to use the underground parking it is   CADday and there are only a few spaces get there early  The basement you park in is very tight and hard to manuever around in so be careful 
P => Great Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week in   I am usually wary of hotels that include kitchenettes but this hotel was immaculate and ideal  It is centrally located right downtown by McGill University and walking distance to the Metro and buses  We asked for a room off of Sherbrooke Street and had our windows open the entire week  It was very quiet  An excellent breakfast was included in the price  We entertained friends and family at the hotel and so found the sitting room and fridge ideal  The staff were extremely helpful  I wouldnt hesitate to go back  
P => A very friendly hotel I stayed at the apt  for   mths the ppl are friendly thumb up for their service and the manager Steve is a wonderful man 
P => Good location price and comfort As we were a party of  we chose a  closed bedroom suite which also featured a small kitchen a living room and a bathroom I booked via their website and it was very easy  At CAD  excl  taxes per night it was very good value for money for four people and included a small breakfast buffet  The reception staff was helpful and courteous and was fluent in English and French We were on the th floor and there were very good views of Mont Royal on one side and of downtown on the other  The rooms were clean but one small bathroom for  guest up to six  be accomodated in this suite is not enough  The kitchen was well equipped The pool on the top floor had too much chemicals in it which made for swimming almost dangerous I had sore eyes for a whole day  Sports equipment is a joke with just one static bike and a running mill  No weights or anything like that  And since its by the pool it can be quite dirty there with people walking with their shoes and theres NO changing room either A very negative point was the fire alarm that went on one morning at   While I am grateful this hotel has a working fire alarm I have a problem when no one from the staff kept us informed during the entire hour we were to wait on the sidewalk in the freezing cold When we were cleared from the firefighters to go back to our room the elevators were not working and none of the staff knew what to do  We were glad we were only on the th floorAt no time did we get an apology from the staff or even a mention of the incident  Overall an average  class hotel which certainly is not top class  Will go back should we be a large party again  
P => Highly Recommended Four adults and one child stayed in a two bedroom apartment in this hotel  From the moment reservations were made the reception desk staff were polite and very professional and efficient  The accommodations were very clean from the beds to the bathroom to the kitchen to the living and dining rooms  The apartment was small but very quiet and tastefully orated  We stayed on the th floor and heard nothing from the moment we walked into the apartment This hotel can be aptly described as discreet  No one bothers you at all  If you need anything it is brought to your apartment promptly I used the sauna and the pool and shower and all were extremely clean  Towels were provided in the pool area as well as in the sauna and shower  There is one sauna for women and one for men Breakfast comprises of an assortment of juice  apple grapefruit or orange coffee and tea bagels croissant toast muffins cold cereal oatmeal in packets and fresh fruit along with the appropriate condiments to garnish your selection  It is self serve  Breakfast was maintained in a neat clean and organized room that looked onto the street life of the city  As soon as one table was vacated staff cleaned the table and it was ready for the next guest to arrive The sheets and pillows on the bed were comfortable and the towels were the usual white variety  The full sized sofa bed was unbelievably comfortable  I must say I was truly shocked by its comfort My party enjoyed this hotel immensely and it was conveniently located near the underground shopping area two blocks away and it was a super quick taxi ride to Old Montreal  for five people I highly recommend this hotel to families business travelers and single females traveling alone or in pairs  
P => Clean clean  clean        My  teenage dhters and I recently spent  nights at this hotel  We had a one bedroom suite on the th floor  I cant say enough good about the accomodations  Plenty of space and cleaner than you can imagine A kitchenette fully equipped a grocery store just one block away  And everything in the heart of downtown Montreal  Id highly recommend this hotel for anyone going to Montreal  PERFECTO  
P => an apartment not just a room We just got back from  days at this hotel and we were very pleased with the cleanliness and the spaciousness of the room  we were on the th floor and had a living room with a recliner a full dining room a kitchen with all the appliances dishes etc   and a full bedroom and of course a bathroom   we also had a balcony overlooking the street    we went to the top floor just to see the pool sauna and a balcony overlooking the city  all very nice   and there is even a room with washer and dryers so that you can do your wash   and breakfast was ok   the usual croissants and rolls and bread etc   but in a very nice room overlooking Rue Sherbrooke  we even found parking on the street   we had to move the car in the am but that was fine   I would recommend this hotel   
P => Great Location Great Price Hotel  LAppartmentLocation  MontrealTime Of Stay  il   This is a really nice place to stay  It is situated right in the centre of downtown on Sherbrooke Street and is easily accessible by a nearby Metro stop McGill  There are plenty of places to eat and things to do  It is also near to the university so there are always people around and it feels safe at night  The room is spacious compared to what I am used to with a desk comfy leather chair lovely cosy bed big screen TV and a kitchen which I never used  It had a microwave oven cutlery fridge etc  The bathroom was a bit small but not too bad  My room was cleaned daily   if I put the notice out rather late in the afternoon it was still done by the evening  The only bad thing about the hotel room was it had no curtains   well it had these tiny half curtains with a netting behind so all the daylight came through  Oh and they offered a free hotel breakfast   I used it one day and had cereal and a muffin it was buffet style so help yourself  
P => Loved LAppartement I recently stayed at LAppartement Hotel on Sherbrooke St  in Montreal on the advice of several trip advisor reviews and it was great The staff were friendly helpful and accommodating  The apartment I was in was clean extremely spacious and comfortable  And the hotel is conveniently located to downtown and to a nearby grocery store to make the kitchen included very useful  I would recommend this to anyone staying in Montreal especially families and the budget conscious as you can save a lot on means  The rates were very competitive too  
P => Great for the Spring Breakers This hotel gives you a great room for a fair price  My roommate and myself found this to be excellent because the more money we had in our pockets the more clubs we could get into  
P => Great rooms Great rate Travelled to Montreal to catch hockey game in   and stayed here and we were all blown away by the rooms  For the price it wasthe best value Ive ever seen that close to downtown amenities  As for the hotel itself the rooms were spacious ours had  bedroom with pullout coach in livingroom with kitchenette and clean with a great view of the city  Most attractions within easy walk   min  of hotel Highly Recommended 
P => Loved this hotel Just came back and was very pleased with the hotel  Stayed in the  bdroom apt which was spacious  Staff was very helpful and friendly  Great location metro just a block away  Want a night out go to House of Jazz  Will stay here again  
P => Great hotel great location

P => H tel passable  
P => Fantastic hotel My husband and I experienced  nights stay at this lovely hotel As others already stated the hotel was perfect to us as well All of the staffs are friedndly and helpful After  hours travel from Japanwe finally arrived Montreal very tired at midnight we are invited into the beautiful room promptly and had a good sleep in the big clean bed As air company lost my suitcaseI asked the front desk to let me know when the suitcase was delivered as soon as possible  They seemed to keep it in mind and checked the status of the suitcase on PC often and told me what was going on with it   When my wheelchair was partially brokenthey called a hotel mechanic and the man came in  minutes and fixed its wheel Let me add that even guests with wheelchair can enjoy the hotel stay without any problem They made reservations for the taxi  musical concerts and so on for us The advices they gave us what to dowhere to visit in Montreal were corect and we really enjoyed the city The Congress center was juts  minutes walk from the hotelthis helps my husband a lot I could go to Place de Art in ten minutes walk and enjoyed the museum exhibition and the musical Evita there I could walk to downtown area in some  minutes with my wheelchair The hotel location was good They offer a nice breakfast and a cocktail time with cheese and wine for free They also have a good restaurant which wins a good reputation I really love the hotel and will be back in ober again Please excuse me for my poor English  
P => Faultless Stayed here for  nights on holiday and it was excellent  We payed ca per night but we were upgrded to a suite which was huge and very well orated appointed and furnished The staff were the most genuine and helpful that I have encountered in a long time  The concierege Luc noticed us waiting for a tour in reception   he came over checked that we were ok phoned the copmpany and organised a takeaway breakfast  Breakfast was nice with a good selection and I enjoyed the bar food too  
P => Loved this Boutique Hotel and Staff I stayed at the Hotel Place dArmes for business and was treated to lovely accomadations a friendly staff that treats every guest like a VIP and a luxurious atmosphere  Unlike other hotels I stay at for business this felt like a mini vacation I walked into my room and found music softly playing a large standard room with natural lighting a large comfortable bed a large bathroom shower only and was delivered cookies and water that evening I had cheese and wine in the bar and the bar manager was very friendly remembered who I was and who I was seen with the following evenings so he could point me in my parties direction  He made sure everyone was comfortable had a drink or food in hand without being overbearing  Breakfast in the morning was full of choices the food was good and the coffee was strong I had a lovely stay and look forward to my return  I would stay here for business or pleasure without hesitation and highly recommend this hotel for either  
P => if youre picky stay here My husband and I have stayed in many hotels in different cities based on reviews were read on Tripadvisor  This was one of them and all the prior reviews were definitely accurate We are VERY picky travelers who always stay in the most high end hotel we can find for under night and found this stood up to our expectations and then some  This is a very nice VERY clean boutique hotel in a perfect location with lots of great extras for a very reasonable price  It is one block away from the Metro stop and is located right in Old Montreal  There is FREE wine and cheese served in the hotel bar area or the rooftop terrace if you prefer every afternoon  The continental breakfast also FREE was excellent  I dont know what others were expecting when they complained about it in their reviews  They had a very nice selection of bread cheese delicious muffins bagels lots of fruit juices cereal etc etc  More than good enough to fill you up so you can enjoy your morning sightseeing Free daily newspaper too  The room was very nicely orated and spotlessly clean and we were in the OLD part of the hotel  Valet parking expensive as usual but good service  Overall we try to find nice classy hotels that we look forward to returning to after a long day of sightseeing and that are part of the experience of traveling to the city were staying in and this one was another perfect find 
P => Fantastic   couldnt fault it Recently expanded we were fortunate enough to have one of the rooms in the refurbished new wing on the third floor  The rooms are large the beds huge and comfortable the shower equally large and luxurious  The location couldnt be better   opposite the Basilica near a Metro The hotel provides a Continental breakfast in the cost and there is free cheese and wine each evening  The staff are helpful friendly and bilingual I cant praise this hotel enough  Its excellent in every way  
P => Great Hip Luxurious Hotel All of the prior reviews are accurate this is a great hotel  The location in old Montreal is as good as any right next to the Notre Dame Cathedral  The Hotel gives a hip luxurious feel in the lobby and barrestaurant area  The hotel gives free wine and cheese parties at night and breakfast in the morning in a great room with a very cool hip vibe  I had two kids with me and while all staff was very courteous and warm make sure your kids are behaved it is an adult feel to the room The guest room is another ultra hip luxurious suprise  I am suprised I have not read about the bathroom which is better than any I have stayed including W and Ritz hotels  Take the time to find the rooftop barrestaurant  There was no one there when we went up including workers even though the outdoor grill was on and it is not promoted but it has a great view and worth the time The other top rated hotels in old Montreal seem to be equally nice but when we went in y the Place DArmes was a solid   cheaper so go with it By the way I am not easily impressed and this is a great hotel  
P => Excellent and Superb Attention It is a terrific hotel the location the staff the breakfast the bed the linens the bath we pay CA per night and it worth every penny  
P => Boutique Hotel DArmes Pleasant Surprise We are a family of  and stayed at the Hotel Place DArmes summer   When we first drove up we thought it was a dump from afar because it is located on the edge of a reated section  What a delightful surprise  When the front doors opened we were in heaven Gorgeous modern lobby w comfortble seating delicious snacks friendly service tastefully orated room although a bit small but fine a small workout room a pretty public terrace overlooking the city and all in a perfect location at an affordable price Highly recommend this lovely boutique hotel 
P => Loved this little hotel Possibly the nicest hotel experience I have ever had  The staff was incredibly helpful the restaurant downstairs had lovely food the location was ideal  I have absoulutely no complaints  I loved this hotel and so did the other four people who came with me ranging in age from     I noticed that other people have reked on the room size but my opinion is this when you stay in a boutique hotel in the middle of a city as beautiful and cosmopolitan as Montreal youd be a fool to stay in your room for any long stretch of time  The rooms are not spacious but they are beautifully appointed and perfect for relaxing after a day of sightseeing  Bigger is not always better  
P => Perfect Romantic Getaway Five wonderful days   at the Place DArmes superior room with a view of the Noter Dame Catheral across the street  Service in all respects perfect staff was just super friendly and nice to my wife and I  Rooms were just as described on their website zero disappointments  Kept spotless by the housekeeping ladies  Loved the evening free wine and cheese as well as the breakfast in the morning  Roof top great place for a glass of wine plate of cheese sit and view the Old City  Hotel located in the Old City just a short stroll to the port  Many many wonderful large small quaint place to eat all price ranges  Metro stop one block down the hill from the hotel in case you wanted to explore the other delights of Montreal  Flew in CAN cab ride from the airport no car rental necessary  I planned the trip as a romantic getaway for my wife and I who reside in Destin FL  It was all that and more thanks to the Place DArmes and its superb staff  I will stay there again  the hotel is expanding to include additional rooms and suites Bristo in the lobby and new Bar as well as a top of the line SPA  all of which will be fully operational by mid e   
P => Romance Package was great Following is a very long review of our stay at the Hotel Place DArmes on   and    Hotel Place D Armes is a very nice boutique hotel in a prime section of Old Montreal a short walk to both the old port and downtown Montreal  The hotel is a little hard to drive to because of all the one way streets and the street is full of construction vehicles working on Phase  of the hotel making it hard to find a place to pull over grab your luggage and hand off your car to the valet however with a little maneuvering it can be done  The staff at the check in is very friendly and accommodating quick with directions and always greeting us warmly after our outings  The valet was very helpful going back to our car to retrieve items we had forgotten in our haste to avoid blocking the road when arriving The lobby public areas and guestrooms of the hotel are classically orated and very pleasing  Coffee tea cappuccino and espresso are available in the lobby at all times which is a nice bonus We booked the quotRomantic Getawayquot for our anniversary for  which with taxes and parking came to  for two nights The package inclusions listed on the website are as follows Accommodations for two nights in one of our loft style suites  Continental breakfast served in bed  Wine and Cheese Cocktail every night  Dinner for two at Restaurant Aix cuisine du Terroir service included  Two   hour of massage in the comfort of your bedroom or our dedicated massage room  Chilled champagne  AccommodationsPerhaps Im wrong but Ive always assumed a loft indicates a second floor  The hotel does have some two storey suites however when our confirmation was e mailed it stated quotKing Deluxe Roomquot  I e mailed the hotel and asked why it stated quotKing Deluxe Roomquot when the website stated quotloft style suitequot and I was told that they are the same thing  In any case our room was of average size with a nice double jacuzzi tub  All the photos of rooms I have seen on the web show what is likely a suite  However that being said the room was very nicely orated  We had a corner room with three high windows and a nice view of the edge of the cathedral  The furniture is very attractive and well laid out the bathroom nicely done with good shampoos and soaps etc  and best of all the king size bed is very comfortable  Although I would not say our room was large it was a fair bit larger than the standard room in which we had our massages  Although there is a lot of construction currently going on next door we were never bothered by any noise  I found the room very comfortable and attractive  In our room documents were a couple of business cards with my husband s name and our hotel contact information presumably to give out during business meetings   nice touch  Continental BreakfastWhen we checked in we were told that we had a choice of breakfast in the restaurant or in breakfast in bed  We chose to go down to the restaurant and for a continental breakfast we found it very good  There was a wide selection of fruit breads yogurts and beverages as well as some cereals and hard boiled eggs  One strange thing we noticed was that there were no salt shakers anywhere and no salt packets  We asked a waitress for salt and she appeared to look for some but evidently never found any   she didn t come back in any case  Other than for the hard boiled eggs salt probably wasn t necessary   Wine and Cheese CocktailAt check in you are given two slips that entitle you to your Wine and Cheese cocktail  The wine and cheese was served in the bar section of the restaurant it might have been nicer if it had been in the lobby bar which never opened during our stay  You receive one glass of wine per person if the server asks you if you would like another make note you will be billed  plus tip for two glasses of wine   Dinner at Restaurant Aix Cuisine du TerroirAt check in you receive a voucher for your dinner and you just need to tell the front desk when you would like to have the dinner  I had thought that we would be able to order from the regular menu however it turned out that the Romance Package has a set menu  We were give a choice of soup or appetizer although once we made our choice they brought us both anyways choice of two entrees cheese plate and dessert  We had the arctic char with risotto and although the risotto was rather tasteless the fish was good  I was too full after a bit of cheese to order a dessert but my husband had one and it was very good  Other than the risotto all the food was well prepared and nicely presented and service was very good as well  Tips were included but we chose to tip a little extra for the service  Two   hour of massageAh the best part of the trip  I m not really one for massages  I ve had a few that left me less than overwhelmed however our massages at the hotel were excellent  Our masseur was very very good and I was impressed enough that I  actually go for a massage again someday   I definitely will if we return to the hotel  ChampagneThe front desk will bring up the champagne whenever you like we had it delivered soon after we checked in  It was a half bottle of Moet amp Chandon not cheap and was delivered on ice  It was very enjoyable  SumyWas the package worth it I d say yes seeing as the King Deluxe Rooms are nearly  a night before tax  The standard room is nearly  a night and would probably feel a little small in comparison to your average North American hotel room  It turns out that the wine and cheese and continental breakfast are included for all guests so the Romance Package s extras are the dinner champagne and massages which I m guessing would retail for much more than the difference we paid between booking just the room or booking the package  The hotel is in a great location for exploring Old Montreal and is a welcome refuge after a long day of shopping and sightseeing  Would I stay at Hotel Place D Armes again In a heartbeat  
P => Spring break We stayed he for a couple on nights at end of ch  Excellent finishing details through out the hotel to the common parts and the rooms  Small hotel but good individual service and attention to any requirements  Rooms stylishly finished and great value for money   beats most of the larger chains  Rate included breakfast and early evening wine and cheese  
P => Attention to detail    Stars  Stars  Booked this hotel based on the recommendation of an industry expert in the boutique hotel field  Hotel was very nice comfortable and the staff were extremely friendly  Icing on the cake   concierge brought car back from valet parking on Sunday and it had been washed it was sparklingThe hotel is small with approx  rooms  As a result the general feel around the hotel was quiet  The main foyer  bar area is very impressive however the bar was not open beyond the Directors Cocktail Reception in the evening PM to PM which was unfortunate given the high ceilings and funky chandelier lighting  It is quite the space Rooms were very  Bombay  style   which is not my taste and the bathroom was a good size with black and white  art o  feel to it  Products were Essentiel Elements of San Fran which were replaced with new products each day   no penny pinching on these items  Our room was on the th floor  Only point to note for future is the ice machines are located on the rd and th floors  By chance when we were riding the elevator it stopped on the th floor and there it was the ice machine sitting directly outside the doors of room number  and   Location was great   across from Notre Dame Basilica and one block from Palais de Congres Overall a great weekend away  The restaurant is very good and again the staff here were also very friendly and accommodating  Definitely recommended  
P => A Fine Stay at the Place dArmes I stayed in the hotel for five days during the first week of il  I was attending a conference at the Palais des Congres which was conveniently one block away  My room was clean comfortable and tastefully orated  Compared to similar hotels in the UK the room was good sized  The bed was comfortable and had good lighting for reading  In the closet was a terrycloth robe slippers and an umbrella  I found no fault with the room but would have liked more tv channels  The breakfast selection was wide and varied with smoked salmon fresh fruit museli croissants etc  I had trouble tearing myself away from the chocolate croissants  After a couple days the waiter knew my preference for tea over coffee  I wont say that the hotel staff was very friendly but they were always polite and helpful  Examples when I lost a button off my coat they gave me a sewing kit  They volunteered to call the airport bus sevice for me and when I checked out handled the VAT refund process for me  Considering that I dont speak French I thought that they were patient  I didnt want to leave and Ive had that feeling about hotels very rarely  
P => Beautiful Hotel  We stayed at the Hotel Place DArmes for two nights at the end of ust  We thought the hotel had a lovely atmosphere  It is beautifully orated throughout   roomsbathroomslobbyrestaurant and bar and even the corridors amp was all very clean  Our room was an average size and a calm relaxing place to retreat to after a day sightseeing  We prefer to eat out in the city rather than in our hotel usually but we ate at the restaurant both nights as the food was so good the first night Free wine and cheese and all day coffee were unexpected extras as is the roof terrace  We loved it here amp like the previous reviewer our only reason for the  star rating as opposed to  is that we found it quite noisy noise from outside the hotel not from inside it  However this was the only negative for us and we would definately recommend   just take ear plugs  And try the restaurant   it wont disappoint  
P => Wonderful My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel a couple of months ago  Its wonderful cozy and elegant  For those reading other reviews be aware that it is very normal to pay for parking at hotel in a city  As it is also expected that the rooms will not be enormous by U S  standards however our room was a corner and generous in size  The hotel staff is kind and helpful they just dont mush all over you like people in America expect  
P => Great Little Hotel My husband and I recently stayed three nights at Place DArms in Montreal  The rooms were very clean and the linen very plush and comfortable  The rooms are very small though  The breakfast was very good in the morning  The staff was very friendly and helpful  Location was very close to the metro and very near old Montreal  I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay here again  It was a perfect place to stay if you like smaller hotels that give you more personal attention  Also wine and cheese every afternoon and the rooftop terrace were nice extras   
P => Absolutely elegant My wife and I stayed here for a romantic second honeymoon in ch   We loved it and wouldnt change a thing  Wonderful appointments fantastic reation and the corner rooms with the king beds the view of the Cathedral and the jacuzzi are worth the upgrade  Best breakfast included with a room Ive ever had    lox and bagels and cream cheese and capers Outstanding  Wed go back right now if we could  
P => A little insight to hotels I have just read an earlier reviewer I thought I would post a response and comments concerning my stay  First off I am a travel agent and fortunately for me that clues me into various aspects of the trip building world  I will provide a few helpful FYIs to avoid much displeasure when staying at hotels  BUYER BEWARE  Very few hotels are willing to share all of the details of their charges when you book with them  They are selling when they are on the phone with you and the less information the betterthis is with all hotels  They take your credit card for guarantee unless they advise you that they are charging your card a deposit  Unfortunately we must be responsible in knowing that there are charges you will incur staying at a nice hotelparking fitness room internet usage movie rental additional items you forgot at home etc  You must ask about these things  Funny enough a luxury hotel Ritz would be shocked that you didnt expect to be charged  Also please understand that the hotel you are talking to is not the only one in the area with this problem  There is not a sufficient amount public parking in montreal so you will encounter this charge at most upscale hotels or all hotels for that matter  You will also see that if went to a public parking garage it will charge you more  As you stay at more hotels you will find these stupid little charges and because you have experienced them you will ask in the future  Travel is very much a quotbuyer bewarequot world and it is so for travel agents too  Just thought I would pass along  As for this hotel   I thought it was excellent when I stayed there  years ago  It was beautifully done and I also encountered a bunch of additonal charges  I knew about mine because I asked  We did have a problem with our hot water and it took two trips to have someone resolve the issue  This in no way affected our trip  We would stay there again and give it no second thought  
P => Great boutique hotel Fantastic or with exposed brick and modern furnishings  Delicious complimentary breakfast  Small but usable workout room  Only disappointment was at checkout  I was incorrectly charged for a mini bar item and when I disputed it the front desk said that they have no way of proving or disproving that I had taken the item  When spending that kind of money on a room     Im curious what kind of motivation a person would have to take an item that cost  Can Other than this mishap     I highly recommend the hotel  
P => Just great Were jsut back from Montreal where my fiancee and me spent the week end  What to say about this hotel which is not a superlative probably the best service weve ever had one of the best appointed and orated rooms even if weve been lucky to test some luxurious hotels suites a great location within the Vieux Montreal area and a very good breakfast for free  Thats for sure the next time we go to Montreal thatll be there and nowhere else 
P => Great Hotel We had a great stay here  The staff was more than helpful  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed with good quality linens  The level of service was very very high  I couldnt be more enthusiastic  
P => Enjoyed Place dArmes I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend at the hotel  The staff was extremely helpful making restaurant reservations and otherwise  The rooms were a smaller than expected but were nicely appointed  Hotel is very well located with easy access to Old Montreal  Also the newly opened restaurant downstairs has an excellent complimentary buffet breakfast as well as superb lunch and dinner menus  I would stay there again but be aware of the room size  
P => Perfect retreat in MontrealHotel Place dArmes Our first trip to Montreal and what a treat to happen upon the perfect anniversary retreat for my husband and I  Simply elegant would sum up our impression of this warm and friendly hotel  The staff is extremely accomodating in their command of both the French and English definition of the word hospitable  Lovely environment with access to the best of Old Montreal  
P => Spectacular choice for Montreal My husband and I loved the Hotel Place DArmes for our ober stay  Sophisticated chic stylish  Our room was quite fashionable too  The staff were helpful and the location is ideal    blocks to the metro and a  block walk to vieux Montreal  The hotel is located on a somewhat busy corner and the street cleaners woke us up a few times in the early early am  The hotel shows its popularity as there are a few dingsdents on furniture  But the pillows were the best weve ever slept on and bought  from the hotel before going home 
P => Fabulous What a fabulous hotel The service was wonderful the staff efficient and attentive  The room was immaculately clean large beautifully appointed  Every little detail had been graciously thought through  The bathroom had the most wonderful bath I have ever had in a hotel room   big enough for me to lay almost flat and deep enough that I could be submerged to my shoulders without duct taping over the overflow From the moment I arrived the staff called me by name and made me feel most welcome  Bravo   well done 
P => Great place to stay My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Place DArmes  When we arrived at the hotel we were confused about where to park our car for check in  I went into the hotel for assistance and the concierge came outside unloaded our luggage and parked the car for us  Amazing service The rooms are a bit small but elegantly orated  The beds are extremely comforable and the toiletries top notch  Also the breakfast was amazing Really fresh fruit pastries bagels amp lox etc  Would definitely stay there again  
P => Very Nice Boutique Hotel

P => A quaint and charming hotel in Montreal City Center Staying at this hotel was a wonderful experience The location is fantastic easily able to walk to shopping restaurants pubs attractions and just steps from the metro make it the perfect location for beginning your exploration of Montreal The rooms where clean beautifully orated and the staff where helpful friendly and accommodating  The hotel is in an old brown stone building that has been completely reated rooms are very modern The breakfast that is included is delicious and provides much more choice then the usual toast and juice offered my most hotels  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a charming and convenient location to explore Montreal from  
P => Amazing hotel and impressive atten I stayed at this hotel with a friend and was very impressed by everything offered  I loved that it was a small hotel with just  rooms and our room was very clean and modern  With beautiful wood floors huge windows a very comfy bed the shower with a rain shower head and the in room magazines and espresso machine we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  The breakfast at the attached restaurant was delicious and we found Albert to be very helpful and friendly  Next time I am in Montreal I will definitely stay here again 
P => It is like family only much much better  Another visit just a special as the last  Alberts wonderful greeting and the attention to detail makes this an always great stay  
P => Just do it This is a first  I am actually writing the review about   hours after I have arrived  Everything everybody says is true  I am travelling for business and was due to stay for  nights but it was cut short to  night  How disappointed am I I am in room    a suite   with a wonderful terrace that I will not have time to use  If I am ever back in Montreal without any hesitation I can say I will check in here  
P => Small is better We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Le Relais Lyonnais  It was a nice change from the typically large hotels  It was very comfortable and the owner couldnt have been more friendly and helpful  We so enjoyed his restraurant next door that we ate all of our meals there  This is a must for people who want a change from the usual hotel experience  You cant beat the location  
P => Wonderful hotel near to everything I booked this hotel for a romantic birthday getaway for my wife  After reading the reviews of the Le Relais Lyonnais I ided that this was the place to take my lovely bride for her birthday  The hotel did not disappoint Albert greeted us upon arrival and was there for our every need  Parking is available in underground parking around the block under the theatre for  dollars a day it is secure but a bit of a walk to the car in the mornings as the elevators in the theatre do not go down to the parking garage until around eleven am  This means that you must walk around the building then walk down the ramps to the third level as this is where they have you park for long term  Breakfast was included with our stay but if you would like to enjoy a nice omelette fresh fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice you must ask about this at the time of booking as I don t think it is automatically offered  The suites are very nice and modern my wife loved the shower it has both a rain head and a handheld shower sprayer that can be adjusted from gentle mist to skin peal  I preferred the strong spray as it gave a wonderful feeling after walking all over the city  There is a computer provided on the third landing with internet access and a printer provided for free there is also wireless access provided to all guests  I found the signal and speed on the third floor to be excellent  The hotel is about a fifteen minute walk to Old Montreal and is located near a collage campus in the Latin Quarter  The street is lively all day but it isn t obtrusive or unseemly   The only thing that must be noted is that this is a converted home to boutique hotel that doesn t have an elevator the suites are on the third floor that is accessed by a narrow winding staircase  If you are mobility challenged then you should ask for a room on the first floor  You would have to only negotiate the first flight of stairs from the street  If you can t climb any stairs than this is not the hotel for you  It isn t the least expensive but for what you get it is quite reasonable  I would not hesitate to book there again the next time I am in Montreal  
P => The hotel manager albert is the reason why to choose this hotel So helpful so generous Mr  albert welcomed us after a long drive from Vermont USA to Montreal Here in Montreal a nice suite was waiting for us the hotel provides free parking in the theatre building opposite the hotel full breakfast at the coffee shop on the first floor of the hotel in which he is a partner  This is a very popular location for young Montreal Canadians always busy and there was even a birthday celebration of a young fellow with his many friends having breakfast together Albert sdvised us of  fine restaurants a Greek one and a French one both were proven to be fine The suite was furnished in a contemporary style the flat large sattelite TV with many channels to choose from the free WiFi and the comfortable bad all made our stay very pleasant  
P => We loved this hotel This small hotel with only  rooms is spotless in a great location and run by a hotel owner that genuinely cares about your stay  Albert is the owner and makes sure you have what you need and treats you like an old friend  This was our first trip to Montreal so he gave us a map and circled areas we quotmust seequot and generally helped us understand where to go  He called and made reservations at a restaurant where the locals go Le Petite Extra spoke to them and got us set up at a great table  Parking is across the street around back in an underground garage for  a day  It is worth it since parking in that area looks awful and our car was fine  The rooms are cozy absolutely clean and have everything you need  This room had the best shower I have ever used and the espresso machine was also great  I will always stay here when in Montreal  Albert also ownsruns the restaurant downstairs which has wonderful breakfasts  
P => Wonderful location spotless great character  We stayed at this hotel t          We were celebrating our wedding anniversary with a week in Montreal and chose Le Relais after reading about it on TripAdvisor com   I always choose our hotels this way  We would certainly stay at Le Relais again we had a great stay and were very happy We had one of the third floor suites and it was very nicely orated and absolutely spotless  Bathroom was wonderful   large shower all new ultra modern fixtures including hair dryer and electric wall heater a ceiling fan that actually worked and wonderful soft towels  Bath sheets and robes provided  There was a safe in the room always a great place for passports and cash as well as a small refrigerator which was stocked daily with  bottles of water no charge and creammilk for the coffee  The coffeeespresso maker worked well  The bed was quite comfortable queen size and the temperature control unit fanair conditioner is remote control  There was a small balcony with two chairs and a small table which would have been great if the weather had been better  The sitting room had very modern furniture new and not worn out like most hotels  Floors were beautiful hardwood with area rugs in both rooms  All very clean  The entire suite was very well maintained and cared for  I am extremely fussy and I was impressedWe had breakfast provided daiily during our stay   there is a little restaurant under the hotel owned by the hotel   and it is wonderful  Breakfast is anything you want on the breakfast menu   omelettes crepes eggs wonderful pastries juice coffee etc  It was superb   both food and service  Delicious efficient and plentiful  It is reason enough to choose Le Relais Breakfast with the room is not mentioned on the web site   make sure you ask when you reserveThe location was great for us  We had chosen to use public transportation instead of renting a vehicle   a first for us when on vacation  We have no regrets  There is a Metro station less than a block away and it is a major hub   it was exceedingly easy to use the Metro and buses  St  Denis is a very busy city street   literally dozens of shops and restaurants clubs coffee shops etc  People everywhere all hours Our suite was on the front of the building   if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs or request a suite on the back of the building  The noise was not a problem for us  I think the hotel has limited parking so check when you book  Otherwise street parking is very limited and busy  Tons of shopping within walking distance No hotel is perfect   so here are a couple of things worthy of note  Le Relais advertises free wi fi in all rooms  The internet service was quotspottyquot at best  At times it was okay   but more often than not we could not even connect we have two brand new laptops with good wireless cards  I did call the front desk and spoke to Albert   but there were no suggestions  They also have a quotBusiness Centerquot on the third floor   it is a desk with computer with internet access complete with printer and paper supplied   however this computer has extremely limited internet access as well  So   if internet access is imperative this is not the place to stay  There is a coffee shop a couple of doors down with free wi fi and the service there is excellent  as is the coffee   There is rarely anyone at the front desk   in fact over the course of a  day stay we saw Albert once This is not a problem however there are times when it would be helpful to ask questions or seek advice regarding directions etc  I found this frustrating at times   If you are on the second or third floor it is important to note that the stairs are relatively steep and long  Good handrails but it is a beautiful old character building  If you have issues with stairs you might want to request a room on the first floor  It is a LONG hike to the third floor suitesThese three items are simply things that should be considered when choosing accommodation as everyones needs are different We would absolutely stay at Le Relais again  
P => Many good features While the rooms are very nicely appointed I believe Trip Advisors quot  ratingquot of hotels in Montreal is unrealistic  There are many wonderful hotels in Montreal in better locations and with more consistent amenities First  I say that the guest rooms and bathrooms are lovely though bathroom could use some shelf space  Spotlessly clean small fridge with complimentary bottled water  Very comfortable bed and nice linens  Comp breakfast was a great touch though  a m  opening made it impossible for business travelers  Loved the Nespresso coffee machine However   this hotel is in a university district surrounded by student level bars and restaurants and at the seedy end of Ste Catherine St  Hotel managers were gracious and accommodating   but little details were amiss very poor hair dryer shampoo and hand lotion no conditioner in the shower only two towels AC system difficult to control closet racks too low for hanging pants or dresses We travel to Montreal frequently and booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor   rating  Its very nice but well take Trip Advisor ratings with a grain of salt from now on  
P => Warm and welcoming hotel I stayed at the Relais Lyonnais for  nights with my wife and  small children  The hotel more of a bread and breakfast is very well located in the heart of Latin Quarter of Montreal  The first  nights we stayed in the suite on the third floor which was very spacious and quiet  The third night we had to move to the first floor overlooking the street which was a bit noisy  Rooms are very tastefully orated with all sorts of amenities in the room e g  Nespresso but most important was the warmth and hospitality extended by the owners which made us feel at home and patiently attended to our every question  Very good and abundant breakfast was served in the restaurant under the hotel which belongs to the same owners  Highly recommended from a pickly and well travelled person  
P => everything you need if you just need a very comfortable room My dhter and I were in Montreal for the Just for Lhs festival  The hotel is directly across the street from the St Denis Theater and right in the middle of all the festivities  The suite was large very clean and the beds comfortable  Everything you could want was supplied great shower T V  large closets etc  It is a small hotel so no swimming pool or amenities of that sort  The staff was very friendly and the food in the resturaunt downstairs was great and the pastrys out of this world  If you wanted variety in your meals you are in the middle of the latin quarter and there are lots of places to chose from  the only down side if if you have trouble walking there are no elevators and the stairs are steep  the proprietor is pleasent and very helpful  If I find myself in Montreal again its the only place I would stay Jocelyne Speers Victoria B C  
P => Quaint and Friendly My husband and I have stayed at Le Relais Lyonnais a few times and we have always enjoyed our stays there  Albert is very friendly and will help you any way he can  We now request a room at the back since the rooms facing the street can be a little noisy  Besides that everything is great  The rooms are clean and modern the rain shower the little extras e g  espresso machine  The location is in the middle of everything  A  minute walk to Old Montreal a  minute walk to China Town St Catherine street is a block away most festivals are nearby  We park our car and never use it the entire time we are there  I highly recommend staying at this gem of a place Merci beaucoup Albert et   la prochaine  
P => AMAZING Best value best everything To preface I work in tourism  I have been lucky enough to do hotel site inspections on every continent  Honestly Le Relais is one of the  best place Ive ever stayed anywhere in the world  My boyfriend and I loved it so much we asked if we could stay an extra day  I have never done thatAs far as service goes   the innkeeper Albert and his assistants are always cheerfully at your beck amp call  Public amenities include a business center and one of the best French cafes outside of France  Private in room amenities include Nespresso machines with as many cups as you can drink private fridge stocked with water satellite flat panel tv rain showerhead and down pillows and duvet  Bonus   you get red and white wine glasses as well as corkscrew in your room  It is such a pet peeve of mine to have call down for those at a European style hotel or  plus star hotel  The room itself was modern but very homey and comfortable   it didnt have that awful hotel feel of flame retardant carpet and everything bought in bulk  Dark hardwood floors with beautiful shutters comfortable linens and lots of extra towels  It was really like staying at someones house but having total privacy  You can purchase coupons for breakfast in La Brioche at a bargain compared to the menu prices  The food is amazing   very fresh no buffet food ample portions outdoor seating  We ended up eating dinner there as well as it was so good The location was great   right on the lower end of St Denis  blocks from UQAM metro stop  Theres a very posh IGA and Pharmix around the corner for snacks and blister bandages  The hotel is right over the restaurant and on a busy street but the windows are super glazed or something  The rooms are quieter than most skyscraper hotels Ive been in The most amazing thing   the price  Its a bargain for Montreal  You get an incredible local experience at an upscale modern comfortable hotel  Its the best of both worlds I cannot recommend this Le Relais enough  
P => Great value in perfect location  This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very nice  LIke other reviewers I especially liked the espresso machine in the room  Little touches like that made a quotstandardquot room feel quite deluxe Its location on Rue St Denis could not be better UNLESS youre there during the comedy festival  Our room was in the front and it was getting very loud  but then we left IF youre there for the Jazz Festival as we were this is in an excellent location  PROS Upscale everything in the room sheets towels coffee maker  Location  Price  This hotel is very good value for money  Breakfast was included in our room which I didnt expect  That was a nice touch CONS ALl the other reviewers commented on the customer service  We found this to be true during the week less so on the weekends  Several times we couldnt find anyone to answer our questions like what is the code for the wifi  When the owner was there on Monday he was AMAZING as the other reviewers have noted  Either way I would definitely stay there again  
P => Perfect location stylish hotel welcoming owner I stayed at Le Relais Lyonnais with my girlfriend during y   It was a four day trip to Montreal  I truly enjoyed the hotel Some comments  The hotel is very small  I think there were only six rooms  We stayed in room    The hotel is perfectly located on Rue St  Denis in the Latin Quarter  There are many hip bistros restaurants bars and coffee shops along the street  We happened to stay during a comedy festival Just for Lhs and there was a nightly parade right outside the hotel    The room was immaculate  There were several nice details to the room recessed lighting LCD TV Nespresso coffee machine leather chair work desk free and fast wireless Internet down duvet hardwood floor refrigerator free bottled water and rain shower  The room was stylish practical and comfortable    The owner Albert was very friendly and willing to help in any way   The free breakfast in the downstairs bistro was wonderful  I had an omelette one morning and a crepe the other  The breakfast also included cafe au lait orange juice baguette or croissant and fruit   We took the Metro to most places and the hotel is right next to the Berri UQAM metro stop which is the central hub to nearly all of the different colored metro lines  very convenient   There is a free computer and printer on the third floor  It was convenient to print out our boarding passes and also our confirmation for a Gray Line tour to Quebec City  
P => Great Boutique Hotel in Ideal Location This hotel was very unique cozy and charming  It was a great location and had all of those great extra touches you look for in a hotel  The only issue was the room was a little small but it was still cozy and the manager was great    a real gem 
P => Awesome chic little hotel What a great place  Upscale at a perfect price  My wife thought the shower was the best she had ever experienced ever   one of those rain showeresque deals  The location was great for the Jazz Fest  blocks away and the cafe downstairs was very good for croissants for breakfast below hotel  Some nice touches in the very clean room were the nespresso maker free wifi good signal in room  and comfortable chair at the desk  
P => St but not what you  think Firstly these accomodations are exactly what is represented in the photos on the website  Our room was st and very clean and modern with character It sits on top of a caferestaurant offering good standard student type fare the buildings around are mostly student digs on top of commercial properties of all kinds This is a very small establishment unsure of how many rooms but I think less than ten   The host was welcoming and charming The hotel is set right on the street in the middle of an extremely busy area surrounded by Jazz clubs and restaurants and theatre  If you are in a room rather than a suite accommodation is at the front of the establishment and the noise continues until  or  in the morning If this does not worry you then go for it  But if you need some sleep it  not suit  Suites at the rear  be better but we were not able to try one  So my negative recommendation is based on the fact that for three nights I got about  house sleep total over three nights  Not the best way to appreciate a city The four star rating is a puzzle   there is no permanent reception rarely did we see anyone at the front deskwindow after we arrived and it did not seem to have any of the facilities that a four star hotel would regularly offer  Perhaps this falls more into the category of st guest house  
P => THE START OF OUR TH ANNIVERSARY TRIP wow what a gem  thanks to you all who review with TRIP ADVISOR we had the perfect start to our second honeymoon with our stay at this hotel We turned up tired after our flight and were a bit taken aback by how busy the area the hotel was in but were glad to have finally arrived The outside of the hotel is unprepossing but dont let that fool you inside is a little gem The manager was a wonderfully friendly  charming and helpful man The room was of boutique hotel quality The bed was extra king size   enough for  people if wanted  the mattress one of the best Ive ever slept on and the bathroom had a heater which dried all our washing we were in Canada for  month so needed to keep on top of this over night without making the bedroom overly warm Breakfast is served in the quaint cafe under the hotel and even for people like me who cant normally face breakfast shouldnt be missed  Our travel agent tried to point us in the direction of what he thought was a more upket hotel but Im so glad we resisted if this hotel was in London the quality would have put it beyond our purse  Just be waware that the hotel is in the Latin quarter and the lively barsclubs and restaurants make it feel a bit frantic at times but we always felt relaxed   O M G  what a fantastic place Needless to say were planning a return  
P => Fantastic location beautiful room I chose to stay at Le Relais after having read other Tripadvisor reviews  The hotels website is well done and user friendly and I had no trouble booking a room for the dates selected  The hotel is located in the heart of downtown alongside all the cafes and restaurants on Rue St Denis  It looks inconspicuous from the outside and you would easily walk by it if you were just walking on the street  TIP When you walk up the stairs to the hotel there are two doors  and   The entrance is from   But dont try opening the door from the outside as it is locked and you need to be buzzed in  The staff is friendly and helpful and bilingual I believe we spoke French  I stayed at the ground floor room directly overlooking Rue St Denis the hotels ground floor rooms are one level above street level  Initially I was worried about the potential noise from outside but the insulation is great and very little noise filters through  If you can only sleep in complete silence though this  not be the room for you  The room was an immaculately furnished bachelor on the small side but who cares with brick wall LCD TV and a gorgeous bathroom  The bathroom has everything you need including hairdryer  The room was also exceptionally clean  Oh and make sure you try the espresso from their Nespresso machine as it makes for one great coffee in the morning Reception is not open at night so make sure you arrange for everything in advance  The restaurant downstairs is fine but not exceptional  I would definitely return to this hotel in the future  
P => Location service charm My wife and I spent  nights at Le Relais Lyonnaise at teh begining of  and never took the car out of parking  Pleasant walk to everything and the ambiance of the Quartier Latin is vibrant and exciting  Charmingly done room immaculately kept and quiet with abundant light Albert our host could not have been more helpful and informative Breakfast next door at their restaurant La Brioche Lyonnaise is fantastic  
P => A small super clean and ideally located hotel with kind helpful staff  My family and I stayed at this hotel twice once before our trip to Quebec City and afterwards  On both occasions we were allocated the same rooms  They were immaculate  Our flight was delayed by some  hrs resulting in us arriving at some ungodly hour of the night despite our late arrival we were greeted with a kind welcome and a big smile  This hotel is ideally located for anyone seeking the buzz of the Latin Quarter that said Le Relais Lyonnais is surprisingly quiet  We went on to stay in some pretty posh hotels in Quebec City and I still preferred the bathrooms at this hotel  
P => If only every city had a gem like this I am a conductormusical director who spends a lot of time on the road  I arrived in Montreal a few days ago for some R n R between shows  Having spent so much time in chain hotels over the years it was a real breath of fresh air just to walk into the reception of Le Relais Lyonnais What an oasis of stylecomfort and real old fashioned charm The welcome we had from Albertthe owner was irresistible  Within minutes I felt wed been pals for yearsOur suite is adorable It is spaciouscomfortablestylish and luxurious A word of advice   when you come to staywhich you surely must  push the boat out and go for a suite It is well worth it Albert has gone for a real touch of luxury    comfortable bedhigh end beddingflat screen TVespresso machinebathrobesfluffy towelsall the little details   the whole nine yardsThe locationin the very heart of the Latin Quarteris perfect  I am actually writing this in the sitting room of our suitewith the windows openlistening to all the comings and goings in the street belowwhile inhaling the smells from the myriad restaurants in the street I would recommend this hotel to EVERYONE     except the guy who is organising a convention for two hundred Civil ServantsIn a world full of bland production line hotels this little gem is unique and Albert is one one a dying breed of hoteliers who have a genuine passion for hospitality Long  he prosperPS  cant wait to come back 
P => Excellent choice We stayed here for  nights and LOVED IT Great location walking distance about   blocks to either downtown underground or Old Town  Only a few steps from Jazz clubs good eateries relaxing coffee shops     it is actually within the Latin Quarter directly on St  Denis  The room was very spacious we had a suite very clean and lots of nice touches  The towels were very large soft and thick and the bed linens were very good quality  The entire place gave us a st class feeling no cut corners from the bedroom area to the bathroom  We also stayed at Phillips Square and give it high ks too but this place edges it out  I highly recommend both  You park across the street in a garage day but we didnt need the car until we left  The restaurant looked good but we didnt eat there but wouldnt hesitate to if we ended up here at a meal time  The owner very helpful and nice did recommend a place to eat while we were in Old Town and I will too    its called Olive  Guarmando  Just ask anyone down there for directions ALL the locals know the place  Its not fancy but amazingly fresh soup salads sandwiches amp pastries If you are headed to Montreal and want a nice place to stay and try to stay within a budget you will be delighted with this place  
P => Amazing This Hotel is fantastic I have read the reviews and thought it seemed to good to be true  But trust me this hotel is everything it has claimed to be  The staff are fantastic  Location is brilliant   it is right in the thick of things but the bustle is great  Rooms are really lovely ok a bit small but luxurious   and really intelligently updated  From our welcome we were made to feel at home  The owner runs the restraunt below the hotel and is there most days but nothing is too much trouble  Always giving directions or offering advice  The rooms are spotless and the level of or is high  Plus a few nice touchs like free internet  The rates are reasonable when compared with the competition  I could not recommend this hotel highly enough  
P => Terrific stay at Le Relais Lyonnais All the good stuff said on here is true about this small boutique hotel Location is a lot of fun   walking distance to many restaurants the Metro Schwartzs deli to name a few  Jose at reception was very kind   gave me a free breakfast because he said I looked like a nice person The pastries in the restaurant   yummmm  I had the small front room on the first floor room  which is almost on the sidewalk Wasnt that noisy at all slept with no problem  Enjoyed watching the action on the street through the lovely shutters  Room was a bit on the small side but very nice and clean with fridge with bottled water inside coffee maker great shower etc  The next time Im in Montreal I will try to stay here again didnt notice any parking though  There is never anybody at the front desk   when you first arrive just ring the doorbell and somebody will come quickly  Not a big deal   once you check in your room key lets you into the front door of the building as well as your room  Wifi was good  
P => Best location for th birthday   This is the best place to stay if you plan a trip to Montreal The hotel was awesome and it is situated in the heart of everything I stayed there with my husband to celebrate my th birthday and it was really perfect  Everything was very modern and stylish and very clean  The thing we liked best was the breakfast   I put some pictures along   If we visit Montreal again we defenitely will choose the Relais Lyonnaise againNicole and Heinz 
P => In a Class of its own Absolutely amazing cost little boutique Hotel  The room Deluxe was amazingly contemporary with good size LCD TV coffee machine safe etc  Bathroom was a ent size  Rooms were immaculately clean  Location was very good with many many bars and restuarant in St Denis   MIns walk to Old Montreal Albert the owner is a gem   very helpful and polite and most of all Always smiling Highly reccomend this Hotel  
P => Great hotel This is a really great hotel in central montreal  The room itself was really beautiful   very tasteful and modern with an absolutely amazing power shower  We stayed in the room at the front of the hotel which I was expecting to be noisy as it faced the street and the comedy festival was on right outside but it wasnt at all The guy at the front desk was also really friendly and helpful  The only thing Id say is avoid the restaurant downstairs for breakfast   the food isnt great its overpriced and the staff are grumpy  Id recommend Eggs Spectation for breakfast  brunch  Rue St jacques   all things eggs and huge portions 
P => Perfect location lovely hotel This is a lovely little gem of a hotel  Within walking distance of what seemed like hundreds of restaurants and bars the Metro and Vieux Montreal  this area has an awesome energy  The room was small but very lovely  The bathroom was awesome DVD player was a nice touch as we brought some movies to watch on our laptop  The gourmet chocolates are another nice touch As mentioned there is never anyone at the front desk be once out of a dozen times we passed the lobby but we just went down to the restaurant whenever we needed anything and they called someone to meet us at the front desk  
P => Great place I would recommend this hotel  It s in a great location and the room is small but really confortable the bed and the shower are amazing  The lobby is small and the staff usually don t stay there but it is not necessary  We stayed at the second floor at the back and didn t heard any noise  Joanna   Brazil 
P => Great but pick your room carefully Mostly great news  The location is very good particularly for nightlife the staff were always helpful and the rooms are high quality and well furnished with good bathrooms I stayed in a smaller room on the second floor at the back of the hotel on my first of six nights and it was fine  Trying to be thoughful due to the duration of my stay they moved me to a larger room on the ground floor at the front on the second night The room was much larger but there was a constant thud thud of music base through the floor that was noticable from about   am  The basement underneath the bottom floor of the hotel is a restaurant and I figured out that the music was coming from there  I had to go in there once or twice when there was no one on reception as they seem to be run by the same people and the music was certainly very loud  I could hear it in bed in the room with an IPOD onI asked to be moved and they did move me back as soon as they could to my first room which was absolutely fine I would recommend anyone to stay here but to ask for a room either above the ground floor or at the back unless you arent at all sensitive to noise  
P => Great place for World Film Festival We loved this place  Its proximity was unparalleled across the street from eight Film Festival venues  We were there for four nights and three days and saw five great films walked all over central Montreal and biked around a lot farther  The metro was a block away cafes and restaurants were everywhere and the cheerful bilingual innkeeper gave us several great tips including directions to a fine and reasonably priced French restaurant about  minutes away  The Latin Quarter is very youthful and St  Denis gets fashionable yet remains unpretentious to the north  Theres a wonderful sophisticated yet casual quality to Montreal and Le Relais Lyonnais helps epitomize this  Cool espresso machine in room and wifi available in the hall  Well be back 
P => At the heart of everything My sister and I stayed here for four nights during a two week trip to Canada  Booked it based on feedback from Trip Advisor and we were not let down  The location was perfect right in the heart of the latin quarter near excellent restaurants a stones throw from a metro stop and within walking distance of several key attractions and the main shopping street Ste Catherine  The hotels owner Albert is a legend He really made us feel welcome and gave us loads of information that only a local could provide  Food in the cafe beneath the hotel is also excellent  We ate breakfast there on three out of the four days  Top ks all round really  Wed definitely recommend this gem of a hotel to fellow travellers and would stay there ourselves again should we return  And wed love to return 
P => Wonderful stay at Le Relais My husband and I visited this hotelinn at the very end of   I have to thank TripAdvisor for this great find I certainly would not have found it on my own  There is a reason this place is consistently rated as one of the top if not the top hotel in Montreal  That reason is simply Albert  My husband and I like planning weekend getaways  Within driving distance of our home we have a large selection of modern luxurious hotels but the differentiating factor really comes down to service  Albert runs the hotel and greets you with the warmest welcome  It felt like we were visiting a relative that was happy to see us  Albert really goes out of his way to make your stay special  He really understands how to be friendly and helpful without being obtrusive Le Relais Lyonnais only has seven rooms but the size is part of the charm  We had a quiet and peaceful stay  Our room was modern without feeling cold  The shining hardwood floors the luxurious bedding the flat screen TV California shutters and fantastic shower were all within the comfortable yet contemporary tone of this boutique hotel We loved La Brioche Lyonnaise downstairs  We enjoyed two superb breakfasts and late night pastries on the patios of this charming restaurant  The caf  au lait was fantastic The hotel is located in the Quartier Latin  Conservative suburbanites will definitely experience a different vibe while staying in this lively and colourful urban neighbourhood  There was a lot of action in the area but it was nice to retreat to the serenity of Le Relais Lyonnaise at night  We didn t see Albert when we left  I am sure I would have had to hug him  So Albert if you are reading this let this glowing review serve as your  hug   
P => fantastic Here are my thoughts on this great boutique hotel perfect location clean modern rooms The adjoining restaurantpastry shop is fantasic Albert the owner is extremely friendly and helpful   a pleasure to talk to  
P => Extraordinary Find I will not repeat all of the positive comments previously made in the other Trip Advisor reviews  I booked this hotel because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews Just another example that the Trip Advisor reviews are extremely accurate We stayed in a suite overlooking Rue de Saint Denis  No detail has been missed by the proprietor Albert  This suite rivals any I have stayed in  Great bed cool style balcony with seating for two extremely clean rain shower that is better than most spas flat panel TV with international satelite on demand coffeeespresso machine and central location  The only negative aspect I can think of are the steep stairs leading to the upper rooms    but Albert took care of our luggage I will stay at this property again  And to top it off Alberts site and restaurant recommendations were priceless  LISTEN TO HIM  Finally the included breakfast downstairs in Alberts restaurant was always delicious as were the other snacks and meals we enjoyed there 
P => Perfect little hotel Le Relais Lyonnais Hotel is perfect in so many ways  The party is right at your doorstep  The building is quaint and comfortable  The rooms modern and efficient   albeit a little small  Dont be put off by the small lobby  The best part of the hotel is the rooms  Do be aware that management runs the restaurant at street level so the doors are locked and the manager  be in the restaurant if not at the lobby desk  This hotel is not recommended for needy travelers  While management will help you it is more of a self serve place to stay  Definitely recommended  
P => great little place This place is a great small hotel in a very lively area with a lot of small restaurants  the owners are very friendly that recommended a small neighborhood restaurant which we enjoyed very much  The hotel is a kind of boutique hotel with the most amazing shower you have ever felt  I would definitely come back every time I will visit Montreal  If you are looking for a great experience and a warm atmosphere thanks to the owners this is the place to be in Montreal  
P => Good experience a few complaints Booked this hotel after reading such incredibly positive reviews and comments and I cannot disagree with most of them including the wonderful location in the Latin Quarter the clean modern design of the rooms loved the rainfall shower and the warm and accomodating host Albert  However when I checked in I was greeted coldly by a grey haired man who I assumed was Albert but later learned is his assistant who also works with the restaurant downstairs  Make no mistake he is no Albert and they would be well advised to keep him in the kitchen The bed was my biggest complaint the mattress was too soft and I woke up with a sore back every morning  Bed linens and pillows could certainly use an upgrade  Lights in the room fiickered frequently a sign to me that the electrical wasnt updated along with the rooms  Lunch at the restaurant downstairs was nondescript and the waitresses acted like they clearly didnt want to be there  For those with disabilities or who have trouble climbing stairs be aware even those on the first floor will need to navigate one flight of stairs from the main road to the hotel entrance  The second and third floors have a small narrow winding staircase All in all I had a good experience but it was not the incredible stay others have reported  
P => Wonderful Hotel Wonderful Trip We just returned from a fabulous vacation in Montreal thanks to Albert the owner of the Le Relais Lyonnais  This is a small boutique hotel perfectly located in a quothappeningquot part of town known as the Latin Quarter  The or is contemporary the rooms are immaculate the value is excellent and the service is incredible  Our room was a bit petite which will prompt us to consider upgrading to a suite when we visit again Upon arrival Albert basically planned our trip in Montreal     activities restaurants etc  and it could not have been better  He is a happy caring generous gentleman who goes the extra mile time and time again  Our favorite evening was UD at the IMAX theater followed by dinner in a swanky night club type restaurant called Resto LAppartement  But every day and evening was filled with activities including fine food museums shopping and even an exhilirating speedboat trip on the Lachine Rapids One afternoon my husband asked Albert where he could buy some cheese so that we could have wine and cheese in our room  Albert went into the kitchen prepared a beautiful cheese plate for us and refused to let us pay for it  We felt like guests in his home As we were leaving for the airport Albert handed us a bag of croissants from his restaurant to have at the airport  We adored and appreciated Albert so much that we gave him a gift before we left  Its hard to imagine how our trip to Montreal would have turned out without his guidance and his beautiful city made a lasting impression upon us  We look forward to returning to Montreal and staying at Le Relais Lyonnais once more  
P => orServiceLocation Just back from two nights at the Relais Lyonnais  Unassuming location toward the low end of St  Denis but right in the thick of things  Our two room suite was BEAUTIFUL  Great privacy for a family with a  year old  velous quotrainshowerquot  Even had a terasse at the back The staffpatron was very accomodating and solicitous of our welfare Great little cafe downstairs affiliated with the hotel  Breakfast crepes etc  and first class pastries all day  
P => Perfect perfect perfect I agree I have never felt so compelled to write a review and without trip advisor we never would have found such a gem  Fantastic location lively Latin Quarter short walk to Vieux Montreal close to Metro lovely modern room great breakfast downstairs and the owner Albert was so incredibly helpful and charming  Will not even consider staying anywhere else in Montreal 
P => A stay like no other We stayed on the nd floor  which is an over sized room thanks to an extended sitting room that includes a couch which converts into a bed a coffee table and a very cool lamp  The room overlooks St  Denis directly in front of a movie theater  It is beautifully orated with contemporary appointments including but not limited to modern fixtures a flat screen LCD a very hip espresso maker and a shower the likes of which youll seldom see elsewhere  There is a balcony but its inaccessible without serious effort and perhaps not intended for use We booked our stay to include breakfast   take note that this was no ordinary breakfast in the quotcontinentalquot mode but one served in the restaurant just below the hotel  It happens to also bear the similarities of the hotels name and ownedoperated by the same proprietors  The restaurant is excellent for any meal and breakfast is no exception  Wonderful eggs and crepes amazing juices fresh fruit and yes amazing pastries  The portions are fair and the service excellent  This added benefit proved a truly a fantastic place to start your day  Contributing mainly to the appeal of this hotel is Albert the owner  He is an incredible bilingual help in terms of recommendations general advice and overall assistance  He  made  our trip to Montreal  My wife had a minor medical issue for which he helped facilitate a dors house call  He is charming morning and night and treats his guests like family members staying at his own home  No reasonable request will be denied and he is wont nickel and dime you for incidental benefits like complimentary bottled water Internet access etc  The evening attendant is also a very nice man Stephan and helpful in English or French  As for my personal view on how to make your potential stay more enjoyable  Dont hesitate to engage Albert for any of your traveling needs  He is a lovely person and wont steer you wrong for restaurants site seeing or passing time  If possible refrain from dealing with Alberts partner Jose   he isnt exactly polished in quite the way Albert is   they clearly did not attend the same client relation classes  My belief is that Jose is more on the restaurant business side of things better suited and accustomed to dealing with croissant inventory than he is for example procuring a foam mattress for bed sensitive sleepers   If you are the least bit distracted by downtown street noise stay away from any of the rooms that face St  Denis  Keep in mind there is a price to pay for staying on such a vibrant street which includes homeless beggars that can annoy you bilingually  Arrive earlier than say night fall  This will ensure that a you have Albert receive you and b you actually find the hotel  The hotel door is alway locked  When you buzz in youre actually buzzing the restaurant downstairs for someone to come up  This  seem strange at first but its no big deal and good for security  Once you check in your room key will also serve as the hotel door key  This is a small hotel   it is a building that was converted so it is small  The lobby wont shock and awe you so dont feel weird when you arrive   your room will more than make up for it In conclusion the best aspects of the hotel The room the shower   did I mention that already I did  Ill mention it again    Albert and the breakfasts The only quotgotchasquot I would warn about are a street noise but then again you wanna stay in the middle of things then you already know that and b the couch in the over sized rooms that convert into beds are of the bare minimum variety in terms of comfort  If there are  of you to a room make sure the rd wheel sleeps easy  On a side note my mother was the rd wheel in our case and had a terrible nights sleep on the very thin couch mattress   Albert stepped in immediately and gave her a complimentary room of her own because of a booking opening for one of the nights  Just another example of Alberts action oriented customer service philosophy  
P => Fabulous I discovered this hotel through the raves on Tripadvisor com and can attest it deserves the stellar rating  We stayed in a third floor suite and were surprised to find we had a huge private balcony that made us feel like we were living in the neighborhood rather than renting a hotel room  This is a cozy townhouse hotel but unlike a BampB it feels totally private  We never heard another guest the housekeeping staff is both meticulous and virtually invisible and the hotel owner could not have been more gracious  He ran out and paid our parking meter while we unloaded our luggage and hooked us up with a reservation at a nearby French restaurant that my husband is still raving about weeks later Leloux  The room itself was modern and sleek  Comfortable bed great shower And te bakery downstairs is to die for  
P => Simply Perfect My husband and I just returned from a  day stay at Le Relais Lyonnais  We travel quite a bit and I have never felt so compelled to write a review  This boutique hotel has been beautifully restored yet retains the original character of the building  The location is perfect as the Latin Quarter is lively and has much to offer and it is a short walk to Old Montreal the greatest shopping areas and restaurants  The rooms particularly the suites on the rd floor are spacious appointed beautifully and the bed is perfect is retire to after a long day of walking shopping and eating  The service to make up your room is early in the day and never intruding  The rooms are spotlessly clean and very trendy with flat screen TVs and a great espresso machine  As if all of that wasnt enough to top it off there is the owner Albert  Albert will welcome you as if you are a member of his family and his favorite family member at that He is a GREAT guy with a warm personality and wonderful friendly smile  He sincerely cares and spares nothing to ensure that your experience stands out  He succeeds to the fullest extent There is a wonderful cafe below the hotel that seems to be open all the time and Albert will be the first to set you up with a something to eat and drink upon arrival  We truly felt like Albert was an old friend taking quotspecialquot care of us and we thoroughly enjoyed talking with him  With this type of personal attention and care taken in every aspect of your stay what else could you ask for Oh and if you need a shirt perfectly pressed and returned to your room in no time at all   it wont be a problem at this exceptional hotel  
P => Great boutique hotel a little noisy We loved what we saw when we walked into our room  This was the hotel I had most been looking forward to during our one month stay of USCanada based on TripAdvisor reviews Loved the or and the large shower  The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter and there are a lot of students in the area  At night it can be quite noisy with people walking by yelling  We stayed for  nights and had a room right next to the street  It would be worth asking for a room at the back of the hotel if possible Our first night was quite disruptive as the people above us had a party until am  We could hear every word spoken and every footstep taken  The second night was better but there was still the street noise  If not for the street noise and party noise I would not be able to fault this hotel  I know they cannot be blamed for the noise but this forms part of my overall opinion and sticks in my mind  
P => my new home in montreal i was recently in montreal for my first visit and had the pleasure to stay at Le Relais THIS HOTEL is why tripadvisor works  Without this web site i would never have found this little jewel  I travel all over the world and this was one of the best stays i have ever had the room was great the position excellent and the price fantastic  If you are looking for all the bells and whistles of a big hotel then forget it  But if you want a great location a modern clean and VERY comfortable room the best hotel shower since the Grand Hyatt Tokyo and the MOST personable and friendly service then this is the place for you Alert is a king not only did he make me at home but after discovering this was my first time in montreal he was on the phone to a friend and had organised me a door pass at one of the best restaurantbars in town The position is great with restaurants and shops around and only a short ten minute walk to the old town or downtownAnd if you cant be bothered walking then just go downstairs to Alberts and Joses restaurant outside   a really great and homely feel to it with good food at great prices  but be warned breakfast starts at  am Le Relais is DEFINATELY my new home in Montreal 
P => Loved this place           This place was wonderful    very very clean and comfortable and the location is great    I would return to this establishment in a heartbeat  
P => Look No Further We stayed  nights at this beautiful romantic hotel  It was very clean modern and very tastefully orated  The top  reasons that anyone going to Montreal should consider staying here are  The location is great Its right there in the Latin Quarter on the rue St  Denis near great restaurants shopping and the Metro  Rue St  Denis runs by the university and is brimming with life   Albert who owns the hotel with his brother is warm generous and made us feel very welcome  Just a genuine sincere human being   The bed and linens were so comfortable it was hard to get up in the morning  That is saying a lot as we are typically early risers  Which leads to the last point   The incredible rainfall showerhead combined with above average water pressure apparently a major consideration when the hotel was being reated made it just that much easier to drag ourselves out of bed  By the time we finished our showers we were energized enough to run a athon Seriously we are now trying to figure out how to recreate that shower at home  We will definitely be back in Montreal and when we come this is where we will stay  Highly recommended  
P => Really great experience We stayed for a few nights over ch break and although the Montreal weather was not the best the room more than made up for that  The staff were very friendly and accomodating especially when there was a small problem with the hot water   no big issue though  The hotel is located right on St Denis close to theatre metro food and drinks   short walk to Old Montreal and downtown Price was good and the suite was just as it looks on the website    really clean and contemporary We would definately stay here again     in the summer 
P => Georgeous stay at Relais Lyonnais  Jason and I stayed at the Relais Lyonnais on ruary nd  in the deluxe suite and enjoyed every moment of it Georgeous room with a perfect location  The welcome was very nice and the people too La Brioche Lyonnaise was also amazing    very good food    luved it Thanks again for the wonderful stay  Jays amp Clo 
P => Perfect Location   Perfect Host   a bit noisy We stayed three nights in the Relais Lyonnais  The room fulfilled what was promised on the Internet  The only draw back and blessing at the same time is it perfect location in the rue St Denis  At Fridays and Saturdays night it was quite noisy but with the windows closed we slept quite well  All in all we liked it and will come back if we will visit Montreal again  
P => Great Location Fantastic Service We stayed at this hotel for our first anniversary and what a second honeymoon it was In the middle of Rue St  Denis in the heart of Montreals Latin Quarter close to all kinds of restaurants and little shops and two blocks from the subway the location cant be beat  The staff was friendly and very helpful willing to assist us with everything from sightseeing to taxis  We arrived at  in the morning on a Friday and our room was ready  It is important to say that there is not a person at the front desk at all times but we rang the front door bell and never had any problems  The hotels door is locked at all times so the room key is also the front door key The room was small but really modern and clean  Strategically placed mirrors give the impression of more space  The high def TV was a nice surprise  The bathroom was very impressive with an enormous shower though no bathtub  We stayed on the first floor and it was a bit noisy at night with music coming from nearby clubs but we really didnt mind We are planning to go back to Montreal and definitely planning to stay here again  
P => Looking forward to a return visit Having been to Montreal a few times over the past  months I am always looking for a unique place to stay  My husband is a devotee of Trip Advisor and found this boutique hotel for me for the last weekend in   Everything that I read on TA was verified  The room was comfortable and immaculate   the linens crisp and the room surprisingly quiet for the fabulous St Denis location  When I called to make the reservation I asked for a recommendation for a bakery   I need birthday cake ready upon my arrival   Albert told me that their cafe downstairs would make it for me  As promised it was ready and one of most beautiful cakes I had ever seen  The students at McGill who enjoyed it claimed it to be one of the best   I rented a car and the convenient indoor parking wih unlimted in and out benefits is a real plus  I must have used in  times in the  days  Street parking is tough to say the least  My only recommendation is to really MAPQUEST the location because if you arrive as I did at  pm on a Sat night the street is mobbed and it is easy to pass the hotel  I also ate in the cafe one evening and the food was good and service perfect  I look forward to returning to this hotel on future visits  
P => Great Boutique I have been staying here a few days  This place is a gem the price was good and they upgraded us to suites for no chargeVery clean and minimalist  The place looks just like the photos  Its like being in a West Elm or Pottery Barn catalog shoot  And I mean that in a good way  The rooms are very stylish and comfortable  The bathrooms are wonderful  The towels are the thickest and fluffiest I think I have ever had at a hotel  The bed is firm and comfortable  The staff is very helpful and friendly  The location in the Latin Quarter cant be beat this area has the groovy feel of Amsterdam with tons of international restaurants and alternative lifestyles  Its just a half a block from the Metro  The cafe downstairs serves good breakfasts  This is a great place to stay  I wonder why they have a problem being fully booked 
P => great little hotel What a great little hotel this is I got on the net because I was to stay one night in Montreal and wanted to be somewhere characteristic and close to everything  After having read the reviews on tripadvisor I ided to book online through the hotels own website  I paid just over  canadian and can guarantee that it is worth every penny  I took the bus from the airport to the centre of town and then a free shuttle took me to the hotel by the way not many people know it so say you are going to the St Denis Theatre if you are catching a taxi  When I arrived the guy at the counter asked me about my travel and where I came from etc  He was very polite and gave me an upgrade I think in view of the slow season following the festivities and of the hotel being half empty  I got a fabulous suite  The room is clean very spacious bedroom with two armchairs and a desk then arate room with sofa and coffee table has a flat screen TV satellite and I think a DVD player too   complimentary coffee and water as well as chocolate by the bedstand  It has a fridge no mini bar an ironboard ent closet space the bathroom has an amazing shower and is equipped with a hairdrier and a mini heater which is grand  There were tonnes of towels All soft and very very quotproprequot  The or is a mix between Swedish and Japanese styles and you can tell the reation has been carried out by a architect  The bed was as comfortable as one can ask for   to me that is the most important thing along with cleanliness  The room is airconditioned you can set the temperature and it has lights with dimmers all round  It is right in the centre of the Latin quarter so its perfect for a night out there are so many nice places just on the same street  I got back after am and was a little frightened I might hear noises from the road but the windows must be double glazed because I really didnt hear a thing  I dont think it has a lift which is a bit of a downer but I carried my heavy suitcase downstairs when I checked out no problem they carried it for me when I checked in  I left it with them so that I could carry on my explorations and they offered to call a taxi for me which promptly arrived at the given time  It is about ten minutes walk from the old part of town and ditto for downtownbusiness district but wouldnt suggest walking it if its too cold outside  There is a metro station across the road so that is handy All in all it was a great experience and I would definitely go back to the same place if I was ever to visit Montreal again  Excellent value for money and it feels good to be outside the main hotel circuits and in a small place where people know your name  Thumbs up 
P => Des Joyeuses Fetes Thank you Albert and Le Relais Lyonnais  You made up for one of the worst holiday travel experiences Ive ever had I live in San Francisco and was meeting my East Coast family in Montreal for the holidays  Look ahead  cancelled flight  broken down bus  lost bag and  hours later and I practically face planted into the huge bed waiting for me  Our room was beautiful the shower successfully washed a days worth of travel stress away and Albert made sure I didnt have to worry about a thing for the next week  Complimentary Christmas croissants a full list of restaurants open for Christmas dinner and directions to the nicest ski resort I could ever trip down the bunny slopes at  I cant wait to come back to Montreal now   in the summer  
P => How do you say SUPERB in French My family traveled to Montreal for the first time this past Christmas and stayed at the Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais  We have been spoiled and on future trips to this lovely city will not stay anywhere else The hotel is just beautiful and it is maintained perfectly by the staff the rain shower mentioned by other reviews is truly divine after a long day of traveling or sightseeing  The personal touches added by Albert however are what make this travel experience a stand out He was able to answer all of the questions we had as first time visitors   the best skiing the place for midnight mass and the locations of the best shops He even managed to leave a traditional quotYule logquot in the refrigerator of our room as a Christmas gift Montreal has many wonderful sights to see and our family will be back but only when Albert tells us that he has rooms available THANKS FOR EVERYTHING Sharon in Atlanta 
P => Beautiful room great location The the room suite was extremely beautiful and well oratedthe bathroom was also very quotdesignquot and convenientthe location on rue Saint Denis is really good and the room was not noisy even if on the streetthe owner of the hotel a french guy is very nice and helpfulthe cleaning service is excellentThe    no elevator so not that convenient with huge luggages When we arrived at the hotel the lobby was closed and we had to go to the restaurant same owner behing the hotel to ask someone to open the door  Also there were not someone very often at reception because it is a small hotelConclusion a quotsecret hotelquot that deserves to be discovered as the room is really luxurious and well orated for a reasonable price  This hotel with excellent location is the perfect place for independant travellers who dont need a very dedicated reception office  
P => A gem in the Latin Quarter As other guests have stated the hotel is fantastic  A small boutique type hotel in the heart of the Latin Quarter  I arrived very late as my flight was delayed  hours and ended up getting to the hotel at am  I had contacted the hotel earlier and Albert had left the key in the mail box  The room is fantastic dark hardwood floors exposed brick a firm mattress that was so comfortable flat screen plasma TV and a rain shower in the bathroom I think that was the best touch  I didnt get to spend much time in the room but at  it is a steal and I would definitely stay again  
P => A Gem I stayed  nights at this small boutique hotel in the French Quarter  The room was immaculate with beautiful hardwood floors comfortable bed and linens  The bathrrom was spacious with a luxurious shower  I highly recommend it   
P => Loved the rooms Wonderful large suite  Large well equipped bathroom  Best shower ever  Very quiet even though we overlooked the street  Helpful personel  Brought ice or anything else we needed Central location  Would stay there again and recommend it highly  
P => Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais Gorgeous Le Relais Lyonnais is a gorgeus place to stay not only because it is a very nice hotel in a brownstone located in the center of Montreal or because the modern and stylish rooms with de luxe amenities are very clean and comfortable or for the excellent quotla brioche Lyonnaisequot located in the basement of the hotel with its delicious breakfast and deserts but above all for the warm welcome of Mr  Albert the owner who with his kindness made everything possible to make our stay unforgettable  If you are planning a visit to Montreal you should not miss this small piece of heaven on earth 
P => Great Little Hotel We have just returned from a stay in the Hotel Relais Lyonnais in Montreal  Its rated  star but dont let that fool you  Its a small gem of a hotel  Upon arrival we were met and welcomed by Albert who wore a smile as though it were part of his uniform  He came to the curb where we parked our car in front of the hotel and fed the meter so we could unload register and check out our room  For an extra  a day strongly suggested the hotel provides secure underground parking in a carpark a short distance from the hotel  You are given a swipe card and this allows you to enter and leave the facility as often as you like but since we were in town for only two days we did not feel the need to use the car once it was parked We were given a street side room and were surprised at just how quiet it was  The room itself was very stylish with a very comfortable queen bed fridge very ample closet space a ent sized flat screen TV and a bathroom my wife would like to duplicate in our next home  Both of us enjoyed the large shower with its rainforest showerhead and the scented towels  We also enjoyed looking out the large bay window to see the activity on the street  The only negative I can think of is that the room was a bit on the small side  Nevertheless it was a fine room and we would go back to the Relais on our next visit to Montreal  
P => Excellent Hotel We had quickly ided to just pick up and go to Montreal for a few days and were recommended to stay at the Le Relais Lyonnais  A friend of ours had stayed there in y and had nothing but excellent things to say about it  And he was right Albert the owner is so gracious humble and hospitable  He made our stay even more enjoyable  The hotel is so quaint and beautiful   just what we wanted   something small and intimate but in the middle of everything  The location was great   we were able to walk everywhere   beautiful Old Montreal is only a  minute walk away  And the Metro subway station is just around the corner from the hotel  The suite we stayed in was beautifully orated   very simple clean modern lines  It also had a terrace which overlooked St  Denis the Latin Quarter  I also couldnt get over just how clean the room was   I dont think Ive ever been in such a clean hotel room including the  star hotels weve stayed in  Every time we visit Montreal now I will definitely stay at the Le Relais Lyonnais  
P => European charm in the heart of Montreal This tiny nook of a hotel is a little hard to find if you arent familarily with the streets of Montreal but it is definitely worth the effort  Located in the trendy latin quarter of Montreal the hotel does not have a large walk up like you would find in larger hotels and you  have difficulty finding parking in front of the hotel    but this is the price you pay for being in the centre of everything  The hotel is up the street from the University of Quebec at Montreal and is close to a metro station  There is a wide variety of restaurants literally steps away from the hotel not taking into account that there is a very nice restaurant attached to the Relais Lyonnais  You are about  minutes walking distance from the old port of Montreal and about  minutes away from all of the shops of Ste Catherine Street This hotel is a labour of love  The rooms are very tastefully orated and the pictures on the website offer a tantalizing peek at what to expect  The bed are memory foam style mattresses and the duvets are thick and comfortable not like the starchy polyester like duvets that you are accustomed to in most hotels  The flatscreen television has access to Bell Expressvu but given that you are in the heart of the latin quarter you probably wont watch it much  We stayed in a suite and the couch in the other room is actually a pull out bed  Combined with the sliding doors this is a viable second room  The bathroom was beautifully orated but there could have been a little more counter space  Although this was an issue for my girlfriend the shower more than made up for this inconvenience  The hotel staff namely Albert and Jos  are very friendly and made our stay very pleasant  Ive seen some comments that they are not always at the desk but you will be able to find someone in the restaurant downstairs to help you  All in all it is a minor inconvenience and the service they provide is excellent The only point that I would raise is that St  Denis is a very popular street and there is a lot of street noise if you are staying in a suite  Having said this the noise is no different than what you would expect from a hotel in the middle of a vibrant city and the location makes up for any inconvenience I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fun place to stay in Montreal  
P => Well located boutique hotel Got this off Tripadvisor at the last minute  Location is great at the bottom end of St Denis  We stayed two nights in one of the suites complete with lounge and terrace  Very lovely rooms and a fab monsoon shower  Owner was very friendly although there isnt really any service as such its so small but someone will come up from the restaurant below if you really need it

P =>  sleepless nights So It was said that I d have a kitchnete adn I had it but thingk about trailer park kitchen and you can get the idea  NO ice trays in the fridge and no ice machine in the   hotel   plus you have to pay extra  to have dishes doneI always travel on a budget but I have never been in a hotel where there where  human hairs waiting for me in the bath tube Them the corridors are covered in tytle therefore any woman wearing heels seemed to be stomping inside my bedroom Being a cheap hotel atracts a cheap clientele that has no respect for other people s need to rest and they come yieling and screaming at any hour and the staff doesn t bother to do something I have no idea how it is rated  stars as evrything is so run down Internet use is trough a cable that you have to pick up at the front deskIt just goes from bad to worse 
P => Good for the price No complaints  An awful lot of furniture in the room and a ceiling fan would be nice  Staff location amenities cleanliness all fine  Nothing fancy not quotquaintquot or even really modern but a good place for the price  
P => Very Clean  I really dont know what people are talking about  This Hotel is perfect Very clean excellent location amp never experienced any problems  Its walking distance to many attractions amp the quotMetroquot subway  I would definately go back  
P => The hotels name should be  How much money can we take you for  I should have listened to the other reviewers here  This place is terrible  From the start Get to the hotel and check in  I have to pay for parking  a night plus tax  Fine whatever thats  plus tax which I know is something like   here   hotel tax   for goods and services GST and    for the Quebec sales tax  Then I get something faxed to me and they tell me when I go to pick it up that its  cents per page plus tax What Even copying sheets at the library is only  cents a page so why  cents Is there a paper shortage in Montreal Ok so I ask about the internet and am told I need an ethernet cable  They say theyll provide me one and that it is free  Fine  So I checked my bank account online today and I see a charge for  dollars    I havent use room service or anything like that and even with the parking and the   for the  sheets of paper and tax that does not equal  dollars  So I just went to the front desk and asked about it  They deny putting the charge there and say they only charge a  dollar security fee and that at the end of the stay it will be taken off  Only there is no  dollar security fee on my account just this unaccounted for  dollar charge    Stay as far away from this place as you can  I was walking to the hotel about  feet away from the entrance and there was a used condom on the ground  BAD PLACE TO STAY  Money grubbing facetious staff and poorly maintained rooms cracks in the floor hole in the counter  At least we photographed the stuff so they shouldnt be able to charge us anything  Im sure they will try though  Also long term construction is going on right next to the hotel  Looks like theyre erecting a new building and are just in the foundation pouring phase  Its sad when you spend your trip on vacation awaiting your return home  Thats just pathetic  These people should be ashamed of themselves  
P => Amazing Hotel My best friend and I stayed at Le Roberval for a long weekend     Our rooms was great full kitchen large fridge stoveover microwave sink cupboards with potspansplates dining table in kitchen  The bathroom was basic but VERY clean  The only downside was the fact that we were expecting two beds but there was only one in the room which didnt bother us at all since were close friends  This hotel does not have the quottypical tacky orquot seen in most cheaper hotels     the bedroom had an exposed brick wall and a wrought iron bedframe very quoteuropeanquot look to it  The staff were very friendly the free breakfast was basic but good  Another big plus about this hotel is that it is downtown a very short walk to the nightlifeclubsbarsrestaurants  I would definitely return to this hotel 
P => Dont believe the bad reviews    its FINE I dont know what these people are complaining about  Le Roberval is a   star hotel and is much nicer than most other hotels with that rating  For night we got a spacious suite with living room bedroom kitchenette bathroom with tub and balcony  It also included high speed internet wired breakfast and parking  It was clean relatively comfortable and the service was fine  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to stay close to the village  Its an easy  minute walk  Its also an easy  minute walk to the old town  Just be aware that the parking lot is off site  Its across the street and the parking garage is very small and scary  I didnt mind but I wouldnt recommend women traveling alone to use the garage  
P => Absolutely Terrible   Spend the Extra Money and Never Stay Here This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  I stayed here with  friends at the end of ust of   We loved the idea of the family suites where we could all stay in the same unit together  We should have went with two rooms at a Best Western When we go there we were immediately a little disappointed   the room was very dim and not as large as advertised  Only one bathroom as well  The floor was cold and the bathroom didnt steamed up very quickly  Since we thought we were getting a good deal we let that slide  The next day we realized that staff didnt come and clean the rooms once again we let that slide  We asked for more towels none came  Let that one slide too  We were in Montreal having a good time and didnt want the hotel to ruin it  We checked out at the end of our trip and thought that would be the end of it About a week after we left my credit card was charged for an extra  dollars  After calling the hotel I was informed that this was fora a  dollar charge for leaving dishes in the sinkb a  dollar charge for a leak in the bathroom Now if you were paying  dollars for three nights at a hotel room would you not expect that if you left a few cups in the sink that would be alright We saw no documentation of this charge As for the leak in the bathroom we had been having troubles with our toliet for the entire stay and had mentioned this to them on check out but alas that doesnt matter apparently  When I called them they repeatedly denied that we told them about the leak or that there was no documentation of the dish rule present in the rooms  Ive found their staff very difficult to deal with and would never recommend this hotel to anyone Spring for one of the other hotels in the area  The rooms will be nicer the service better and you wont wind up with a whole lot of stress after your vacation  
P => Super value Very clean and large room  Good location near interesting attractions  Very good breakfast  
P => Ok for the price We drove from NYC for an Independence Day vacation stayed for  nights  Overall if you did some traveling in large cities you know that you cant expect anything special from night hotel  You get what you pay for   basic and hopefully no nosense service Good things about Roberval location   couple of block walk to Rue St Denis and the rest of Latin Quarter colorful restaurantsshopping  min drive to Old City rooms   we had a clean suite w kitchen tiny bedroom and sofapull down bed in another room breakfast   fresh and nice croissants bagels coffee fruit salad no problem service   rooms cleaned garbage taken towels changed sheets changed girls downstairs always friendly  Kitchen was Ok   gas oven fridge no dirty plates or pots as others wrote even though we brought our own little pot   just in case  Oh had we known that smoker rooms had balconies we would have opted for one Not so good underground parking  is in the building accross the streetaround the corner   very annoying bc you do need a car to move around Montreal not exactly a tiny city TV   old tiny hardly visible  louzy channels half French view   on the parking or a street nothing to write about  
P => Better than expected   I stayed there for a night with wife and  kids  Room was small but clean and kitchen had all basic appliances  The bed was in a arate room  The kids slept on the sofa bed when of those that open up  Internet access was complimentary with excellent speed but required an Ethernet cable no Wi Fi  Breakfast was and excellent and also complimentary  There is also a computer in the lobby anyone can use  Parking costs day  You  park for free overnight on a back street until am  Hotel location is very convenient and close to many attractions  Staff at front desk was very friendly and helpful  This hotel was great deal for the money  Definitely recommended for budget travelers  
P => some glitches but ironed out over all a good value but webooked it thru the quebec wayside booth and found they had wanted  extra for our dhter to stay even though we had a reservation printed for  i insisted we hold firm and they did that but what a hassle entering after a long drive and getting the stonewall there not professional  the night staff  we liked the clean rooms but were upset that the kitchen was there and that we had to clean the cups and coffee maker or not get our  usd deposit back good location for the village old port and china town the metro is right behind  oh and the parking is very compact so if you are bigger truck use another lot good breakfast and coffee 
P => Not a bad hotel for the price Overall stay was a pleasant one  The staff were helpful and friendly We booked our hotel in Montreal this time based on price and location we were heading to the Jacques Villeneuve circuit the next day and kept in mind that it was only going to be used for one night to lay our heads  This was a good choice for that  It is in the vicinity of the University of Quebec and must have been residences during the school year or something because each room was a mini suite that came with a arate bedroom and bathroom from the kitchen and living room area  We ended up having to switch rooms  times because the first room had no working air conditioning and the second room had the same plus there was work being done to the stove and kitchen area they should have really check on this room before we tried it  Once we got settled into our third room it was deemed satisfactory a working airconditioner appliances and clean bathroom  The TV remote needed a change in batteries but then again we were not spending lots of time there Outside the building was a little shady in that the buildings around it were a little dilapitated and when you walked up to St  Catherine street there were quite a few homeless people close by  But being at the corner of Beri St and Rene Levesque we were very close to shopping on St Catherine St St Denis St  and St Laurent where there are many great cafes and restaurants to choose from  One restaurant on St Catherine we enjoyed was called De Giovannis where they served awesome pasta  They must make it fresh daily and you should see the meatballs Here is a review httprestomontreal carestaurantsindex phpsection viewrestoampresto id ampshow ratingsamplang enWe only paid  for the night and got a huge continental breakfast included with the price in the basement floor of their building in a little cafe restaurant  Served was juice and coffee hotcold cereal yogurt real Montreal bagels with jam or cream cheese toast fruit salad muffins  A real tasty treat first thing in the morning Advice dont settle ont he first room you get there are also hotels int he area like the Hotel Lord Berri and another around the corner that are all part of the same company but I think a slight bit more expensive  
P => good value We crossed the border from the States into Canada and called at the Tourist info  They were very helpful and booked us into this hotel  We were a little worried about the distance from the centre and the external appearance  However once inside we were pleasantly suprised helpful reception  Our room came complete with fully equipped kitchen the room was basic but very clean and a good size  The walk into central Montreal was fine  
P => Great Location and Price I have stayed at Le Roberval on two occasions and have a reservation for a weekend in ember  The hotel is located in the Latin Quartier near the UQAM Berri subway  The suites are nice with hardwood floors exposed brick walls and plenty of windows and nice little kitchenettes  Most recently my bedroom was located on the front of the bldg but it was quiet since the rooms are soundproofed with double windows  I used to stay at the Gouverneur Place Dupuis just down the street and the prices there just keep escalating  Le Roberval also has apts for those who need a place for longer stays  I highly recommend this establishment for the great location price and friendly staff  
P => Nice hotel Great Location Hi i recently stayed at the Hotel Le Roberval ust    The place had good value for your money  The rooms were comfortable and clean  The kitchenette didnt have a lot of plates and such but was good enough  The hotel is located in a good area close to many of the popular streets  The area was safe  there was no hesitation to walk around at night  I would reccomend the hotel and plan on returning  
P => Not too bad Ive stayed at Le Roberval twice most recently in il   Lots of good things about it  The location is outstanding its on a quiet corner yet is only one long block from the busiest Metro station in Montreal and walking distance to the lively Quartier Latin to the north and even Chinatown to the west  I believe all the rooms are studios   roomy with kitchenettes including a large refrigerator  The staff is very pleasant and helpful  Its not perfect    towels were very worn and linty for example    but if you can get a good rate its an excellent value

P => clean and good pricegood locationNot as bad as the reviews I stayed this Hotel for one week what I found was a very clean room and clean sheets and clean pillows on the bed and a very clean bathroom  The hotel staff was very nice and accommodatingthey prepared the breakfast at  am everyday for me when I told them i must to attend my meeting before am        In fact I didnt find any bed bugs  
P => The germs you cant see BED BUGS    stay awayAVOID THE TORMENT I WENT THROUGH BECAUSE OF CONTRACTING BED BUGS FROM THE SAINT MALO MONTREAL  AVOID THIS HOTEL The Saint Malo Montreal has a huge BED BUG problem  There are many reviews about it just like mine I stayed here and was very disappointed with the cleanliness  I had bed bug bites all over me see sample photos attached  Bed bugs can be a major disturbance and cost you thousands to exterminate if you take them home  You  end up throwing out some of your favorite clothing  Dont risk it  The worst part about it was they would not admit there were bed bugs in the room  They played dumb  Very unprofessional  It cost me a lot of money to treat all my clothing and remove the BED BUGS  THE BED BUGS BITES STAYED ON MY FACE FOR NINE DAYS  
P => Clean and Comfortable Pretty Good Location The room is small but its very clean and cozy  the whole environment is so quiet and comfortable with free breakfast of huge the room charge is very reasonable  Especially the location we can get to St catherina street which is main shopping and resto street in montreal just in  minutes on foot  And the staff is so friendly good experience 
P => Dirty and uncomfortable I don t usually write hotel reviews but really have to warn you for this one The first thing we noticed entering the cramped room in the basement was the smell  Then the stains on the bed covers and carpet followed by the dust and mould in the corners  We asked for another room but they looked even worse  As the helpful desk clerk explained ours was  De Luxe  With no time to look for another hotel we checked for bed bugs found none   just some spiders   and reluctantly ided to stay Everything in the room was neglected and dysfunctional  The closet was about to fall apart and just taking up some of the limited space left around the two beds  The sink fell off the wall if you touched it   we learned not to do that  The bath tub floor made sounds indicating that some muddy substance was under it although it didn t come out  The remote control batteries were blank and several light bulbs were blown  The table fan turned on but didn t move sideways  The ice bucket held dust  A spilled colored substance   long dried up   smeared the inside of the shared refrigerator in the hallway The room had no air conditioning  The central ventilation system gave a weak flow after the kind desk clerk cranked it up but most of the time did nothing  The room had two windows  One opened to the street at foot level so we kept it closed  The other opened to an alley but turned out to be the source of the stench coming from the kitchen of a nearby restaurant  Only late in the evening the window could be opened for heat control After a rainy night a car in the alley drove through a puddle splashing a wave of water through the window over my wife and the book she was reading  It was so absurd that we finally had a good lh about it I ve travelled a lot in Europe North America Brazil and Asia  This was the worst hotel I saw in  years  
P => Complete Dump In Trashy Part Of Town This place is a complete Dump  It tells you it has onsight parking but that is a lie you have to park down the street in a very unsecure and very unsafe looking car park  It only got worse as me and my boyfriend went in the room  It was tiny and looked nothing like the photograohs online  The bed was all crooked and tiny you cannot call it a double  Never stay here  We checked in then an hour later we checked out and went to the otel where we had a brilliant sat for only  extra a night  
P => clean friendlygood price This hotel is small but the room is very clean   a small  floor    room hotel with small rooms with no elevator  However we had a great stay there  The staff was very friendly and the property was immaculate  Free Continental breakfast of hugeand the price is very reasonable  
P => Worst place ever Worst stay ever Bed bugs everywhere  bathroom isnt cleaned at all  THe towels are always dirty even when they are replaced they are replaced with dirty ones  Never changed the bed sheets staff is indifferent to the hygiene of their hotel  Drawers have weird stains on them  Staff is annoying they do not understand english well  Breakfast is a joke its really a joke  I thought this was a hotel from the pictures turns out its a craphole  BED BUGS  i got large red bumps all over my body starting the second day   very horrible place go at your own risk 
P => dirty and poor service First off upon entering our first room we were immediately disgusted by the stained bedspread after taking it off we noticed that the sheets and pillows were covered with hair  The shower was gross and clearly not cleaned  I would not step in it without sandals  After speaking with the extremely rude woman at the desk she explained that no hotels wash their blankets in between customers and we should not have expected it  We finally had to switch rooms which was only a mild improvement  The ice bucket was very dirty and we couldnt use it  While looking for my phone charger under the bed I found a used condom wrapper  The complimentary breakfast consisted of stale donuts stale croissant and some bread  The parking is  dollars a night  The internet did work well though  It is located in a pretty good spot as well  Right off of St  Catherine and a couple blocks from Cresent St  The dollar cinema on aires street was a great deal to catch a movie  If you are on a budget get some   slices of pizza on Cresent St or Mont Royal St  The Madhatter on Cresent St  was a chill bar for young people  If you dont want to pay the  for parking you should park at the Casino for free and take the bus back  The buses and trains are   each  Dont turn right on red lights  At the casino if you want to play blackjack or roulette the minimum is   Try the dollar wheel which is a lot of fun and a good way to make some money  The cigarettes and beer were very overpriced in Montreal  Bring your own  Hope we helped  
P => ent hotel   especially for the price We booked this hotel using credit card points but I had seen that it is an inexpensive hotel  For the price it was great Great location right off St  Catherine near lots of shopping bars and restaurants  The room was small but clean  The bathroom was very clean as well  Definitely no bed bugs  
P => Reasonable price for a reasonable room Stayed here in e  for the convenient location and price  We booked the double deluxe room and it looked exactly like the pictures on the website   although the bathroom was initially smaller than expected  Of course I wasnt expecting anything luxurious but my bathroom only had the tiniest corner shower that Ive ever seen no tub at lease there was a window to help me feel less trapped  The room was cozy and the beds were comfortable although mine was somewhat slanted  I personally didnt experience the bedbug thing that the other reviews talked about  Our view consisted of nothing special     We were beside an apartment building and we could see their balconies   so we kept our curtains closed  There was air conditioning included in our room which was a lifesaver because of the heat and a continental breakfast  Orange juice apple juice coffee croissants chocolate croissants muffins and yogurt  They gave you a tray and you had to take it to your room to eat   which  bother some people  The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is that I didnt like the paper thin walls and all the stairs I had to go up with my huge suitcase although the man at the desk was kind enough to offer his help  The verdictThe people at the front desk were friendly and accommodating the rooms were clean and comfortable the location was perfect for me Near Dawson College and Place Alexis Nihon and I only had to pay  This hotel is perfect for very short stays when traveling alone or with friends  
P => Not very impressive Although the location is good we were not very impressed with the rooms The lack of closet space and the fact that the meagre breakfast needs to be taken up into the rooms is quite clumsy If you do not hang up the sign quotplease make up roomquot the room remains unkept Due to airline problems we were delayed and called but were still charged for the rooms although we strongly believe that the rooms were rented out for the night Staff is not familiar with the tourist attractions in the area  
P => AVOID at all costs  I slept in my bed only  hours only to wake up with over a dozen burning itchy red welts all over my body   both our beds were infested with bedbugs  Even with all the lights on they were crawling over the pillows duvets dust ruffle etc     Although this is more modestly priced hotel in the McGill U area no hotel should have bedbug infestation of this magnitude  This is on top of moldy shower curtains stained carpets chair upholstery and facing a pigeon infested and droppings crudded balcony next door to boot  Unacceptable at any cost  
P => A Quaint Place This hotel is a great deal  A lot of people say this hotel wasnt good or such but honestly for Montreal the price is right  I booked a room from travelcuts com and paid night for two double beds their premier room  The room was quite small and the amenities were few but I stayed in downtown Montreal for cheap in a rather modern and definitely clean hotel  I had to climb three flights of stairs to get to my room but it was quiet and every morning there were fresh croissants and juicecoffee for free  Also I found a parking spot up the road for FREE  This is something that youll never find in most downtown Canadian hotels  especially Montreal We were only a few minutes walk from the Metro so we easily hopped on there to get to Vieux Montreal and Le Plateau area This hotel is a definite must for those of you who want to explore the quotrealquot area of the city and also the tourist areas and stay in a nice hotel at half the cost  
P => Recommended We stayed here for  nights in y   Rooms are extremely small but very clean new looking and modern o  Bathroom is very clean and also new looking  Free breakfast of croissants muffins orange juice provided so you can take your food up to your room and eat no room to eat in the shoe box lobby area  Front desk staff seem to only speak either French or Chinese which proved a little difficult when I asked about internet cafes  But no big problem I walked a couple of minutes and found an internet caf  down the road a little  Turn left out the door then first right there is a good noodle house  Also there is a superket and a pizza place immediately across the road from the hotel  We did the Grayline open top double ker bus tour around the city which was very nice  The hotel itself is in a good location nice rooms but very small  If you are travelling light then you will find this a good place to stay  
P => ok for its price Stayed at this hotel during my  week visit to Montreal and have to say its ok for its price  You can not expect much from a budget hotel The room was nice and clean the thermostat worked perfectly and the TV had around  channels which is definatly a plus  The only two thing I did not like was no heat in the bathroom which made it very unconfortable when getting in and out of the shower and also it was not soundproof I had a room next to a bunch of people who was VERY VERY LOUD  I would recommend this hotel to budget travellers and travellers who could sleep thorugh noises  
P => Clean Affordable Cozy Friendly This hotel is what it is  It is not the queen elizebeth or the hyatt but a small  floor    room hotel with small rooms a bit larger than a cruise ship room with no elevator  However we had a great stay there  The staff was very courteous and the property was immaculate  Free Continental breakfast of huge crossants toast muffins and pastries coffee and juice really saved a few bucks on breakfast each day  I paid about  us per night on travelocity website  It is conviently located two blocks from the GUY CONCORDIA metro stop that got me everywhere I wanted to go underground malls biosphereolympic stadium bell centre place des arts etc  It was not very far from the bars and nightlife of Montreal a  to  block walk or short taxi ride away  Security coded door entry to the hotel lobby was a plus  They have limited parking in the underground garage next door   per night only  spaces so I would call ahead to reserve one  The room itself like I said was very clean stocked with a coffee maker and coffee iron a cache of magazines and travel brochures plus Cable TV with some  stations in french and english  The bed was small for  full size mattress but very comfortable  I would stay there again if on a budget or be even if i werent  
P => Great say affortable opition in good location Its strange reading reviews so different from your own experiences  I do agree with the recent post though  clean room good service great cleaning in fact great bathroom and an affordableclean option near the Metro in a great city I had to leave for the airport at  am and the staff called me a cab the afternoon before and provided directions for where to leave my room key since there would be no one at the front desk  I had a quick breakfast each monring and found the service very friendly even though I dont speak French at all  Its situated in more of an English speaking neighborhood so I think theyre quite used to English speaking guests  
P => Great budget hotel Stayed here with my girlfriend in t    Found rooms to be clean and nicely orated brighttrendy as opposed to some of the drab budget rooms you can get  Found the hotel staff very friendly and free breakfast was available of coffee and donuts  Walls in the rooms are thin but we only had a problem on our last night stayed  nights with a loud couple in room above chatting all night We did have a few problems   On arrival we we given the basement room  Aircon was broke and as it was directly under the reception the noise was terrible with people trodding about above you sounding like elephants Next day we asked to move and were given a new room on the second floor  Much nicer and air con was working and this one had a private bath as well  Sadly on the following day the bath wouldnt drain and some gunk came up form the pipes  Nasty smell to say the least  Hotel staff were informed and a plumber was called and all was sorted that day Aside from these issues we still had a great time for    CAD a night it was really good  Felt safe and it was in such a great location  Few minutes walk from Guy Concordia subway station and just off Rue St Catherine  Would definately stay here again 
P => Fair for the Price Amont the quotcheapiesquot in Montreal its ok  The rooms are small my bed was great the bathroom small but the shower was great  If you just need a room its hard to beat  Well located  Doesnt have internet but there is a great internet place m south of it  No elevator  Parking is underground at the apt building next door its secure versus many of the outdoor lots of similar class hotels  Ive done the St Andre and the Berri and would take this any day over them  
P => Location location location We stayed at the St  Malo from e     The best part about the hotel its location  A couple of blocks from the Guy Concordia Metro Station and right off Rue St  Catherine  Very safe area supekets and pharmacies nearby also pretty ent Vietnamese food at the Restaurant Bamboo down the street  The downside to the hotel is that it is really really small   like  rooms small and no elevator and paper thin walls  The desk staff was pretty friendly though and again for the price and location you cant beat it  I would stay again if I was going back to Montreal with friends again not a romantic location though  
P => Nice hotel Really great experience great staff friendly and very helpful  They go out of their way to help you  Great location in the middle of downtown close to all major attraction and the metro  Rooms are clean and recently reated  Would definitely use it again next time Im in Montreal  
P => good reations I stayed at the hotel last week for a couple of days and it turned out to be a wonderful experience  The rooms and bathrooms have all been reated and all the furnishings were brand new  The room was small but cozy and modern and the bathroom was spotlessly clean  A big thumb up to the new management  The hotel really is at the heart of Montreal and we walked everywhere to restaurants cinemas and stores    At that price there are no reasons not to spend more weekends in Montreal     
P => excellent deal My stay in this hotel was very enjoyable  I found some of the previous reviews unfair  It might be because those who wrote the reviews had stayed there before it was reated but let me tell you its one heck of a deal  You get  star rooms and service for less than a  star rate  The people are very nice and did help me when I asked for directions restaurants and places to have fun  Its right in the middle of everything cool in montreal  Ill be definitely staying there whenever Im in montreal and recommend it to everybody   
P => loved it I had no complaints about this hotel  It is located in the heart of downtown and its only two blocks from a metro station and more importantly is next to Crescent street where all the clubs are  It was newly reated and everything is new  And it was also very clean  Price was just unheard off before for a hotel in downtown Montreal  
P => under reations Ah  le hotel st malo  they were under major reations when i stayed there the only two rooms that were intact were in the basement  the entire hotel was under construction with workers banging and crashing at am  the room was imaculately cleaned but the door looked like it had been kicked in a few times the lock was good though  apart from the utter chaos between the front door and the room and the bangingcrashing workers  all was good  except for the lack of a bathtub plug  the owner was friendly gave discount for paying quotcashquot and seemed to be in the quotgrey areaquot of reputability  as long as you are used to this it shouldnt be a problem  its right in the middle of the english area of town near concordia  this makes it a little boring as everyone you meet near the hotel is from toronto  if you want the real cultural experience get a place on the other side of rue st  laurent  
P => Its a room just like it says on the box My boyfriend and I picked the St Malo for a romantic but cheap weekend trip to Montreal  It was really a good experience especially for the price  The rooms are neat and clean with a vaguely nautical or that was really interesting  The showers are hot the towels are skimpy but theyre willing to give you more  It was a wonderful place to spend a hibernation weekend   the rooms were small and very cozy  If you have back problems I wouldnt recommend it   the beds are hard Theres an open ket right around the corner to get all kinds of nice things to eat and its right in the center of the action   right next to Rue St Catherine Theres also a Thai restaurant a good one but I dont remember the name right around the corner and a Metro stop not too far away  One caveat though make a reservation or get there early  We got in around  pm and got the last room in the place only because it was reserved  Overall this was a great place for people who just want a room in admidst the touring but if youre used to travelling in style this hotel will probably be a little lowbrow for you  It did have an incredibly s speakyeasy quality though due to the locked front door and completely outre ble and iron or of the stairs and small lobby  We didnt try the Continental breakfast but Im sure it was nice  
P => Sporchissimo  
P => Exc crable

P => Wonderful space and great location This was our first visit to Montreal and we chose Le Saint Sulpice based on the glowing tripadvisor reviews  We were not disappointed Our room was actually a small apartment  arate bedroom living room welectric fireplace kitchenette balcony overlooking the outdoor dining area and gardens and a large extremely well appointed bath  Grohe fixtures a beautiful molded glass vanity large tub and an enormous shower  There was plenty of closet and drawer space the furnishings were very nice and the queen bed was comfortable with high quality linens  As a coffee addict I especially appreciated a large  cup coffee maker supplied with a more than acceptable blend  no tiny pot dribbling out foul brown water like most hotels  The location of the hotel is superb  right next to Notre Dame an easy walk to the Metro and in the heart of Old Montreal  My only quibbles some of the walls were scarred in places and in need of repair and paint and the carpet was stained and frayed in spots  As a previous reviewer noted pets are allowed in some of the rooms and I suspect the carpet issues can be attributed to that  All in all  a very pleasant experience in a wonderfully unique city  
P => We had excellent service concierge help and a wonderful suite  We recently spent two nights at the Saint Sulpice  The hotel is located in Old Montreal so we could walk everywhere  We had a three room suite BR LRKitchenette and Bath that was like having our own apartment  There is a real neighborhood feel to the area and we were right around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica  There are many restaurants in the area plus we found a grocery store and a pharmacy within a  minute walk of the hotel  The staff was courteous and helpful and the service excellent  We plan to return to Montreal and will stay in the Saint Sulpice  
P => Elegant yet comfortable boutique hotel Our family stayed for four nights in a one bedroom suite at the H tel St Sulpice while I was attending a conference at the Palais des Congr s  We were very pleased with the hotel  The front staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient  The lobby had a European charm and the our room was very comfortable and modern looking  Although it was quite cozy for us with a rambunctious toddler and a baby  The hotel was very quiet which was appreciated The complimentary Internet service and nightly bottled water service were nice touches  The included continental breakfast was also good  The restaurant had excellent food at dinner including a childrens menu although the service was average  The location cant be beat   adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica and very close to lots of lovely restaurants throughout Old Montreal  
P => beautiful hotel with excellent staff in charming historic area The suite was hugh bathroom upscale resturant and garden lovely  Although we had read mixed review on the breakfast  we enjoyed it and had good service both days  The front desk was really helpful and pleasant  The location is in the charming historic district   within walking distance of excellent resturants waterfront and a block from the Notre  Dame Basilica we toured it during the day and were glad we went back for the light show that night before we went out to dinner  Not inexpensive but excellent value  We were there for a couple of days before leaving on a cruise and found it a wonderful place to start our vacation  
P => This Is A Great Hotel Perfect Location  The Hotel is very nice the staff always friendly very knowledgeable and helpful  We loved Montreals old town and this hotel is situated perfectly right next to the Notre Dame Basilica  Our room faced the street  We were on the third floor and enjoyed opening the windows to hear the music of church bells chiming from the Basilica  While the windows were closed the room was very quiet no street noise whatsoever could be heard  The guest floors of the hotel were very quiet  Not once during our four night stay could we hear noise from other guests  Ours was a superior loft style suite and the murphy bed slept comfortably  Having breakfast included in the rate is an added bonus and it contained a ent selection  Bathrooms were much nicer than the average hotel with oversized shower and arate tub  The LOccitane toiletries were the perfect touch and replenished daily  The room itself was nicely appointed  All in all you cant go wrong with Le Saint Sulpice if youre looking for a nice four star hotel in the old town that gives you a unique Montreal touch I wouldve given Le Saint Sulpice a five star rating but was put off we were placed in what appeared to be a pet inclusive suite  No mention of this was made at check in but there was a quotpet in suitequot sign hanging from the door along with the do not disturb sign  It was noticeable pets had stayed here because the carpets and floors were more soiled than they shouldve been  We had friends staying in the hotel while we were there and their room did not have this sign  It was obvious theirs was not a pet suite just by comparing the carpet in the two suites  Their suite was immaculate  Ours maintained an acceptable level of cleanliness but I was dissapointed and nearly requested a different room  That was quickly forgotten because everything else about this hotel was perfect  Le Saint Sulpice gets a solid four stars from me  Would stay here again  
P => Great Choice Vacation with  sisters and Mom for Mothers Day  The only place I could find where the suite could accomodate  of us nicely  Clean bright and comfortable plus and it is right in the Old City which was good for my mother  There outdoor dining area was great for lunch Good staff too  
P => Excellent Hotel We spent  nights over Columbus Day at this hotel  It was excellent  The location cant be beat  the hotel is right next to Notre Dame Basilica  We had a suite with a private bedroom and a living room  The room was well orated and the hotel was well maintained  We were very happy about Le Saint Sulpice Montreal is well worth visiting  The drive from the New York City metropolitan area took about   hours  The leaves were changing as we drove through the Adirondacks  It is easy and safe to walk in Montreal and we had no problems driving and parking  The restaurants are excellent  We took the official tour of Vieux Montreal visited Pointe   Calli re the Museum of Archeology Jardins Botanique and Mont Royal Park  In sum Saint Sulpice is an excellent hotel in an excellent city  
P => Great Anniversary get away    Being a hotelier myself I was impressed with the hotel and its staff  Very nice room with great views  Staff was friendly and very helpful  A beautiful hotel in old Montreal  
P => The best place to be We spent  days at Le Saint Sulpice in Old Montreal and were thrilled with our visit  The location is fantastic right in the middle of everything in Old Montreal right behind Notre Dame and a short stroll to many restaurants and the park along the waterfront  Only two blocks to the metro which can take you just about anywhere in the City We were upgraded to a suite which was bright clean comfortable and roomy with a sofa easy chair desk  There is a kitchenette area with stove microwave refrig and stocked with dishes pans and glassware  The view out the windows which can be opened   a plus looks like my memory of France with cobblestone streets and old buildings The staff is professional friendly and efficient  I would return in a heartbeat and am recommending this to you  It made our trip to Montreal so much better 
P => Great option for Vieux Fort I stayed here two nights with eight other friends in honor of a friends bachelorette quotweekendquot  We were in three rooms which comfortably slept three people per suite with everyone having their own bed  Turn down service was excellent in converting the murphy beds and pull out couches into sleep ready beds each night  The location is perfect for sites in the old town although construction in the area meant traffic could be a real pain  The front desk was quite helpful with directions and suggestions for food and drink  The compimentary breakfast was good but Ill admit Ive had better  It mostly concentrated on continental selections although hot food was available  I have already recommended this hotel to other friends visiting Montreal  
P => Excellent Hotel We arrived early and stored our luggage with the desk clerk  When we returned later that afternoon the room was not ready so they upgraded us to a suite at no extra charge  The room was large clean and quiet The staff was extremely friendly and professional  The evening turndown service provided the next days weather report along with some complimentary bottled water for the hot days ahead The only weird thing was the overwhelming smell of stale perfume in the lobby  It was very distracting  aside from that I would stay there again 
P => The quality and personal touches make it worth while The Saint Sulpice Hotel was an excellent choice for us in Montreal  We stayed for a week with a  year old child The location was excellent right in the old town and close to the Congress Centre and Metro station  The lobby was sophisticated and pleasant  The staff were friendly and helpful  The breakfast was fresh and tasty and the waiting staff very obliging and friendly  Our dhter was made welcome  We found the suite comfortable and bright  The beds were excellent in terms of support pillows and linen with plenty of storage space and cooking facilities The hotel delivers those personal touches and little details that take it beyond the usual slick sophisticated but ultimately a bit bland international chains  
P => Youll love Hotel le St  Sulpice My husband and dhter were very pleased with the hotel le St  Sulpice  We chose is because it offered a suite with an enclosed bedroom so we had some privacy  We were delighted with the or balcony excellent service free breakfast and terrific location  It is very close to the cathedral and an easy walk to Vieux Montreal shops and restaurants  I would go back to Montreal just to stay there again   everything was perfectI think it would be as good a choice for business travelers as it is for our family  There were also many couples of various ages who seemed relaxed and happy  Isnt that how it should be 
P => Cant wait to return to St  Sulpice hotel in Montreal My husband and dhter age  spent two nights at the Hotel St  Sulpice in Montreal  The hotel is located in Old Montreal and very close to the Cathedral  We chose the hotel because it offered a suite with an enclosed bedroom so we could have privacy  We were delighted with the tastefully orated room comfortable bed amp comfortable enough pullout sofa with the quaint balcony and extremely professional service at the front desk  We also received free breakfast for  each morning and that was delicious too  I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat  Another plus the hotel lobby had a subtle but nice fragrance   verbena I think  Really nice  This hotel would be equally good for business travelers families with older children and friends on a weekend shoppingcultural trip  You can walk to the shops and restaurants of Old Montreal  Did I miss anything Go thereThe cathedral quotlight show was kinda okay very hokey but still informative  Dont get me started on the bus tour    skip that  
P => Lovely hotel in a terrific location I recently traveled to Montreal for the first time with my  year old mother and my  year old son and we were all very very pleased with our stay at Le St  Sulpice  Our room deluxe queen suite was very large and lovely and extremely quiet and a real bargain at around night nice Continental breakfast included  Im not generally a fan of contemporary styling but this is a truly beautiful hotel   the or is warm and welcoming its impeccably maintained and the contemporary notes blend seamlessly with the ancient elements  The hotel is right in the heart of Old Montreal between the Science Museum and Notre Dame and there are restaurants and attractions galore within blocks  Having a small refrigerator with real creamer and a cabinet stocked with plates was a very nice touch as was the morning paper and the nightly note with the weather forecast with temps in both Centigrade and Fahrenheit  Im sure we would have loved the fireplace had it not been very hot during our stay As it was our view over the garden below was very nice The hotel staff was great   everyone was very polite and welcoming and we werent made to feel uncomfortable at all that we only spoke English  The nearest metro station is only a few blocks away but is both up and down a reasonably steep hill with cobblestone streets   it might be a little rugged for the mobility challenged The one awkward thing about the room was the use of frosted glass in the bedroom both between the bedroom and the bathroom and between the bedroom and the living room   it was impossible to turn on a light in the bathroom or open the shades in the living room without waking whoever was in the bedroom  This was only a minor issue for us though and wouldnt keep us from returning to Le Saint in the future  
P => Great Location room breakfast   Id stay again Le Saint Sulpice is located in Old Montreal   a great location for walking to Chinatown several museums and the Quays of the Old Ports of Montreal  The hotel is small and our room was perfect for our stay  We had a refrigerator sink dishes and stove top  The hotels stay includes a breakfast in the hotels dining room  It includes breads muffins cereal tons of fruit great coffee juice and ambiance  If you want eggs you will pay an additional   We stayed one week and on the last night a maid walked in our room with a huge bottle of water  We were leaving the next morning via plane so we left the bottle  Im not sure why we didnt get that water during our stay  One oddity was that we asked the front desk to call a taxi for us to leave at  AM for the airport  When we got downstairs there was no taxi so my husband walked to the end of the block and flagged one down  The main valet kept apologizing  Odd   
P => Uneven at best Company corporate rate caused me to stay there many times over the past  years  Have found it uneven in service and cleanliness  Often there is no one at the desk at night or theyre understaffed  Room and laundry service are hit or miss  Even tried to make up for past troubles lost my laundry for a day by giving me a special edible treat which turned out to be spoiledRooms are soulless and have found the previous guests garbage or crusty washcloth still in the room upon arrival on more than one occasion  There are many better places in Montreal  
P => Great Hotel central location Outstanding hotel with large inviting rooms  The sofa bed in our room comfortably slept two quottweenquot children  Great location in Old Montreal  Our room was adjacent to Rue St Paul so it was a bit noisy on a FridaySaturday night  If you need a quite room ask for a room on the courtyard  
P => Treated like Royalty The best part of this hotel is the staff  We were greeted by the ubiquitous doorman and all staff every time we entered the hotel  We felt as if we were the most important guests in the hotel and the staff were constantly concerned about our needs  The breakfast was a lavish buffet and again the wait staff was outstanding This is a beautiful hotel in the old part of Montreal and close to good restaurants art galleries and shopping  The room was luxurious beautifully appointed comfortable and spotless  It is just around the corner from a major theater and the cathedral and the river  It is short cab ride to the cultural center where they have the symphony ballet and etc  The metro station is about a  minute walk  
P => very comfortable it was a very nice experience  Beautiful place comfortable rooms excelent location  
P => Luxury At An Excellent Price This hotel is beautiful luxurious and in an excellent location Staff was amazingly helpful and friendly  The location was perfect    directly behind Notre Dame and walking distance from nearly anything The room was spacious we loved the bathroom and fireplace  The hotel only has queen beds which were cozy  Only negative was the continental breakfast  which was just so so and the upgrade to hot for  was ridiculous  
P => Great Spot in Old Montreal Just got back from a  day stay at Le Saint Sulpice and couldnt be happier with the hotel  The staff was very accommodating and friendly and it was wonderful to come back what is basically an apartment instead of a bedroom with a chair or two  The hotel is perfectly located in old Montreal down the block from Notre Dame and within a short walk of the downtown area  Breakfast was ample it included fruit cereal yogurt cheeses croissants sweet rolls toast nuts juices and coffee or tea if you wanted an American breakfast including eggs bacon and potatoes it was   extra  We certainly enjoyed Montreal there was a lot to do and the people there were exceptionally friendly  
P => Very comfortable hospitable and clean    Lovely Hotel nice staff very mannerly and accomodating    We were on Honeymoon and were given a really nice room    the rooms were exceptionally clean  There were some works going on on the road at the entrance but staff did anything they could to accomodate and help    it wasnt a problem  in fact the new cobbled streetscape is sure to make the place really beautiful when finished    is probably already finished in fact Montreal is a beautul place especially area around the hotel    it was so central we were seconds away from gastronomical heaven and everything was a skip and a hop away     great massage place Zazen just round corner really relaxinganyway to make a long story short    we can recomend   if I was to say there was any downsides mmm was some confusion over being charged twice for breakfast that was already supposed to have been included in room price when got it by room service air conditioning units are qute noisy on upper floor    but tolerable enough   overall I believe we got what we paid for oh and the restauraunt is fantastic albeit pricey    but seriously great steak though   
P => Overall a Great Hotel Le Saint Sulpice offered an enjoyable stay for our trip to Montr al  The hotel was a bit hard to find and parking was difficult because they were repairing the street in front of the hotel  Otherwise the staff that checked us in was extremely helpful and spoke very good English  Our room was quite spacious for a city hotel and consisted of a queen bed and arate living room which contained a pull out sofa  It also had a small kitchenette with a stove microwave and coffee maker  In general the room was very clean  The hotel was in close proximity to several good attractions such as the Notre Dame Basilica and the Old Port  Overall the room was a great value for what we paid  The rooms cleanliness and service were definitely the best features of this hotel  
P => Very nice suite rooms Stayed here during a conference in Montreal  Very central and close to old town and restaurants  Breakfast good   excellent croissants Very big suite free wi fi overall very happy with hotel  
P => Great Hotel I cannot say enough about this hotel  We stay  nights  The room was one of the best I have ever stayed in  It had a arate bedroom including robes  The bathroom had a tub and a arate huge walk in shower  Lots of storage space in hall bedroom and living room  Flat screen TV not too many English language stations but its Montreal nice little balcony and even an electric fireplace  The staff was friendly and helpful to us  Only ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast that was included for the price  The buffet was ok for the price free and if you wanted to have the hot items it was only  dollars more  The only negative I can think of is the city is installing cobblestones on the street outside and it might be a bit noise if your room faced the street  Our room did not and we did not hear anything at night including flushing toilets or anything else The hotel is right behind Norte Dame church is close to lots of shopping and restaurants  Please go to Boris Bistro   order the duck risotto   be the best meal I have every had 
P =>  Star   in a French sort of way Really a very nice competent hotel albeit the   classification should be calibrated on a quotFrench scalequot  Often not mentioned but the location is second to none  The staff were helpful but under no circumstances friendlyengaging   at least for Anglophiles  The room we had a better than average suite was also very adequate spacious and well equipped   although devoid of any real opulence  Breakfast is pretty good although way and by far the most cheap experience is a sign stating that a cooked breakfast is CAD  EUR   extra  this is exacerbated by a whole dialogue with the hostess about your entitlement to a quotcold or hot breakfastquot  Fine for the YMCA but not a   hotel in Old Town Montreal  
P => Amazing Weekend We had the pleasure of travelling to Montreal for the weekend and stayed at Le Saint Sulpice  We had researched different hotels to stay at and chose this one based on the location and reputation it presented  We were amazed at the beauty of the hotel with the gardens and fresh scent as we walked in to the hotel  We were greated with a smile and were treated like royalty throughout the weekend  Our rooms were adjoined as we were seven women travelling together for a girls weekend pleasure trip  The rooms were large beautiful and perfect for our needs  We really cannot say enough about this hotel  I plan to return in the fall with my husband for a romantic weekend  Thank you 
P => velous suprise We were in town for a conference and the conference hotels were all full  What luck that turned out to be Le Saint Sulpice was spectacular in every regard  We walked in late to the best smelling lobby Ive ever been in and were told we had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite  The room was large beautifully appointed and very functional with LOccitane toilettries my favorite and all the amenities you could want  The staff was exceptionally nice and very attentive to our every need  The location cannot be beat  in old town Montreal just two blocks from a great running trail along the old pier Only suggestions for improvement would be wireless internet it is wired which is fine for one but not when two are sharing a room and a slightly nicer breakfast  It was fine but not nearly as fancy and refined as the rest of the hotel  Definitely check out the restaurant for dinner  The trio that plays during dinner was fantastic the staff was wonderful and the food was just out of this world  
P => A great hotel that will exceed your hopes and expectations  Really a wonderful hotel  In four nights we kept waiting to find SOMETHING that would disappoint us but never did  From the first Bon jour as we pulled up out front we were greeted time and again not with a robotic mumble but with a genuinely warm greeting as if from old friends  Lobby was stylish without being weird as was most of Montreal  Comfortable relaxed  And the room   mon dieu Pardon the attempts at french   Montreal will do that to you Absolutely gorgeous suite with entrance including closet and a wonderfully handy little table to drop your keys maps change etc then a well equipped kitchenette with microwave refrigerator stove etc  Incidentally we have stayed at some  star resorts when we can catch a great bargain all over North America and never before have we had a full sized coffee maker with TEN cups of great french roast every morning  Anway from the kitchenette you enter the living room with a pull out couch fireplace and flat screen tv  arate bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable bed with thick down comforter and another flat screen  With doors to bedroom closed was as quiet as our own country home   we slept like babies Bathroom was beautiful with luxurious towels great soaps and lotions very elegant glass sink and extra large two person shower stalldeep bath tub  Location is just behind the extraordinary Notre Dame cathedral in the heart of Old Montreal with tons of stuff immediately nearby and a subway station two blocks away  I swear if I could have justified it I would have made reservations for our next stay when I was checking out this last time 
P => Perfect spot in Old Montreal I just returned from a trip with a family of four   two adults and two teenagers  We had a room with a murphy bed and pull out couch in addition to the arate bedroom  The kids used the murphy bed which was very comfortable   a real mattress on it  Suite was spacious and service excellent  Continental breakfast is great   fresh croissants cheeses fresh fruit muesli kids ordered french toast a la carte from the menu  Hotel just next to Rue St  Paul famous street in Old Montreal and a short walk to the waterfront  We will definitely return to Montreal and stay here again  
P => What a great value   a fantastic hotel with superior service  Based on the rate I was quoted I was so pleasantly surprised by the Saint Sulpice upon arrival  The Old Montreal location was excellent tucked behind Basilica Notre Dame and just a  minute walk to the Metro  The hotel itself is lovely from the large welcoming lobby to the comfortable barrestaurant  Our room was actually more like a one bedroom apartment well appointed and most important very clean  The only odd thing was the frosted window between the bathroom and bedroom to allow light in Im sure but I would have preferred more privacy  When the light was on it lit the bedroom like a beacon  Fabulous LOccitane bath products a soaking tub with arate shower handy kitchenette area and a quiet room that I had requested overlooking a courtyard  And with a lovely continental breakfast included this hotel was an outstanding value  Plus I can not say enough about the staff friendly helpful and welcoming  We will definitely return  
P => Beautiful Luxurious    What a wonderful property This hotel is located in Old Montreal bunches of unique restaurants and old stone streets  The hotel is right behind the Basilica of Notre Dame as well which is also very deserving of attention  St  Sulpice staff were extremely helpful recommended great places to eat  The rooms featured a arate bedroom from the living area  The breakfast buffet was ent but no hot food is included in your stay  Internet is included and a free business center lets you print as needed  Overall the rooms were just beautiful and the staff allow for a relaxing stay by taking care of everything they can    including a card placed on your bed to tell you the next days weather 
P => Stop looking   Stay here You cant go wrong by choosing this lovely hotel  Great old town location  Friendly helpfull staff  Excellent rooms  What more can I say 
P => A real find This hotel is amazing  Its right in old Montreal so you can hear the clip clop of horses down the street  The staff is terrific very friendly and efficient  The concierge was very helpful and set up a wonderful New years eve dinner for us  The best thing about the Saint Suplice are the rooms  Real fireplaces small kitchenettes and duvet comforters make it feel like your own little apartment  You cant go wrong here  
P => Great place Overall we couldnt have asked for more from Le Saint Sulpice  The room was spacious clean and had all the modern amenities   stove sink arate living room and bedroom each with a television large tiled shower and ate bath  We had two dogs with us and the staff provided great service  We were welcomed curbside by the friendliest of gents who was super with the pets and provided us with all the information that we needed  Having dogs is always tricky when traveling but again the staff was exceptionally accomodating  When we inquired about the best local restaurants the staff was honest and not pushing their own place and guided us well  Right in the heart of old Montreal    close to the water and walking distance to everything  Courtyard side was worth the small extra charge  The dog friendly room was out of the way of the rest of the patrons which allowed us to take them in and out without bothering others but quality of the room wasnt compromised because of the dogs presence  Loved the staff loved the location loved the room  Great place 
P => Lackluster Service The staff servicing the rooms provided a friendlier service than those at the front desk The Front Desk and Concierge Staff service were lackluster at best  There was no attempt at any friendly welcome nor an extension of any service The concierges recommendation for a restaurant that served vegetarian food was to quotwalk down the street and look at the menus at each restaurantThe fridge in the room reeked of spilled beer and the freezer section was in dire need of defrostingThe buffet breakfast was a rip off   cold food croissants with very cold centers and very sad looking scrambled eggs and sausage  Have breakfast at any of the nearby cafes and save yourself the frustrationThe location was good although on a busy street so be prepared for noisy street traffic and pedestrians until around  am  
P => Great locationGreat Hotel Weve stayed in a few hotels in Old Montreal and there are several good ones to choose from   the Saint Sulpice is consistently a winner  The rooms are spacious and very nicely orated  The staff are available helpful and friendly  Theyll even help you order take out at am  The location is perfect for touring Old Montreal and for accessing the rest of the city  The hotel allows pets but as a guest you would not know this  We do plan to use this service during a future stay  The only drawback could be the set up in the room  Not sure about other rooms but for both of our visits this year the tv is not easily visable from the bed  It is at the other end of the room across from the couch   on an angle from the bed  And there are no bedside tables  There are cabinets at the sides of the built in bed but these have doors and are not easily accessible  Other than that its perfect  
P => Couldnt ask for more We stayed here for our second anniversary for three nights  It was the most incredible weekend weve ever had  The hotel is beautiful right in the heart of Old Montreal  We were within walking distance from most everything we wanted to do  The room was chic minimalist and clean  The bathroom had a big soaking tub along with a shower stall and being able to take a nice long bubble bath was a luxury I didnt expect  We also had a gas fireplace in the room although we didnt use it much  The staff was friendly and helpful  The hotel is located in the shadows of Notre Dame and across the street is a cute little cupcake shop I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic getaway  
P => Stay at Le Saint Sulpice My husband amp I ided to take a mini honeymoon to Montreal  Neither of us have ever been to Montreal before  We were both very pleased with our experience at Le Saint Sulpice  It is a block away from one of the main streets in Old Montreal Rue Saint Paul and is located on the same block as Notre Dame Basilica  There are also a ton of restaurants cafes shops and galleries within walking distance The hotel was very clean and had a modern contemporary feel  Our suite had a cozy apartment feel but was spacious  The bathrooms had both a shower stall amp very large tub  The staff was very hospitable especially the concierge  Everyone was extremely friendly helpful and fluent in both French amp English We didnt eat at the restaurant within the hotel with exception of breakfast which was included in our package  It was a hot breakfast but didnt vary from day to day no big deal The only complaint which is trivial was scheduling spa services  One of the main reasons why I booked this hotel was the spa located within the hotel  However the massage therapists had to be contacted by the front desk personnel in order to make the appointment and it took at least  requests to the front desk before they were able to confirm an appointment for me  It was a minor hassle but I definitely had to be persistent There is one other thing that I wanted to note  It did not necessarily bother me but I found it unusual   on  of the  days of our stay a staff member entered our hotel room unannounced mid day to drop off bottles of water  I appreciated the bottles of water but the woman entered the room wo knocking both days  On one of the days my husband and I were napping so I was a little startled when I heard another voice in the room suddenly  So if you plan on considering Le Saint Sulpice and I strongly recommend it just be forewarned Just another recommendation regardless of where you ide to stay definitely make it a point to eat at the Bonaparte restaurant  It is only a block away from the hotel and it is well worth it Very romantic and fantastic food 
P => Great place to stay in Montreal We were very happy with the Saint Sulpice  We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was VERY large  We were on the th floor overlooking the street and it was a lovely view  Room was clean and comfortable  Above average  The lobby and courtyard area were absolutely lovely Also liked the gym  The location is excellent for sight seeing as well We found everyone at Saint Sulpice to be extremely nice We arrived early but our room was ready  The staff were consistently friendly and helpful during our stay  After we left we were charged for an umbrella that we did not take  But I contacted the hotel and they were responsive and removed the charge without a fuss  Overall we found the service was excellent and everyone who worked there was very pleasant to deal with  The continental breakfast was fine but nothing amazing  It was included in rate We would certainly stay here again  A great hotel  
P => Try another hotel in Montreal We were here for  nights in ust   This was our rd wedding anniversary and first trip to Montreal  We loved the city and the warm friendly people  Staying in the older part of town feels like Europe not North America and the people seem more like the French in Normandy or Britany where they like Americans than like Canadians The hotel is ok all suites and the staff are great  The concierge was especially outstanding Etienne and the others were very accommodating helpful and friendly  No eyerolls or other obnoxious behavior Our room had obviously had someone smoking in it before we moved in and they were never able to remove the odor  The carpet was not very clean no slippers furnished by the hotel and the very nice bathrobes were very rough feeling and so were the towels  The bathroom was small with no arate shower and tub as the advertising had led us to believe  The furnishings in all that space devoted to LR and Kitchen was sparsely furnished and not very comfortable to lounge in at night  The TV was a flat screen but no HD cable so lousy picture  Bed was a Queen No Kings in the hotel and not very comfortable for two tall people  Breakfast was not included in our rate as Expedia had led us to expect quotOh its your anniversary Well ask the hotel to include breakfast they usually doquot None of that and the hotel swears that they NEVER include breakfast in Expedia bookings  Breakfast was more than  for two  Our guidebook discouraged the use of the hotel restaurant so we never ate there for dinner  Montreal is full of outstanding restaurants though most are New York pricey given the current rate of exchange C  for a US   Their business center is way too small only  PC but what they have is excellent  Just  require considerable wait time to check your email  Great internet speed and a first class printer We would look at other hotels in the same part of town which include breakfast in the rate but if you get a quotdealquot the St  Sulpice is okay  It  not be an option much longer since the owner is selling the individual rooms as quotcondominiumsquot and will operatemange it for the quotnewquot owners  We didnt inquire as to how much theyre getting for roomsuite ownership  
P => Ideal for location quality and price in Old Montreal I traveled to Montreal with my son aged   Le Saint Sulpice was perfect The location was ideal its right up the road from the Science Center and lots of other attractions suitable for a pre teen including the Amphi Bus the Labyrinth and Segway rental at Shed  plus the fantastic Pointe a Calliere Museum of Archeology and History  The room was excellent the bedroom and sitting area were arate and the sofa converted to an extra bed so we each had our own room  The linens were crisp and clean and the beds were extremely comfortable even the sofabed that I slept in  Our th floor room looked out onto the courtyard and we had quiet even when we opened our extra large window  The kitchenette was nothing more than an electric range atop a minibar but the cabinets were stocked with pots pans and cutlery so I could fix the requisite ramen noodle bedtime snack for my ever ravenous boy  The price was great I did the whole package on Travelocity but I figured the room rate at  a night and there were no hidden fees or taxes  Finally the service was excellent none of the staff looked older than  okay be Im getting old but they were attentive helpful and knowledgeable  I selected Le St Sulpice based on the reviews I found on TripAdvisor and in thanks to those reviewers I am adding my own positive feedback on this site  You wont go wrong with this hotel   have fun in Montreal 
P => Charming hotel in great location This hotel was lovely and very accommodating  It is located in Vieux Montreal which is a good tourist destination to stay in  The hotel is surrounded by art galleries tourist shops and restaurants which offer table dhote meals where you can get an appetizer entree drink and dessert for one price  Le Saint Sulpice is also by the water which is a nice area to stroll through  In addition the hotel is located a few blocks from the Metro which can get you downtown  In my opinion the only  places to stay in Montreal when visiting would be either the old town or downtown The suite I stayed in a deluxe suite was nice and luxurious  My only complaint would be the size of the room for the bedroom which was a little small but then again youre just sleeping in that room  Also in the living room area I had to stand up closer to the television for the remote control to work  I stayed on the first floor which was kinda strange since the outdoor dining service was outside my window  A white curtain blocked the inside view of my suite but it was strange to not have the curtain opened most of the time I enjoyed staying at this hotel despite the mediocre free breakfast which charged  for hot food such as bacon and ham which werent even cooked that well  The service is good though especially if youre only fluent in English like myself  The staff was courteous and very helpful  
P => I wonder why they are in the business  We just returned from a wonderful  days in Quebec and our only low point was Le Saint Sulpice in Old Montreal Perhaps we were spoiled by  nights at the Fairmonts Richeleiu and Frontenac where the staff welcomed us to their hotels with pride and joy  Then we arrived at Le Saint Sulpice and felt like every conversation was punctuated with deep sighs on their part and we had a sense that we were bothering them or deemed beneath them somehow  The conversations were like quothello wed like to check inquot   sigh    quotis the  a day parking in and outquot   hhty look   sigh    quotwed like to check outquot   look away   make a face   sigh  Not really confrontational stuff here  A high point was when we called for three pillows they asked what we needed them for  then only delivered two  My husband has arthritis and uses two extra pillows to sleep without pain plus the sofa bed needed a pillow in case you are curiousThe rooms were clean  The bedspreads were pilled and old looking be time for an update  Great location in Old Montreal  
P => Lovely hotel in Montreal This is a lovely hotel in the Old Port a great section of Montreal  An inviting and elegant lobby  Very easy access to Metro you can get absolutely anywhere on the Metro and close to many shops and restaurants  The Saint Sulpice has a very helpful staff who recommend places to eat give great directions and are fairly quick to respond to requests  The only problem we had was our TV remote control didnt work horrors and they never got around to replacing it  Great bathroom with arate shower and wonderful toiletries LOccitaine  One note is that in our room the shower had a frosted glass wall that was visible in the room so if anyone was talking a shower their silhouette was there for all to see  With small children it would be very embarrassing  For a couple traveling together be not so embarrassing 
P => Lovely hotel very good service We were extremely pleased with our stay at this hotel  We were travelling with our young child and the staff was fantastic at accommodating every need  We booked a superior room and it was HUGE and lovely   there was even a mini kitchen with a microwave and  burner stovetop One recommendation that I would make if booking this hotel would be to make sure that you arrange for a room on the second floor or above its a very well travelled street and you would get a lot of noise at street level  We had an excellent experience and would stay there again in a heartbeat 
P => Excellent hotel We just returned from a four night stay at the St  Sulpice and could not have been more pleased  We were able to walk wherever we wanted to go even to the main stage of the jazz festival  min walk and to any of a number of excellent bistros the metro and tourist attractions Our rooms were spacious and immaculate and the beds very comfortable  Our windows faced the lovely garden restaurant in the inner courtyard and we had no problem with noise at all  The air conditioning was in excellent working order Service was impeccable from the moment we checked in  I called and made arrangements for a large suite party of  and we were delighted with our accommodations  We stayed in a one bedroom with a queen bed queen pullout sofa and queen Murphy bed  The rooms were light and airy with a small kitchen areawet bar  The bedroom was a little small but with the living area it didnt really matter A word of advice if you are arriving by car it is more cost effective to self park at any number of locations in the area  We found the lot the hotel uses and while the daily rate through the hotel was night when we parked ourselves we were charged day by the lot We did not have dinner in the restaurant but we did breakfast there everyday as a continental buffet was offered with the room rate for  and we found it to be sufficient but there are numerous cafes in the area which offer more cost effective alternatives if breakfast is not included with your room When I return to Montreal I will definitely return to the Saint Sulpice  
P => Le Saint Sulpice is an excellent choice in Old Montreal Great hotel with very big rooms and an excellent location  If you stay anywhere in Montreal you want to stay in Old Montreal and Le Saint Sulpice is an excellent choice  The staff was friendly the room was very big with a arate bedroom big bathroom and the hotel is in the middle of old Montreal  We would stay again  
P => Great Location  Clean and Large Rooms  No Complaints We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice during the last week of   We did not encounter any problems as the previous reviews have  The rooms were great  Large rooms arate bedroom ent size bathrooms and free high speed internet access in the rooms  We forgot a network cable and quickly were able to get one from the front desk  The hotel staff were helpful  They did not bend over backwards for us but then again we did not expect them to  The location is wonderful  I wouldnt recommend staying at any other location in all of Montreal  The only very small complaint is that upon check in we were given vouchers for breakfast at the S Restaurant  We had one for each day of our stay with our names printed on them  When we used them for breakfast we were told they were not vouchers they were simply business cards advertising the restaurant  So our breakfast ended up costing us  that day  When we asked the front desk they said that since we booked through Expedia we did not get breakfast but we did get a great rate  And from what I am reading we did pay an excellent rate of less than  per night  
P => Perfect location in Old Montreal I stayed at the Le Saint Sulpice for one night on a very busy saturday night during the grand prix races  The room ended up costing well over  including parking lunch and a pet maintenence fee  I am disappointed to see this hotel book for less then  on other weekends but what could i do Location was most important as well as being pet friendly I did not hesitate to recommend this hotel as it was in the best location for tourists who wish to see the old city Check in was nice the room was large and comfortable with a great shower  I loved the La Occitane toiletries they smelled wonderful  Only queen beds and a queen pullout is available No problem bringing my dog except for the   pet charge but i knew that upon booking  valet parking with in and out privileges if you need it Really cool to look out the window at all the people having fun in the streets at night Breakfast buffet was included with yogurts fresh fruit and pastriesAnd free internet was available in the business center really good looking gym too I would like to go back again on a much cheaper weekend  
P => Great location and excellent room We stayed here over the memorial day weekend for about  a night  That price seemed like a bargain and in turns out that in fact the room was excellent and totally gigantic probably about sf  Having said that there are probably other hotels in Montreal that are far less expensive and still very nice  This is important for visitors from large cities around the world e g  New York Tokyo London etc   They might scoff at the idea of a  hotel since in these cities that will not buy you anything nice at all  But in Montreal this will probably get you a really good standard hotel room considering  got us a huge apartment with a kitchen and fireplace The room was clean the staff very friendly and the location amazing  We didnt try the breakfast Overall I recommend but would only stay again if I traveled with a family and needed all that space  
P => Not worth the money For an th birthdaygraduation present I ided to take my sister to Montreal for a long weekend  After hours of research I ided to go with this hotel due to the outstanding reviews that it got  Ive stayed in many hotels all over the world and Ive never been as disapointed with a hotel  The service was HORRIBLE  Right after the valet parked my car I realized that I forgot some things in it  When I approached one of the valets about it he rolled his eyes and sighed  Not called for The next morning I couldnt find the tickets for my breakfast which was included   When I explained it to the girl that was working she was extremely rude and talked down to me about the situation  I also have severe allergies which I communicated to the hotel before I got there and when we checked in  There was one really nice girl at the front desk I wish I could remember what her name was   Long story short   My needs were ignored and I got blamed for the situation  Most of the staff werent very understanding or very friendly  It is in a great location though  
P => Nice but not that nice We just got back from a weekend stay at the St  Sulpice  While we had a nice stay we wonder why this hotel is rated so high in Trip Advisors rankings For the price you pay for one of these suites we did not think it was worth it  We had previously stayed at the Hotel Place dArmes where we had paid less per night and had a much more luxurious stay The St  Sulpice is quiet clean and well situated in Old Montreal near galleries and restaurants  It doesnt have fancy rooms or any wow factor  No flat screen TVs no turndown service no luxury slippers and no abundance of amenities  The breakfast is also appaulingly meager  On our last morning there were only cereals toast and some stale fruit to choose from  The service is smiley but a bit aloof  It takes an effort to flag a waiter for a second cup of coffee The beds are very uncomfortable and we came away with serious back and neck aches  In sum this is more a  star hotel rather than the luxury  star establishment it touts itself to be  We wouldnt stay back here again as there are better hotels in the area to choose from for the same price meaning go to Hotel Place DArmes Hotel Nelligan or W Hotel  
P => Nice Hotel Weve stayed at Le Saint Sulpice several times and have always enjoyed our stay  The hotel is located in the heart of Old Montreal just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral  The lobby of the hotel is warmly orated and includes a cozy sitting area around a large fireplace  Through the lobby is a beautiful courtyard restaurant under white canopy  Weve eaten at the restaurant a few times and have found the food and service somewhat hit and miss  Overall acceptable though The rooms are beautifully orated with dark wood accents and modern or  Some have electric fireplaces and some have small balconies  The rooms tend to be somewhat narrow but still provide a comfortable stay  
P => A very good hotel I stayed for one night and wished I could have stayed for more  I was given a beautiful room facing the street  At first I was worried that it would be noisy but it wasnt and I slept very well  The door and concierge staff are very professional and very helpful  The front desk staff however could use a little warming up  My room rate included a continental breakfast that was served in the lovely SS Restaurant and which was plentiful cerealcroissantstoastfruit  etc and very well waited on by a diligent crew of charming waitpersons  The room rate also included internet and use of the business centre which I needed to print my boarding pass  The hotel is ideally situated in Old Montreal surrounded by restaurants and attractions and means of transport  I would return without hesitation  
P => A Great Hotel and Brilliant Staff  We were knocked out by this hotel where we stayed for five nights in il five femalesThe staff were lovely the rooms top class and the location none of us had a car is ideal for the shops restaurants and sightseeing It was a superb holiday and we have ided to go back once the weather gets a bit warmer  
P => Lovely Hotel in Old Montreal  My husband and I recently stayed at The Saint Sulpice for the first time  It is a lovely hotel situated in Old Montreal  We arrived quite late on a Sunday night in ch and our car was quickly unloaded and we were settled in our suite within minutes  The beautiful entrance and lobby of the hotel was quite large with several different seating areas scattered throughout the area  One of the groupings was extra special with a cozy fireplace  All the rooms at the hotel are basicaly suites  They are a generous size and very comfortable and homey well designed and nicely orated  You can tell a lot of thought went into making their guests as content as possible The entrance to our suite was a good size  It had a place for our boots and shoes and the usual type closet  What made it really stand out was the entrance also had a little table with two chairs which I really liked and thought was such a nice touch  It was different to have a sitting area in the entrance and it was one of the things I liked most about our suite  Once we walked past the entrance we noticed a small counter top stove and a little fridge and all the necessary cooking accessories in an overhead cabinet we would need if we ided to cook in our room  The livingroom was quite pretty it had a sofa and a comfty leather chair a few accent tables and lamps and an electric fireplace across from the sofa  Also in the liviingroom area there was a desk with a chair where you could sit and make phone calls or use your computer  Next to the desk there was a set of patio doors opening onto a balcony  For obvious reasons we didnt even open the doors unless we wanted to have a mountain of snow in our room I am sure in the summer it would be wonderfulThe suites have a arate bedroom with french doors which I felt really added to the character of the space  There were two large television sets not flat screen not that it mattered to us but I know it is important to some travellers that is why I mention it one in the livingroom and one on the bedroom There are a few features that made this hotel stand out  The first that I found so useful was the two closets in the bedroom  It was so handy that we could have our own closet  and it made it so much easier to unpack and everything was then at our fingertips  The bedroom also had a dresser with large drawers that again served a very useful purpose  It was great to have a portable telephone in the bedroom  Actually come to think of it this was the first hotel we ever stayed in that had portable phones The powder room was quite large well lit super clean with a big shower big bathtub lovely sink area and a full length mirror on the back of the door  One of the walls had a few small built in glass shelves where we put our incidentals  There were bathrobes provided a hairdryer and wonderful LOccitane products that were restocked daily  I didnt really like the towels    when I go to a hotel I find white towels look so crisp and clean and the towels here were beige  I realize it  seem petty but it is just a personal preference  Colour aside I have very sensitive skin and I found the towels were a little on the ruff side  I am quite sure they were high quality towels however I did want to mention it as I know it is that kind of information that I find helpful when reading reviews  If we stay here again I would bring a towel from home  And really I should have brought my own to begin with it completely slipped my mind  I do want to make it clear though If you dont have sensitive skin you will be fine with the towels  The only complaint was one morning there was no hot water  I realize this can happen anywhere but since we were not informed about the problem we found out the hard way  A simple note under the door or a message left on the telephone would have been greatly appreciated  And when I called down to ask if there was something wrong with the hot water I found the reception could have been a little nicer  The hot water was off most of the day by the next morning it was working again  The following day we were left a note of apology in our room with  chocolates  If we would have been told about the problem I probably wouldnt even be mentioning it right now  A little customer relations when problems such as that arise I find goes a long way We found the hotel staff for the most part very professional the concierge desk and valets were very helpful and friendly and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job and even left us little notes in our room thanking us for the tip we left her which I thought was so nice Because of the terrific amount of snow while we were in the city we could not take advantage of the great location of the hotel  If the weather would have co operated we could have walked to many places  We did walk to the Basilica and to a few restaurants nearby  I am certain in the warmer months it would be an ideal location  The area surrounding the hotel seemed very quaint and a few times we saw horse drawn carriages going by the hotel All in all we enjoyed our stay at the Saint Sulpice and we would not hesitate to go back  I would like to thank fellow Trip Advisor member JDP for suggesting this hotel and in turn I feel comfortable recommending this hotel to other travellers Thank you for reading my review 
P => Good Choice  I guess When making a hotel choice this website influences about   of my ision  Here is my opinion of this hotel  The location was very good  It is in the heart of Old Montreal  All of the tourist attractions in this area are within walking distance  The metro station Place dArms is also within walking distance and it is very easy to navigate the metro system  The church is next door  Note if you want to see the church you have to pay to enter unless you are attending mass  I found this a bit ridiculous  I have never paid to enter a church anywhere in the world  The hotel is clean and modern  The room we had was very spacious  The bathroom had the biggest shower I have ever seen  It also had a huge sunken bathtub  So I guess the choice to stay here was a good one  But although the concierge was helpful I thought the staff was a bit brisk I do not know how to explain it  We needed the sofa bed turned down bc we traveled with our children  I have stayed in other hotels with sofa beds and when the room is made up in the moring the sofa is put back together and then at night turned down once again  Here it stayed a bed the whole time therefore taking seating and general space away  At night housekeeping comes by with complimentary water but thats it the room is not freshened up again  Also the last day we were there we left the room at  am and returnted after  and the room had not been cleaned  The hotel was not full so I do not know what happened  We left again and returned later and it was made up I recommend this hotel but I was not blown away by it  
P => wonderful stay in Old Montreal The St Sulpice is located right behind the wonderful cathedraland is a beautiful small boutique hotel  The rooms are very comfortable and extremely clean  Loved the fireplace Staff were very helpful and we had a great stay Would definitely recommend as an adult getaway weekend hotel  
P => Wonderful experience at St  Sulpice Suite was perfect for traveling with teenage son so he had his own bedTV  Hotel staff were excellent  Rooms are incredibly quiet and comfortable  Location is in the center of Old Montreal walking distance to everything  Would absolutely stay there again  
P => excellent hotel my boyfriend now husband and i spent a long weekend here over labor day and i can basically sum it up by saying that this is by far the NICEST hotel weve stayed at thus far in our travels together  we were here during a festival or several festivals so it was a lot of fun  there was a very authentic colonial festival complete with costumes ching band and dancing  great times its a fantastic part of town just a half block from the harbor and all of its shopping and dining  DEFINITELY the best part of town as you  know some of montreal gets kind of seedy  the restaurant is wonderful tho expensive and i highly recommend stopping by the garden for a drink  the fountains are lovely and so are the staff  ask the concierge where to go for dinner and they will set up reservations for you even if its already late in the evening  the tub in the rooms is huge accomodates two  the rooms seem to have been recently reated and they are very spacious  the only issue we had and this  no longer apply is that there was some construction across the street  other than that i say this is a great value for a luxury hotel  highly recommend it  
P => Lovely hotel My husband and I ided to take a drive to Montreal from Boston for our nd wedding anniversary and selected Le Saint Sulpice based on a friends recommendation  I initially booked via travelocity com but then found that we could get a nicer room for less money by booking directly through the hotels website so did that instead Le Saint Sulpice is right in the heart of Old Montreal within walking distance to many nice restaurants and shops  Upon our arrival we were greeted by a valet who parked our car and bellmen who offered to take our bags  Everyone was extremely polite friendly and accommodating Once in our room we tried to make a dinner reservation at our favorite Montreal restaurant only to find it no longer existed  I called the concierge who recommended a great restaurant nearby Delmo on Rue Notre Dame and he made a reservation there for us Our room was lovely with living room area kitchenette and arate bedroom  The bathroom was extremely nice with a very large tub  My only complaint is that the mattress was way too hard and we both found it uncomfortable On our second night we had dinner reservations several blocks away  We had planned to walk but it was pouring so we ided to drive  We called the valet for our car and they had it ready within a few minutes  They saw us to our car with a large umbrella and greeted us with the umbrella when we returned from dinner I would absolutely recommend Le Saint Sulpice and would definitely stay there again  Lovely rooms and friendly service  
P => Everything We Expected St  Sulpice is contemporary style in an old world setting  Great service  Room was clean and pleasant  We had a nice view out over the back courtyard and across the rooftops to the St  Lawrence  Great location  In Vieux Montreal right behind Notre Dame which is magnificent and we easily walked up to St  Catherine Street and the Latin Quarter or Chinatown  Weather changed dramatically during our stay and both AC and heating worked great with easy use  Balcony was wonderful  Big shower was great for two Breakfast was simple but the restaurant was nice with friendly professional service and how can you go wrong with fresh fruit and chocolate croissants Highly recomend  Would stay again in a heartbeat  
P => Terrific all around We just returned from  wonderful nights at the Saint Sulpice  We splurged for the mid priced suite and werent dissapointed  We had a large living room and bedroom the bathroom was very large with a great tub and walk in shower  Service was excellent I broke the hairdryer in the middle of drying my hair before we were going out to dinner and in less than  minutes they brought me a new one  Great location    very short walk to the Metro Only thing that needs improvement is the quotgymquot  Outdated treadmills and very dark gym room  Other than that I highly highly recommend  
P => Loved it The hotel was fabulous  The location is perfect   right next door to Notre Dame a few blocks away from a subway station food attractions et cetera  The rooms were very nice an excellent value for the money  Each room has a kitchenette so if you were so inclined you could prepare meals  They even had pots dishes et cetera  The hotel was very quiet  The service was fantastic The only thing I did not like was the S restaurant  I ate breakfast there one morning  Not only was it overpriced the food was cold  I arrived not long after the restaurant had opened so you would have expected everything to at least be warm If you book directly with the hotel they give you a quotfreequot breakfast  I am glad I saved a few bucks and booked through Expedia after experiencing the breakfast Also one last tip   Canadian taxes are no longer refunded  Last fall Canada repealed the law  You should view the CAD price as full price especially since the Canadian dollar is now on par with the U S  dollar If I return to Montreal I will definitely stay at the Saint Sulpice again  
P => Excellent service My wife and I     middle class Americans with modest travel experience    recently stayed here for a long weekend  We were attracted by the outside courtyard and the many excellent reviews  We were not disappointed  We were treated superbly by all staff members the hotel is beautiful and unique and the courtyard is a terrific place to enjoy a bottle of wine a glass of beer a Cuban cigar whatever  The hotel is a great mix of the old and the contemporary and we really loved just laying around the room  Some people suggest Claude Postel for breakfast    be aware that they have moved and I am not certain it is the right choice unless you are looking for pastries  Our friends gushed about Bonapartes for lunch but we went for dinner and found the place staid  So lunch would be the better choice and we do trust their call Perhaps the true highlight of the trip was our dinner at Ferreiras a Portuguese place  Pricey but worth every penny  I started with grilled opus and went for the fruits de mer    wow and I am not even a big fish eater  My wife had a salted blackened cod    again blew us away  The staff was great and the ambiance upscale hip but not pretentious or uncomfortable in any way  We are not hip or upscaleIf you are looking for solid bistro food near the hotel we liked Holders  Also contemporary  Not fabulous but an enjoyable experience and very convenient to the hotels location If you are ever thinking you deserve a splurge this  well be the place  
P => Great location but        We chose this hotel for three major reasons  One we were travelling with a dog and Saint Sulpice accepts dogs two the location in the heart of old Montreal and three it was billed as a luxury four star hotel  The room we were assigned was on the fifth floor and looked out onto the street  It was undoubtedly a quotdogquot room as the carpet was dirty and full of stains  I would definitely recommend asking for a room overlooking the inner courtyard and this side of the hotel is extremely dark and because it overlooks the street it was very noisy at nightime particularly between midnight and  AM when the bars are closing  Because we were there on the weekend when we stepped out on Saturday and again on Sunday there was vomit on the sidewalk a little ways down from the hotel which I only narrowly avoided stepping into  This mess was still there a few hours later when we returned from lunch  The room itself is very large with a arate bedroom and also has a tiny kitchenette  The room had evidence of the previous person with grime on the sink and a dirty table  The outside door was covered with dust  The most difficult part of the room was how gloomy it was we left all of the lights on all of the time and it still felt extremely dark  We ordered room service our first night and had guinea fowl and shrimp  The guiney fowl was tough and tasteless and the shrimp dish was so salty it was inedible  Heavily salted dishes are often a sign of the use of powdered stocks so anyone allergic to MSG should avoid this food as I had a bad reaction to it  We had tremendous difficulty getting our room cleaned  It simply didnt happen the first day there although we were out from    On the second day I called and requested a specific time to have it cleaned which it was  On the third day I called and asked to have it cleaned while we were out and was told that it would not be possible to ask for a specific time for cleaning although their literature suggests that one can do this  Sure enough when we returned after being out for  hours in the afternoon the room still wasnt cleaned with no evidence of the housekeeping cart even being on our floor  We called down again and again had to make arrangements to leave the room for an hour and a half and when we returned at five it had finally been cleaned  We asked for a new hairdryer as the one in our room wasnt working but it was never replaced  We appeared to be the only people on the fifth floor perhaps this is why we were forgotten  Although the hotel web site suggests the hotel has a dedicated concierge when we went down to the front desk to ask the concierge a question it was the same young man who checked us in  While he was very sweet he wasnt very informative  We asked him if there were any outdoor restaurants where our dog would be allowed and he replied that there had been a huge quotcrackdownquot on dogs on patios and there were no restaurants that accepted dogs  This turned out not to be true as when we went around and asked there were several outdoor restaurants that accepted dogs  The breakfast itself was included with the room and was a continental style buffet with a four dollar surcharge for the hot items  We ate there once and it was pretty awful  The bacon was rancid Ive never had rancid bacon so it must have been very old and the bread was dried out brown and white wonder bread  At  there was only one slice of brown bread left and it was not refilled during the time I was there  I guess I was expecting a bit more than economy hotel type food  The coffee was tepid and served with milk instead of cream  The service was surly at best and it took forever to get a bill  There is a very sweet little breakfast place around the corner I would recommend avoiding the restaurant at all costs  I spoke French the entire time I was there thus we were not given indifferent service because we went making the effort to use the language  We asked for a room with a balcony and although the hotel was quite empty we were not accomodated no doubt due to the fact we were travelling with a dog and there are only a few doggie rooms  There appears to be a shortage of staff perhaps because we were travelling in the off season  If you are travelling with a dog there is wonderful green space just steps away from this hotel down by the water  Otherwise I would not recommend this hotel  
P => wonderful hotel in a perfect part of the city We booked the St  Sulpice because we wanted to stay in Old Montreal and knew nothing really of the area or the hotel  It had a good rating on TripAdvisor so we went ahead and booked it WELL WORTH IT  We got lost in Montreal and ended up in a different area of town with the name St  Sulpice Road  I phoned the hotel and the Concierge knew exactly where we were and gave us the directions to get there Valet parking a nice touch where do they put the cars anyways and costs day  Looking at trying to find parking anywhere looks like a nighte so was worth it  They even later brought our water and fruit to our room that wed left in the car Beautiful room  Clean well furnished and included a kitchenette as well   Pots and plates provided  Gorgeous bed linens comfy bed with arate tv in the bedroom  Living room had great furniture and was huge with its own tv  Bathroom was really nice and had lots of towels we didnt have to ask for extras Housekeeping was great every day once they noticed we were keeping our bottled water we brought in the bar fridge they provided us with their own bottled water every day  Nice touch Breakfast was free with our room  Continental available lots of nice choices not just donuts and upgrade to include eggs and sausage for additional  if wanted  The breakfast staff seemed to be disorganized however and the service was lacking including an arguement from a waitress who wanted to bill us for the extra breakfast we didnt have  Tables were set elegantly and the food was good  Nice atmosphere in the dining room although we only had breakfast there Front desk staff helpful with tourist y ideas and directions  Old Montreal is so great we just parked the car and let it sit while we were there we walked everywhere or took the Metro which was cheap and easy A pricey place to stay but where isnt in Montreal but was full of quality and we thoroughly enjoyed it  Its in the heart of Old Montreal which is well worth the price  
P => Great Advice Simply put      an outstanding hotel and stay in Vieux Montreal  The hotel is in an outstanding location in the old part of town which we considered much superiior to a downtown location  A block from Notre Dame and within comfortable walking distance to most that Montreal has to offer including step from the waterfront and activities on the piers  Besides the location the hotel is special down to the smallest details  Our quotLoft Suitequot came with a Murphy Bed which was no compromise for comfort and the room was very spacious and stylish including rich woods with leather furntiure and a glass sink basin in the bathroom  With European style windows that swung open we were able to enjoy people watching on the main thorougfare Rue Saint Paul  And dont overlook the patio off the lobby for food andor relaxation  We had an outstanding stay with the one exception of the quottourist trapquot restaurant we choose on Place Jacques Cartier  
P =>  Beautiful Montreal  We have just returned from a lovely stay at this Hotel It is centrally located  walking distance to everything Science Center  Imax theater waterfront parksShops restaurants and around the corner The Notre Dame Basilica  The Basilica has a wonderful light  sound and history show at night this is a very nice way to see the church  Our  year old dhter loved itThe hotel has everything to offer outdoor patio seating and another restaurant down stairs This is where they serve breakfast Our room was huge large living room with kitchenette pull out couch  French door opening out to patio plenty of closet space  Great bathroom shower and soaking tubglass sinks robes and plenty of LOccitane products Staff was very friendly and accommodating  We needed to get our car out to go to the Boidome area and it took less than  mins This Hotel has a small gym upstairs and a spa  I didnt have time to use either The other thing that this Hotel has to offer being in old Montrealmost buildings have steps Saint Sulpice is totally handicapped accessible  They offer accessible rooms with showers there is a ramp in the lobbyno steps to get into Hotel and an elevator I would reccommend this Hotel to everyone Because of the great location accessibility and friendly staff and service  
P => Wondeful Montreal I just got back from a  night stay at this hotel  The whole experience was lovely  The location is perfect right in the heart of Old Montreal and within walking distance to shopping good restaurants and the metro The concierge Patrick was wonderful and full of great reccomendations for us  The room was quite large and setup like an apartment which made the stay more comfortable Some of the great restaurants that we got to try when we were there Brunoise Toque try the  course degustation menu and LAvenue Overall my fiance and I love Montreal and had a wondeful time there  
P => Huge room great property loved it I spent  nights here on a trip with my  year old and her father  The rooms at this hotel are set up as condos they can be owned and rented out to hotel guests so they are fairly large  Our room had a queen bedroom with a door to the very large bathroom and glass doors to the living area The tiled foyer was about  by  feet  There is a wide short hallway into the living area which has a pullout couch several leather chairs a TV and kitchenette with a ceramic cooktop  We had a courtyard view with a large openable window  The hotel itself is lovely  The free continental breakfast was just OK but acceptable The staff were very polite and helpful  Valet parking is  a night but you need it in this area of the city Old Montreal where parking is almost impossible  You are right in the center of things here walking distance to many restaurants shops other attractions  
P => Great Hotel Great Location First visit to Montreal in a long time and found this hotel through trip advisor  In the heart of old Montreal and easy walking distance to everything  Staff was very helpful finding restaurants and making travel arrangements  We would stay again 
P => Love this hotel Will go back My husband and I spent  days in Montreal over the Memorial Day Holiday  I chose the St  Suplice because we enjoy boutique rather than large chain hotels  We were definitely happy with the choice First was the perfect location  Being in the Old Port was very convenient to restaurants and attractions  We were just a couple blocks from St  Paul St  and Jacques Cartier place which are the most interesting if you want people watching and outdoor cafes  Near to downtown and the metro too  The hotel was probably the most quiet Ive ever been in  Altho it was full we never heard a footstep toilet flush or water running  We were in a one bedroom suite on the top floor th which included a balcony overlooking the courtyard   and tops of other buildings  We had our coffee out there every morning  It also had a real wood fireplace which we didnt use  The bathroom was large with a huge soaking tub and arate shower  The glass sink was beautiful  We did not eat at the restaurant  Lots of closetsa kitchenette and a living room  Staff friendly and helpful  
P => Beautiful Excellent Service A Must Stay I just arrived home today from a  night honeymoon stay at the Saint Suplice  I loved loved loved this hotel  My husband and I were treated wonderfully  The rooms were beautiful and the garden view amazing  Such wonderful and luxurious accomodations  We requested a recommendation for dinner from the concierge who booked us a delicious restaurant  After we were done eating our waitress delivered us  glasses of port quotcourtesy of our conciergequot  It was very sweet of him and the St Suplice If you are traveling to Montreal there isnt a better place to stay  
P => Great Place for the Girls Weekend Three of us travelled to Montreal to celebrate my sisters Big    We shopped our way through the Montreal neighborhoods stopping occasionally to indulge in fabulous French food  This Hotel did not disappoint  Our Deluxe Suite was comfortable for the three of us  The bathroom is superb with elegant sink walk in shower soaking tub and LOccitane toiletries  Location in Old Montreal was great  We especially appreciated that it was just two blocks from the Metro    which we found wonderfully clean and user friendly  The hotel staff was attentive and helpful with recommendations and reservations  Many of them greeted us by name  We used the health club each day  The massages were great  The only negative was the misunderstanding with the front desk staff about the room rates  We had a discount through the Montreal SweetDeal website as advertised in the New York Times  Though we confirmed the prices at check in the bill was still wrong at check out  It was a hassle to get the clerk to amend the bill  He did so pleasantly but it took  minutes and I overheard other guests checking out complaining about mistakes in their bills also  Despite the hassle of the quotout the doorquot experience we would still highly recommend this hotel and return there happily  
P => A Third time I have stayed here and I love it a little more each time rooms are large and well appointed staff fantastic and the food is to die for cannot understand previous poster who said food was bad I had the swordfish and chocolate pudding my husband had beef and sushi we are still talking about it  weeks later divine 
P => Absolutely Fantastic My husband and I stayed at the Sulpice after Christmas through the New Year and were absolutely in love with it We were given an upgraded room because it was our honeymoon so we had a huge room with fireplace balcony winter so not really useful a arate bedroom arate shower with huge soaker tub and a very well stocked kitchenette  The service was absolutely unbeatable    the staff were always polite helpful and very prompt if we needed wood towels or reservations  We were surprised with a unique New Years Gift and were always delighted with the turn down service with weather report in the evenings The free breakfast was okay we prefer Eggspectations but free is free We did not eat in the restaurant for dinner but heard others rave about it  We also used the massage therapists in the gym and both my husband and I had amazing massages that were well worth the money  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the Sulpice and would stay there again actually we are planning our next trip to Montreal already 
P => New Years in Montreal My boyfriend and I spent New Years Eve in Montreal and based on the wonderful reviews on this site chose Le Saint Sulpice  Everything was wonderful right from arrival  Staff was extremely friendly and accomodating  Our deluxe suite was huge The bathroom was beautiful with a tub and erate shower  The or was very modern  There was a frosted glass wall between the bedroom and bath which added an interesting touch  The lobby was absolutely gorgeous with beautiful or and a fireplace  Old Montreal is classic and beautiful especially in winter  We both slept wonderfully in the comfy bed  I especially loved the pillows We had wonderful room service   the wild mushroom appetizer and vegetable soup were exquisite and the presentation beautiful  After we checked out and before we headed home we also had dinner in their restaurant quotS Le Restaurantquot which was phenomenal  I recommend the wild mushroom appetizer and the ceasar salad with smoked salmon  My boyfriend had the mallard entree which he enjoyed as well  The only complaint we have is that our dessert took almost  minutes to come to the table However we were able to overlook that since the rest of our stay was perfect 
P => Good place to stay in Montreal    We chose Le St Sulpice because of Tripadvisor reviews and stayed there for a few days after Christmas  Overall its a great place to stay in Montreal  Situated in Old Montreal we found the location very convenient  There are a number of great restaurants located less than  minutes away on foot  We enjoyed Eggspectation just off Place dArmes and went there every day for a delicious breakfast Despite it being mid winter ok a mild one for Montreal but still up to   degrees we were able to walk around the immediate area and up to Downtown  We stayed in a Deluxe Suite which was very spacious  Ask if you want a bath   they dont all have one  Service in the hotel was very good   immediate responses by staff when we asked for anything  A few specific points The restaurant is very nice   we had a good meal and were able to have dessert in the room which was nice while the fold away beds are a elty we didnt really see the point with such huge hotel rooms the rooms are very dimly lit despite several lamps dotted around   one good light wouldnt go amiss housekeeping was a bit variable   be depending on who made up the room and the fact that the hotel allows dogs means that you occasionally hear a bark coming from the corridor or the room next door The internet connection is reliable and free of charge which was also a plus for us  All in all wed come back to this hotel  It provided value for money for what is a very luxurious hotel in a good spot  
P => Best Honeymoon ever We stayed at the St  Sulpice for our honeymoon and had a wonderful time  We were upgraded to a suite with a fireplace balcony and arate bedroom  The staff were excedingly helpful and kind and the service was great  Despite our floor being full there was almost no noise  At all  We plan to go back the next time were in Montreal  
P => Stress free stay A great hotel As previous reviews mentioned excellent service was housed here and all the staff that we interacted with were polite smiling and helpful  The room was a deluxe suite    Very nice size bedroom was great and the bathroom was extremely comfy  The room also had a kitchenette with pots and dishes provided if you really want to cook  Two tvs in the room one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area  The negatives were bad food via room service just luke warm and bland and albeit still a nice bathroom the tiles were starting to get warn  All that aside and you have still have a great hotel in Old Montreal  Approx   min walk to the Metro Notre Dame station liquor store near by min away and lots of great restuarants  Dont go to Eggspectations across from the Cathedral   its average food and packed with tourists  Try a little cafe or restaurant within Old Montreal  Ask the concierge Enjoy  
P => Great hotel thanks to happy staff This is a great apartment hotel in Old Montreal  The room was spacious and comfortable with a really luxurious bathroom  Tthe public areas were very stylish except for the restaurant which was a bit dark and severe for breakfast  However the thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff   they seem to genuinely enjoy working there which made it a pleasure to stay there  When the wireless connection in our room didnt work four people arrived one after the other to sort the problem out till it was fixed  The location is great for sightseeing although many of the restaurants nearby are touristy and mediocre  Montreal  grew on us as a city and if we returned we would be delighted to stay at St Sulpice again  
P => Fabulous boutique hotel When can I go back I recently returned from Montreal after honeymooning for about a week at Le Saint Sulpice  The hotel was magnificent My husband called in advance of our trip to request an early check in and we were able to get into our room upon arrival  We had a deluxe suite on the th floor that faced the courtyard  The bathroom was very nice with a large bathtub and huge shower  The bedroom was small but very cozy and romantic  The bed was amazingly comfortable  We also had a fireplace and a lovely balcony  I highly recommend a balcony  I spent a lot of time sipping my morning coffee and evening wine while watching the activity in the courtyard  On another note continental breakfast was included with our rate and available in the restaurant until  AM  And nightly turn down service was provided  Le Saint Sulpice is perfectly located in the heart of Vieux Montreal  Highlights located nearby include the museum Pointe   Calli re the bar at the Hotel Place dArmes and the restaurant Le Club Chasse et Peche Make sure to escape the tourists though and head to other areas of town  We had great bagels in Montreals Mile End neighborhood and smoked meat sandwiches at Schwartzs on St  Laurent  For a fabulous brewpub go to Dieu du Ciel on Laurier Ave  For sushi go to  I also on Laurier  The English area of town around Crescent Street is also worth checking out  We bar hopped starting at the Winston Churchill Pub   For a clubby Manhattan ish experience go to Cavalli on Peel  For you gamblers spend an evening at the massive Casino de Montreal  We won 
P => A most comfortable hotel Our family of  with  teens stayed at Le Saint Sulpice during the first week in  in a suite with sleepercouch which worked out perfectly  What became a pleasant surprise was the efficient and gracious professionalism of the staff the comfort level of the accomodation and the convenient location of this beautiful hotel While located in Old Montreal next to Notre Dame it never felt as if we were stuck in the midst of the touristy section of the city  A metro stop is within a couple of blocks while the shopping district of St  Catharine is only a little further We would definitely consider giving this establishment a return visit the next time we are in Montreal  
P => Le Saint Sulpice a great  boutique  hotel  Excellent service  A super quotboutiquequot hotel in the old part of Montreal   Very good service  Good size bathrooms  Free high speed Internet   Superb restaurant in the hotel courtyard   Before leaving Montreal and out of curiosity I went to vist  other boutique hotels as well in old part of Montreal and theSaint Suplice hotel is the best  Definitively I will stay again at the Saint Sukpice during my next trips to Montreal Many excellent restaurants nearby  For indian food lovers try the excellent GANDHi restaurant nearby  
P => perfect for families Perfectly situated in Old Montreal very pleasant staff large roomsamp tastefully orated  perfect for families with children as our room had a arate bedroom suite allowing us to put the kids to bed and enjoy a glass of wine and conversation without fear of waking them  lots of child friendly activities in the area   waterfront park with paddle boats horseampbuggy rides museums insectarium min drive etc etc  best hotel in Montreal tho Gault is a close second without kids  will stay again  
P => Le Saint Sulpice A Great Hotel I just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and we were very pleased My husband myself and our  year old dhter stayed in a deluxe suite and it was great Very spacious and clean  The Hotel itself is beautiful and in a perfect location in Old Montreal  We were able to walk to most places and had many great choices of restaurants around the Hotel  The staff was very kind and we look forward to our return to Le Saint Sulpice 
P => A great hotel in a great location The hotel is absolutely stunning  The lobby is pretty and capacious  The staff was very gregarious and helpful with everything from picking restaurants to driving directions  Our room was huge and very nice  The beds were comfortable and very cozy  If there was one negative about the hotel it was the breakfast  Not that the food wasnt good it was the fact that the same exact food was served each day so it became somewhat mundane and boring  The hotel is in an optimal location near all the popular attractions in both the old city and downtown Montreal  One word of advice if you are looking for chinese food and the hotel reccomends quotThe Beijingquot DO NOT GO it was absolutely horrible  Other than that everything was wonderful 
P => Excellent across the board We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice   and found it a virtually flawless environment  The staff was uniformly excellent and the accommodations st and clean if a bit tight for a family of   Recommendations amp reservations for restaurants culturalsportingoutdoor activities    whatever you want were all addressed promptly and effectively  I travel a lot and this hotel is now at the top of my list  
P => Wonderful Stay My husband and I stayed here for  nights in ust  The hotel staff were always friendly and accomodating and answered all our questions  The room was wonderful    tons of room comfortable seating nice view of the street  I wasnt too keen on the bed    it was rather too firm for my taste but I didnt really expect anything different  My only complaint would be about the maid service  While they do way more than I would expect like washing the dishes we used from the kitchenette it was a constant battle to keep our toilet paper and tissues replenished  We finally left a good tip for housekeeping and got some toilet paper  I almost think this is housekeepings way of getting back at the people staying in hotels this seems to happen more often than not and not just at this hotel  The rooms were clean linens fresh many extras available that normally arent at other hotels and the room service was superb 
P => Love Canada Ive stayed here a few times now with my wife  Love it and its location  Try the Le Keg Restaurant  
P => Right across the street from Hotel Nelligan Spent four nights here in y  This hotel is beautiful serene comfortable and relaxing  We loved the concierge staff especially Patrick More wonderful restaurants within a five minute walk than you can patronize in a month long stay  Metro station is  minutes walk towards Chinatown Our deluxe one bedroom suite was big comfortable stylish  Love having a fridge  We didnt eat at the hotel too many awesome choices nearby This great hotel is  feet and  a night away from Hotel Nelligan  What a bargain for a great hotel in a terrific location If you stay exit hotel lobby turn right walk  block and turn right  Walk another block  Across from the old customs building  current gift shop for the archeology museum is a charming little bistrodeli that has great breakfast lunch snacks for very modest prices  Walk another  block and you find a little downtown convenience store that sells whatever you forgot at home plus sodas and beer to put in your rooms fridge You dont need coffee cream though  Each time the room is cleaned the complimentary bowl of single serve   milks and half and half creamers will be replenished  How great is that 
P => Great jewel in Montreal Great hotel the rooms are spacious and furnished nicely  The hotel is not much for night life as for the bar but everything is just a walk or metro ride away  Old Montreal is where it is located and it is awesome lovely views and so many little places to walk into for coffee dinner or wine  The staff were helpful and eager to assist and were not looking for tips all the time  Typically we stay at Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton  This hotel is our choice for Montreal  People said the Murphy bed was not comfortable but we slept perfect  Bathroom is large and plently of room for things on the counter and such  Nice touch also to have great huge windows that open for fresh air  
P => Elegant spacious suite in a perfect location  Excellent spa Bonus Loved this place Not sure if all rooms are suites but ours was  two sets of windows opening onto lovely courtyard complete with a wedding ceremonyreception to watch on our first evening with our fellow third floor residents  While not the full balcony we had hoped for the windows opened enough so that it felt like it  One night we had a torrential downpour and it was so romantic to open up the windows lean on the rail and watch the lightning and listen to the rain fall while staying dry   Water was delivered daily the doormen and concierge were always attentive every amenity was available and the accupressure massage in the spa was put simply the best Ive ever had  If they had an open appointment we would have gotten a pedicure as well You cannot beat the location  the waterfront two blocks away all of the old city at your doorstep the metro within  yards Only two suggestions higher thread count sheets would be nice and staff need to give more precise directions to restaurants  We missed a reservation because we hunted for the place we were sent without success even with the map The price was right and I have been raving about all the St  Sulpice since I got home  Thanks for a memorable th anniversary 
P => Great Location Great Hotel My wife and I have stayed at many hotels in Montreal over the years mostly on business  This year we ided to go up for the Comedy Fest John Cleese was phenomal and to stay in Old Montreal  Based on Trip Advisor reviews we chose the Saint Sulpice and we couldnt be more pleased  For doing the just plain touristy things that Montreal is great for the hotel was perfectly located   a block or two from the waterfront bike paths to everywhere ambience galore  The room was large modern and quiet  The bed was great Agree with other posters about the restaurant   forget it   but in all other regards this is a great hotel for a fair price  The location makes me prefer it to the other top rated Montreal hotels  
P => Great Hotel As usual I went by the previous reviews of hotels on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed  Le Saint Sulpice is in the old part of Montreal I cant imagine staying anywhere else if you are in Montreal and the location is perfect  Its next to Notre Dame on a quiet one way street and easy walking distance to everything including the port  The lobby is not large nor breathtaking like some high end hotels but it is tastefully orated and elegant  All of the staff was helpful courteous and non intrusive  In fact our porter didnt even wait for a tip and genuinely acted like it was his pleasure to take our bags upstairs  Our room was very large and had a little kitchen containing a stove potspans dishes and silverware plus a large seating area with a couch that opened up to a bed  The huge windows opened out slightly tricky too open but they seal extremely well and block out the noise to a small courtyard and the dining area for the restaurant  I think some rooms have french doors opening to the courtyard but the balconies are small and not for lounging  I loved the bathroom with the neoclassical vanity and the large glass walk in shower is a dream  While I cant say I visited a lot of hotels in Montreal I can say that you will not be disappointed with Le Saint Sulpice especially compared to the chain hotels there which looked like they could be in any American city  
P => Very average I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  The problem with this one is it is average  It is full of promise but it lacks the finish  Personally I would pay a little more and get a more memorable and unique visit The BadgtFriday night the Conceirge has left before  Concierge made a dubious restaurant recommendation  One was good the other was a half empty restaurant during the Just for Lhs festival with good food average or and mediocre service Breakfast is awful and best avoided  It is also served in the lower restaurant not the beautiful patio  This really is a shame as it is one of the better features Hard to get a table at times to have a drink on the terrace if you are not eating  This is a problem as there is no bar other than the lower restaurantThe rooms look great but they feel pretty flimsy to the touch The night table drawer still had someones condoms still in the packagesand lube in them discovered as we were leaving    UHGG  The front desk did nothing other than look disgusted The GoodgtThe location is great The staff are friendly It is not too expensive Although I would rather pay a little more and get a more unique and memorable experienceIt is quiet and likely suited to business travel If you can budget for more you should  If this is a stretch you will likely get good value  
P => Great hotel and superb location Just returned from a romantic trip to Montreal for our anniversary  The St Sulpice is a wonderful hotel   and the location cant be beat  The staff is friendly and helpful   the rooms are wonderful we had a suite with a balcony overlooking the garden restaurant  and we really enjoyed our stay  The jardin restaruant wasnt too great though  We had a fairly bad meal one night overcooked beef and uninspired vegetables and it was disappointing after such a great stay at the hotel  But as far as the hotel was concerned we highly reccommend Le St Sulpice  
P => Great place to stay This was my first visit to Montreal  I asked a friend where to stay and he suggested Old Montreal  If you are going to stay in Old Montreal I cannot imagine a better location than the Saint Sulpice  Located one block behind the Basilica and one block from the waterfront and science museum everything in Old Montreal is at your footsteps  Each hotel room is a suite  The suites are more like a large hotel room with a wall to arate the bedroom  The staff is superb  I communicated with the concierge before my stay to determine the best place to eat and things to do  They were very cooperative  I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => tres bon We stayed at the St  Sulpice from e      The rooms are very comfortable and spacious  Our deluxe suite had a sitting area with pull out queen and a small bedroom with frosted french doors   this provided some but not complete privacy  The suite was appointed exactly as you would expect for a boutique hotel  It was perfect for our family of four including one teenager  Plenty of storage for clothes The rooms were very clean and best of all very quiet   there was no noise from above the street or the hallway   the room doors are recessed slightly and this  have helped  Our room faced St  Paul Street which tended to be very quiet from  p m  on and then into mid morning  There was a building being reated directly across the street so it did not make for the best view but overall was charming  The location is excellent  It is a block or so away from the very commercial and touristy section of St  Paul and you can easily walk to area restaurants and attractions  If you walk down St  Pauls in the opposite direction you come across more boutique type shops and less touristy places to eat along with art galleries  The breakfast was just so so  Skip it and go to Claude Postel one block away or Olive and Gourmando two blocks down St  Paul  The work out room was small but suitable  The staff were very eager to assist and provided great service  The valet was very timely and pleasant  The front desk folks did give us a few vague directions and some incomplete information but otherwise were great  We attended an Alsace wine tasting in the garden   which was so pleasant   it is too bad they do not serve breakfast out there   it is also fun for an after dinner drink  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again  
P => This hotel is beautiful comfortable and has a great location This is really a great place to stay  The rooms are spacious beautiful and so comfortable and relaxing  They have a contemporary restaurant and a comfortable terrace full of gazebos and lush with plants that is lovely Old Montreal is a wonderful location and there are loads of places to eat and shop around it  We stayed at the Intercontinental previously and by comparison we really loved the Saint Suplice  and paid much less money You wont be sorry   its just the best value and worth much more  
P => Great Service From the arrival to the check out time the staff was friendly knowledgeable and always ready to assist The Houseman was friendly and smiling in the corridors  All the staff is bilingual which is a great asset for us coming from the country next door The location is perfect on  rue St Sulpice  by one of the most famous Church in Montreal do not plan to visit it on Saturday and Sunday unless you get ried yourself The underground city in Montreal is something to seeGreat restaurants in the old city  Ask Patrick the Concierge to assist you in planning your stay  You won t regret itOnce again thank you for making it an exceptional stay  
P => St  Sulpice is the Best Just a reconfirmation of the other postive reviews  I stayed at the hotel for seven days which can really put a strain on your relationship with a hotel  Not so with the St  Sulpice  everything was excellent from the room to the service  The location near the Palais de Congress was excellent on top of being in old Montreal  
P => As wonderful as everyone else has said A group of us stayed here while attending a convention at Palais de Congres for an entire week and this hotel was as incredible as all the other reviewers have said  To save money we tripled up in the rooms but it was still comfortable quiet and lovely  The pull down Murphy bed was extremely comfortable and the down comforter a real treat  My colleague who slept on the sofa bed really like that  now thats the k of a good hotel when one of those is comfortable Everything about the hotel was spectacular and when I next return to Montreal this will be the place I come back to  
P => Another wonderful stay This is the second time Ive stayed at the St  Sulpice and I have to say that they still managed to quotwowquot both my girlfriend and I The room we got was facing Rue St  Paul this time and it made for a nice time of just gazing outside at the people walking about  Toiletries were from LOccitane instead of another brand which I cant remember the name of right now which was certainly a nice luxe touch Concierge again was great and always gets us the best table at restaurants even on a short half hour notice Our room had a faulty climate control but after getting housekeeping who were just in the hallway at the time to try and fix it they ended up calling for the maintenance tech  A quick fix later and the room was cooled down nicely All in all a great stay yet again 
P => Ahhh the spa Ive written a review on this hotel previously but stayed there again last week and wanted to add something  They have a tiny little spa really just a couple of rooms at the side of the workout area but dont let the size turn you away  I had a  minute massage from a registered massage therapist that was only  Cdn  Not only is that about half what most hotel spas charge but its  less than I pay at home  Ditto for a wonderful facial  Oh and if you like good cheeses order the Quebec cheese plate from room service  It is in the dessert section of the menu  It had three cheeses and assorted dried and fresh fruit and was more than enough for dinner for me  
P => As promised Just returned from a wonderful  day trip to the city of Montreal and a very satisfying stay at the Hotel Le Saint Sulpice in the Vieux Montreal section of the city  We arrived late on a Thursday and were given an upgrade to an exec  suite which was roomy and comfortable w a fireplace and a spacious k  All the rooms are suites of varying size so I wouldnt want to mislead anyone but as I said this room was ideal  My wife enjoyed a   hr massage in their spa which is not luxe but nonetheless clean and comfortable  Theres that word again  All told the hotel is very well located the staff extremely friendly and helpful and we would return to the Saint Sulpice in an instant  
P => st class hotel you wont go wrong This small hotel  a block from the Notre Dame Cathedral is a gem  Before we even put the car in park a bellman was at our door waiting to assist us From that point forward this great hotel exceeded our expcations  The room was a mini suite with a modern but inviting ore  The dinner suggestions provided were excellent and the staff professional  Im sure you can guess that my wife and I will be back again and again  
P => We want to stay here forever From the minute we arrived everything was superb  The rooms the staff the food the cocktailsA beautiful hotel in probably one of the best locations in the city not far from the metro but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city Only negative comment was on checkout we travelled with friends who had a car and they tried to charge both parties for car parking but they sorted it in the end despite there being no apology for the mistake 
P => Beautiful place We stayed at this hotel for  nights in early ch  Our stay at this hotel did not get off to a promising start  The confirmation e mail we received from the hotel stated that we would get  a room with fireplace OR balcony  well a balcony in early ch in Montreal     The lady at reception had a little bit of an attitude later on she asked me to show some ID in order to make a new keycard because my old one didn t work anymore by that time we d been at the hotel for  days and she d only seen me walking in and out about a hundred times  I should add that she was the ONLY person we found a bit unfriendly the GUYS were all great Anyway she immediately told us that no rooms with a fireplace were available at all  Sorry but we have   occupancy   At this my husband got a bit annoyed and she started click clacking on her computer for a while in the end she said that a room with a fireplace would become available the next day  However she stressed that that room would be exactly the same as the room we would get in the first place the only difference being that it had a wood burning fireplace  We ided to check out the new room the next morning and ide then  The room we got on the first night was quite large a real suite and very clean  And it did in fact have a gas fireplace though not a wood burning one  However it was a bit long and narrow and more importantly it was VERY hot it appeared that the thermostat wasn t working so we had no way to lower the heat The next day we went to check out the  other  room the lady at reception once again stressed that apart from the fireplace this room was exactly the same  However this room proved to be HUGE much larger than our old one with two bedrooms and two bathrooms all like everything else in the hotel very clean and in immaculate condition  Also it was cool   thermostat functioning just fine here  So our ision was an easy one   we moved immediately  I should also note that the Hotel St  Sulpice was absolutely quiet no sound to be heard either from the street or from inside the hotel  The only exception was in our new room the sound of we thought some heating installation just above our head we were on the th   top  floor of the hotel which we could hear  whooshing  and clunking  But we very quickly got used to this and it didn t bother us at all Apart from our somewhat shaky start I have nothing but positives to report about this hotel  Friendly and helpful staff very very quiet excellent housekeeping  We had a wonderful housekeeper in fact   a very cheerful lady from Ghana who showed up at  in the morning  So our room had been done by the time we finished breakfast The restaurant was excellent and the bar while perhaps a tad on the small side very cosy with friendly barkeepers  Nice complimentary breakfast we had the continental one but it was more than adequate  And again friendly and quick service both at breakfast and at dinner  Fantastic location within  minutes walking distance from lots of restaurants bars art galleries etc  etc  But in spite of all this the hotel itself was very quiet as said  So on the whole we had a very very positive experience at this hotel   much recommendedWe also checked out several other hotels in Old Montreal I would like to give my impressions below  Please note that we did NOT stay at these places so these are just our first impressionsAuberge Bonaparte  We did not stay here but an acquaintance of ours who was in Montreal at the same time did  He was extremely positive about the hotel  We had dinner at the restaurant and it was excellent  Great atmosphere in the lobby too   staff appeared very friendly  On the whole the hotel seemed somewhat less  upscale  than St  Sulpice but of course it was quite a bit cheaper too Hotel Nelligan  Looked like an absolute winner to us This is the place we would like to try next time we are in Montreal  Like St  Sulpice the lobby is spacious but the atmosphere is warmer  Large bar with unusually lots of different draft beers  Fantastic layout   we loved the courtyard and the easy chairs  Excellent service too  Dinner at the restaurant Verses is certainly the best we ve had while in Montreal  Hotel XIe siecle  Checked this out briefly  It looked very nice basic unpretentious and very  bookish   Lots of books in the lobby   people reading working at their laptops etc  Our sort of place for sure Le St  James  We had an excellent cup of coffee here  Wow what a place This has got to be one of Montreal s most expensive hotels and it shows  A beautiful building perfectly kept and furnishing extremely polite and friendly waiters all silver coffee service   everything just perfect and VERY chic  If we would have just a little more money or if the hotel has some packages at a reduced price we d love to stay here Auberge du Vieux Port  Again checked it out briefly  Great location right on the water on one side and on one of Montreal s most touristy streets but nice on the other side  The hotel itself looked fairly basic and unpretentious with a small but friendly  and cosy looking lobby  Definitely worth a try Hotel des Armes  Actually we didnt really check out this hotel  We did attempt to have dinner at the hotel s restaurant Suite   But after have waited near the entrance for five minutes or so and having been totally ignored by the waiters who were occupied with the few guests we left  We didn t like the atmosphere and also we found it significant that on evening when just about all restaurants were quite full this one was almost empty  So we ided to forget about the hotel  
P => Another great stay at St Sulpice This was my second trip to Montreal and my second stay at St Sulpice  I absolutely love this hotel  The service is top notch staff is friendly and helpful  I paid the additional nightly fee for a suite to avoid the Murphy bed  To me its worth the  or so extra per night to have so much additional space and a comfortable bed  We had another lovely suite  this time with a fireplace  The bathroom was larger than our suite from last year  we had a double sink and did not have the frosted glass btwn the bath amp bedroom  Only disappointment in this layout was that the bedroom did not have a dressing table  However we did have a larger living room I love that they remember little details  like the personalized business cards upon check in the nightly bottled water and the card showing the weather forecast for the next day  Ive read reviews here before about the free breakfast  once again I didnt try the breakfast  There is a fabulous pastry shop about four doors down on Notre Dame called Claude Postel  Drag yourself out of bed and spend the money you would have spent tipping the waitstaff for the free hotel breakfast at Claude Postel  Its worth it Even in the bitter cold As long as CP is open I dont think I will ever eat the hotel breakfast We ate dinner on our last night at the S Restaurant in the hotel  The food was tasty but not very adventurous and was more expensive than some of the delicious meals we had during the weekend  It was what I expeceted food to be at a hotel of this calibur Spa staff was great front desk staff was very helpful valet was prompt with our car room was clean and neat  Another wonderful stay at this hotel  cant wait to return 
P => Fantastic boutique hotel Stayed at the St  Sulpice for my birthday  I would have to say the staff is the friendliest and most attentive staff i have ever experienced  ien the concierge was great and had everything i requested perfect he went above and beyond  The rooms are spacious and comfortable  My wife and I had a hard time getting motivated to leave the bed it was so comfortable  The rooms with the real fireplaces are the way to go  The only drawback was no lobby bar but I do recommend the bar at the hotel Nelligan just around the corner  For a bit more uptempo lounge walk one block to the club   Great location walking distance to Gibbys and short cab ride to Le Que De Chaval  You will not be disappointed in this hotel  
P => Loved Le Saint Sulpice a little gem in old Montreal We stayed at the Saint Suplice for  nights just before Christmas and thought this boutique hotel was delightful  The room was spacious and very well equipped  The staff were outstanding so helpful and informative they could not do enough for us  The location of the hotel is a stones throw away from some good restaurants in the Old Town and although it is a  minute walk to the main shopping area it is lovely to escape back to Old Montreal and this hotel at the end of the day  Would definitely receommend it  
P => I really wanted to like this property    but       I really wanted to like this property  The location behind the Cathedral Notre Dame in Old Montreal is perfect  Most of the staff tries very hard to please more on that in a second  Its quieter and less of a scene than most hotels Ive stayed at here But   Theres something weird about the rooms  Mine had a TV but no stereo CD player or anything but a clock radio  The furniture and carpets need an update    scratches rips stains all over  Not the end of the world but not what you want from a property aiming for four stars  Sheets and towels look a little worn About the staff Almost all of them are courteous friendly and accommodating  But the women who work at the weird little gym on the th floor seem seriously unhappy  While I exercised one day they amused themselves by draping the large guest towels around their heads and waists and prancing around   not the most professional behavior  
P => Nice hotel but not for everyone First off I want to say that the hotel is a nice property with great staff in a beautiful area  But I think it really depends what you are looking for and what your preference is  For my wife and I we didnt realize until staying at st  sulpice that we prefer a cozy but good size hotel room over a suite hotel room with kitchenette and living area space  I think these rooms are ideal for people who have a family or have friends over to enjoy a drink before a night on the town  If thats the case st  sulpice cant be beat  As for the location its ideal for old montreal but its still a  minute walk or so up to saint catherine  There are many other hotels which are located more in the middle  minutes to old montreal  minutes to downtown  But again if staying in Old Montreal is your thing the location cant be beat  Another thing which I noticed on tripadvisor were the comments about the murphy bed  I agree there is simply no need for it and its not all that comfortable  The room is big enough I wont need to put the bed back into the wall to save space Also the shower wall which you can see the shadows from the living room just doesnt make alot of sense  Im into chic and trendy things but I found this unnecessary So I dont want to be too hard on st  sulpice I did give it  because although its not exactly what my wife and I were looking for it could be ideal for others  
P => Wedding proposal blessed by the Sulpice gods Ive recently stayed at the St Sulpice as I wanted a special place to do my wedding proposal  One day before my arrivalI called the concierge Patrick who ended up working miracles for me  I told him do whatever it takes to make it nice fuzzy warm and romantic  He had the flowers the rose petals the music the candles the fireplace the violonist the champagne the strawberries etc  His ideas were unlimited  Of course my girlfriend said YES Nonetheless the room was charming the rest of the staff was way up to par more so than many hotels Ive traveled in  This staff takes their job to heart and it shows  Great bellmen and frontdesk clerks  Very few names I remembered cause they were all great  Dave Rafel Mike ian y Helen  Wow St Sulpice you know what it takes to be on the top BRAVO I will definitely come back in remembrance of this day  Thank you all for your great work 
P => Perfect in every way We travel a great deal and stay priily in  star hotels  Although this hotel is not quite in that category we chose it because of the old world charm of both the building and environment and we were not disappointed  Weve stayed  times with teenaged dhters and the extra space was welcome and very affordable  Great bars and restaurants nearby and the hotel staff went over and above to accommodate our every desire  
P => Everything we had hoped for Went to Montreal for a weekend with my three sisters last tember We had booked a suite on the rd flour  It was everything we had hoped for and more The beds were confortable the bathroom was beautiful and the service was excellent The dining room were we had our breakfast was very nice and comfortable the food excellent and the service also excellent In old Montreal and not far from many other attractions An experience by itself Will certainly go back at that magnificent hotel  
P => St  Wonderful Stayed at the St  Sulpice for a week starting    Very enjoyable experience great front desk nothing seemed too much trouble  The suite we had was romantic well laid out and I really loved the bathroom with probably the best selection of toiletries around  Right in old Montreal but deadly quiet  Will be booking again 
P => A delight in Montreal Le St  Sulpice did not disappoint in any aspect  The room was stylish spacious and very comfortable  Linens were lovely  Housekeeping was attentive and thorough The desk staff was efficient and helpful  My three nights there were delightful and I would head back again on a return trip to Montreal  A great find thanks to Montreal friends was the Brunoise restaurant at  St  Andre  The food was delicious the wine quite good and the cost about  US for a three course meal for two and bottle of wine  Toque was another story the tasting menu with wine for two was  US  The menu is a mystery so you do not know what you are ordering  Perhaps the mystery is necessary I would not have ordered it had I known what was to be included  Service was spotty another tables entree was served to methen picked up and served at that table  Large baskets of bread were served I noticed that the bread was devoured at all the tables ordering the tasting menu  Given the slow service and minute portions think one scallop in its shell the bread was the staple of the evening  
P => Nice hotel  We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for three nights following a cruise in late tember   It is a very nice hotel and the location is excellent  We had a one bedroom suite that was well appointed but I will offer a couple of areas that could be improved In the bedroom there is no place to put a suitcase so short of unpacking everything it is a bit annoying  The door knob to the bedroom fell off the first time my wife touched it  Fortunately it missed her foot as the hotel uses nothing but heavy high quality fixtures  The housekeeping staff did not vacume the carpets at any time during our stay  As we had some very high winds and lousy weather one day there was quotstuffquot on the carpet that needed attention The staff were very professional and courteous  We would stay here again given the opportunity  Be aware of the significant room taxes when you book  
P => Excellent in all respects Last week we planned to spend three days at the Saint Sulpice and ended up with four days due to car problems  The folks at this hotel were extremely helpful working through our car problems and were always thinking ahead    for example inquiring about calling ahead to cancel our planned stay in Quebec City when the car broke down providing a quotwait roomquot for my wife after checking out while I spent the day at the car dealer trying to get the car repaired The hotel was superb in all respects somewhat modern in its appointments  Our room on the th floor had a ently sized wrap around balcony with a wonderful suite    that included a woodburning fireplace and a small kitchenette  Location was excellent adjoining Notre Dame and perfectly located in the Old City If you like quality and want to be in Old Montreal youll be very satisfied with this hotel  
P => Impressive We have just returned from the Saint Sulpice Hotel in Montreal after a  day mini holiday and I must say  this is a very impressive small hotel  European in flavour the suites are spacious very clean and in our suite we enjoyed  bedrooms  baths with glass top counters fireplace and windows that opened to view the small streets and sounds of old Montreal  The mini bar was well stocked in our kitchenette but the price to sample any of the liquour or juices was way too high  The hotel is in a great location in old Montreal with Notre Dame Basilica right next door  Close to quaint bistros and cafes you are never far from great dining  We found the hotel restaurant a bit pricey and somewhat limited in choices  However the staff was friendly and helpful and I would not hesitate to stay here again  All in all a lovely hotel 
P => beautiful boutique hotel in Old Montreal We stayed last fall and it was beautiful   The fireplace   The room was pretty big and had a little seating area   We loved it and the location was great  
P => St Terrific First off all I dont know why the other reviews talk down about the Murphy Bed  It was just a trendy furniture with a real mattress  Ive stayed previously with my girlfriend in a Deluxe closed bedroom last time and I can assure you that it is the same mattress and firmness with a tad of heavenly soft on the top  Now to the good stuff  As it was our second stay we knew very well where we were going  The hotel is super well located in the heart of Old Montreal behind the Notre Dame Basilica which is holding an Exhibition on the artifacts of the Vaticans museum  You should go and have a look  WOWThe staff as usual was very pleasant and helpful  Some of them even recognized us from a year before  I took the time to remember some of the names of many good employees such as Michael Rafal Dave Luis and the lovely Anthea  Although we had been here before we made sure to look for the Chef Concierge Patrick who had given us great restaurant recommendations last time  He gave us the  on what was happening and the new restaurants we should try out and the new whereabouts for shopping  Wow Once again he didnt fell us and sent us to great eating places Club Chasse et Peche Version Laurent Godbout Europea and Boris Bistro  Last but not least we had been referred by ien to try out the lunch on the MAGNIFICENT terrasse in the back  They have this hidden garden located in the back of the hotel and the kitchen cooks BBQ grilled meat and vegetables outside in front of you  Food was delicious and the service way up there just like the hotel  I took time to remember two fantastic waiters Bo and Etiene I think In sum all I can say is that becoming the best is easy but staying the best is the hardest part and all of you at the St Sulpice seemed to know what it takes to stay on TOP  Great job and keep it up 
P => A Wonderful Stay My husband and I stayed at Le St  Sulpice on ust  and ust  due to flight connections going to and from Metis Sur  Mer  We chose this hotel based upon Trip Advisor reviews  Our room reservations were booked directly through the hotel  We chose the quotdeluxe room suitequot which had a very comfortable queen bed and a arate murphy bed in the livingroom  The hotel website gave excellent room rate package options  Our room was exceptionally clean and I value the large window which opened over the courtyard  We kept the window open for fresh air and didnt need the air conditioning system  It appears we got an upgrade by having a top floor room which had city and courtyard views  As per earlier reviews food service is excellent at Le Restaurant but the breakfast buffet was quotstandardquot fare  We did like the convenience of the restaurant opening at am  The hotel staff was excellent very attentive and friendly  Location is the best with the Basilica right next door and we easily walked everywhere in Old Montreal Chinatown and Downtown  We rate this hotel as one of the best we have stayed in  
P => Its true the beds are very hard Stayed from y  to y   The location is great  Lots to do within walking distance The murphy bed is very hard  We told the front desk and they placed a thin feather bed on the mattress  It really helped The room was not vacuumed our enitire stay  The hallway was not vacuumed for four days The rooms on the street are very noisy In spite of all of this we had a great time in Montreal  
P => Great Hotel   Excellent staff Myfriend and I stayed at Le Saint Sulpice ust   basd on the superior reviews posted on this website  Our experience validated the reviews Le Saint Sulpice is a boutique hotel located in Old Montreal Le Vieux Montreal right next to the Notre Dame Basilica  We found the location to be perfect  We walked to the main shopping areas Chinatown the Metro etc  Every inch of the hotel seems to be immaculately clean  the lobby the corriders and especially the rooms  We had a standard one bedroom suite which was beautifully orated with modern furnishings  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable  The only oddity was the Murphy Bed  I dont understand the need for it  The minibar had enough room for all the snacks we picked up and the kitchenette was very functional  Special mention to the excellent staff   we were greeted by the doorman Luis and Rafal  Great Job Our numberous questions were easily answereed by Michel  Antony and k   the front desk team   Great work guys  You made our trip 
P => Nice Place We stayed at Le St  Sulpice from       It is a very nice hotel in Old Montreal  Basically all the past reviews are true  The service is excellent and the hotel is good  CONCIERGEAs it was our th anniversary I had called the concierge to have a nice bottle of Champagne waiting and I wanted a CD player  Both were there  I also had him make dinner reservations for us  he made them at Modavie a short walk away  I did it all by email ROOMStayed in the room with the Murphy Bed  We werent offered an upgrade which I was hoping for  About that Murphy Bed I dont understand the need for it  Why not a regular bed AND yes it was NOT comfortable  Very hard and thin  Neither my husband or I slept well  That glass wallpanel from the bathroom was sort of strange  The bathroom light would light up the bed room  We didnt like that Fireplace  UGLY electric fireplace  While it  add some ambiance to the room be in the winter it took up MUCH space  And was VERY UGLY Furniture was comfortable  My husband loved the leather chair  I actually slept on the sofa our rd night because my back couldnt take the bed another night  I didnt open it up  just slept on top of it  The kitchenette was cute and looked efficient  We didnt use it  just the refridgerator  AC was good  no problems  We had a nightly turndown  nice touch  Daily paper  English  The bathroom except that glass wall is simply STUNNING  The soaking tub was to die for Toiletries okay  BTW  the quotbetterquot rooms get LOccitane  I felt a little insulted  I was paying ALOT of  too took some LOccitane shampoo from the housekeeper cart though  shame on me     There was virtually no noise from the street when the windows were shut  That was nice because it is in a very busy neighborhood  Robes were soft and comfy BREAKFASTIt was okay  It is included with most room rate packages  Astounding  dollars if you pay arately It is cold continental but for  more you can have steam table eggs amp bacon  They used THE SAME pastries everyday though Every morning there was less pastry selection and they were clearly from the day before  NOT a nice touch  They should just buy less each time so they can refresh daily  Service in restaurant breakfast was excellent  We didnt eat any other meals there VALETSome of the nicest guys Ive met Very friendly AND efficient  Dont lament the cost  there is pretty much no where to park on your own so just pay it and grin amp bear it  MINIBARLike any other SUPER expensive  We never use them  BUT CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY  we were charged for something we didnt use  We were checking our bill daily on the TV  No problem  When we told them they apologized and promptly took it off  It is in a very convenient location  Walking distance to everything in Old Montreal  Very beautiful especially while we were there You are TAXED to death in MontrealQuebec  Keep that in mind when you figure out gratuities  We got about  US back when we crossed the border  Gas is cheaper there  at least when we were there  Who knows now what with how rapidly the price is going up  MONTREAL DRIVERSCAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION And people say Massachusetts drivers are BAD  Need I say anything moreWe ate at Modavie  good Jazz band and good food The Keg  very good and reasonable pricedCant remember where else    sorry  It was an outside restaurant that was very good  right near Modavie BOTTOM LINEI WOULD recommend Le St Sulpice and I probably WOULD stay there again  Just wish they would   replace the beds    Get rid of the bathroom glass wall 
P => Great rooms service location food  My mother and I stayed at this hotel and we thought it was fabulous  The way the rooms are set up   like small suites   was just wonderful for a vacation  It was as if we each had our own room for the price of one  If one of us wanted to stay up late or get up early it wasnt a problem One night we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant  Frankly we were just expecting mediocre quothotel food quot But we were delighted at the meal and agree that for both of us it was one of the best restaurant meals we had ever had  And for two foodies from Chicago thats pretty good The concierge was great  I left my sweater in a taxi and they scoured the city and found it Wonderful 
P => One of the Best Hotels Ever We took a cab to the Saint Sulpice and were pleased at the warm hues and classy furniture in the lobby  The room was great  quiet  we faced the street  double glass  the bed was super comfy  they left coffee and real cream every nite to be made the next morning  The staff was really helpful unlike any hotel I have been in  and I have traveled in  star hotels from Rome to NY  They offered to make reservations at Gibbys steak house best one I ever ate at and I have ate at them all   Mortons Ruth Chris etc   and much cheaper The staff even called Hertz for us and got them to pay for the cab ride from the hotel to the rental agency  Montreal was hot but the air condioner was great  All the staff at the hotel speak great English  as do most Montrealers  Rent bikes down the street and take a ride down the River  When you get back to the hotel relax in the great lounge  As for the free breakfast  I am on a health diet so it left much to be desiredeggs bacon croissants etc but it was free so I nibbled on the great toast If you can afford the Saint Sulpice I cant say anything negative about it  My wife loves quotfine thingsquot and raved about the bathroom and the tolietries  plus the high tech design and lighting  and remember  these rooms are suites so that while other Hotels in the town are beautiful  you dont get the same size room that you get here  
P => Candice  My husband and I spent a few nights there this spring and were pleasantly surprised  The hotel upgraded us at check in without us asking  The suite was roomy comfortable and the bathroom was very nicely done  The only complain was the so called fireplace   a prefabricated gas unit enclosed with brick veneer it looked cheesy and unworthy a place in the room because it is nonfunctional esthetically nor practically  The concierge and doormen were very helpful and sincere  Valet parking service earns another plus  Other hotel amenities were also worth mentioning  I had the best massage at the house spa  The spagym is small but has all the essentials  The hotel restaurant was expensive for Montreal standard however they receive a  star across for the cuisine service and the atmosphere  The location of the hotel is most excellent surrounded by wonderful shops and art galleries in the heart of the Old Port  Get off the main roads if you wish to stay away from souvenir shops  
P => Great stay   great location   great rooms Took the TripAdvisor recommendations on board and booked a stay at this hotel using Expedia  Got a great rate which made the stay even better  Friendly front desk staff and concierges  The room was really good a big bath suitable for two and a arate stand up shower  Nice comfy bed and arate living room with TV   windows overlooked yard  The bonus was having a very well equipped kitchenette too  Great for making sandwiches and snacks for our trips out of the city  The fridge had plenty of room for our food too  Plenty of cutlery plates bowls and a microwave The rooms in this hotel were as good as any European hotel I have stayed in  Now what could be better The lighting in the living area was a bit too subdued and akward to control centrally  The glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom could distrub someone sleeping if someone else used the bathroom at night The restaurant and breakfasts were really good with excellent service  However some tables close to the restaurant entrance seemed to have lots of flies when we were there on several hot ust days   not a serious problem but the staff could do with managing it We went out to the rear garden restaurant one evening for a drink and it too was very dark and service was a bit slow  Car parking is extra but you are in the middle of Old or Vieux Montreal  Cab s arrived promptly on request and the local Metro station is   mins walk away giving easy access to other parts of the city Highly recommended and I will have no hesitation in staying there on future visits to Montreal   way better than one of those s  s chain hotels that claim to be  or  star  
P => Great Location Great location in the midst of Old Montreal  The highlights of the hotel were nicely appointed clean room quiet location short distance to Metro stop better than average gym and access to many good restaurants within a few blocks of hotel  Disappointed to find out that if you book with Expedia your room will not include breakfast which apparently is included for most other types of reservations  In this situation consider saving a bundle of money by eating breakfast in one of several cafes just around the corner  Also conceige was helpful with directions but restaurant recommmendations were no better than our random selections  
P => Excellent We stayed here for the last  nights of our honeymoon in y  The suite was lovely   and huge as well  Very modern but yet comfortable and the rest of the hotel was equally lovely  My husband made full use of the gym and thought is was better than a lot of hotel gyms but I have to say that the spa wasnt really worth that much of a look This is a great place to stay for a weekend break and an ideal base for exploring the city  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
P => Superb My stay at Le Saint Sulpice was wonderful  The location is prime just off the main avenues in Vieux Montreal one can walk to everything including the Metro  The lobby and public spaces are beautiful my room was spacious modern uniquely divided luxuriously appointed and comfortable  The or is rich with woods and frosted glass  Such a nice relief from the cookie cutter rooms one sees so prevelant in North American hotels  I stayed in a suite with a view of a coutyard which looked spectucular with plantings and al fresco diners at tables with white umbrellas  Service was attentive professional and courteous  Helpful concierge service was available  The included continental breakfast was standard but satisfying and served in a pleasant restaurant space  I didnt eat luch or dinner at the hotel but it appeared popular  I also didnt have an opportunity to enjoy the in hotel spa but it did look tempting  Expensive but rewarding  A real treat  
P => Le Saint Sulpice We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for a few days in y   We came to the very lovely city of Montreal for the Cirque du Soleil water show at the FINA Water Olympics  Le Saint Sulpice easy exceeded our expectations in several respects  We left quite pleased with our stay and very willing to return  Le Saint Sulpice is a boutique hotel located in Old Montreal le Vieux Montr al  The Old Montreal district is appropriately lively with a great many shops restaurants and public spaces  The streets were quite busy until very late in the evening  We had dinner at a great FrenchItalian fusion restaurant located just a few blocks from the hotel  The restaurant was recommended by the concierge who also made our reservations  The hotel staff were very professional and helpful  Everyone was friendly and perfectly bilingual  We picked up a few basic words of French which seem to have been appreciated  The hotel staff provided culinary recommendations as well as directions around the city  They carefully ked each destination on our map and explained how to use the Metro which was useful  We would never have been able to get home from the FINA opening ceremonies without the subway  Via the Metro it was facile  The hotel is located right next to a famous Montreal church the Notre Dame Basilica  The church was then showing quotSaint Peter and the Vatican The Legacy of the Popesquot a fascinating exhibit of Papal art going back to the very beginnings of the church  Indeed the exhibit was more about the history of the church than the many artistic wonders of the Papacy of which their were many  The hotel is quite new three years old I think although the building might be from an earlier period  The rooms are quite spacious and organized as suites at least ours was  Each of the rooms and the common areas are nicely orated  However I am not the right person to comment on the architectural nuances  However one nice touch was a translucent mirror wall between the bedroom and the bathroom  You couldnt see into the bathroom  However if the bathroom lights were on the bedroom was partially illuminated  Our suite included a queen bed that was very comfortable  During our stay the weather in Montreal was balmy with highs around  Centigrade middles s in Fahrenheit  After a long day walking around Montreal including climbing Mount Royal our room cooled to perfection was a welcome respite  The hotel includes an indooroutdoor restaurant that looked very nice  However we never had an opportunity to try it   Montreal has at least one other entertainment district in addition to Old Montreal  We found a great many nice restaurants around Crescent street located below Mount Royal  This area is a reasonable walk from the hotel although after a full day including Jazz until  AM we did take a cab home  Interestingly enough the Jazz club Upstairs was pointed out to us by the Montreal police who were quite friendly and helpful  My only modest critique of Le Saint Sulpice is that the shower water pressure was somewhat lower than expected  The hotel was perfectly clean although we never saw the stuff who kept it that way  Overall Le Saint Sulpice was a great choice in a city with many hotels  Notably it wasnt particularly expensive in spite of the many amenities and services offered  Highly recommended  
P => Wonderful and Relaxing We spent two days at the hotel  It was very clean and quite modern  The breakfast at the hotel was excellent  We could not have asked for friendlier service anywhere in the hotel from the moment we checked in till we left  It was well within walking distance to everything in quotOld Montrealquot as well as St Cathreines Street for the shopping enthusiast  Many excellent Restaurants eveything within a few minutes  Great location for a getaway  I would definately stay here again Also everyone was very fluent in English  Bonus  
P => If youre looking for a charming hotel this is it My boyfriend and I just returned from a  day visit to Montreal and absolutely loved Le Saint Sulpice Our ision to stay here was mostly based on the positive reviews that were posted on this site and I honestly cant say one bad thing about it well except for the free buffet breakfast included with our room rate  It was mediocre but free so we werent complaining  We arrived around  AM and were greeted with a friendly smile  The air conditioner wasnt working properly in our room so after  attempts to fix the problem we were moved and upgraded the very next day The rooms are very spacious clean and comfortable  We found the staff to be very helpful  We lost our travel book on the flight so we relied heavily on the concierge for dinner suggestions  We can honestly say that every restaurant that was recommended and many that we stumbled across on our own were excellent  The quotokayquot ones were still above average We found the location of the hotel to be perfect  Old Port was a couple blocks away  Place Jacques Cartier is a must see located in the Old Port area  It is mainly a pedestrian street loaded with quaint cafes and restaurants Rue Saint Paul borders the hotel and is also load with fantastic restaurants and coffee shops Chinatown is a couple blocks from the hotel  If you like good chinese food and dont need all the fluff of a fancy place check out Beijing Restaurant  The or is nothing fancy but the food is great Another great area we discovered downtown is The Latin Quarter located off Rue St  Denis  There are a lot of cafes not really fancy restaurants  We stumbled across Rue Prince Arthur a cute cobble stone pedestrian St  which also had outdoor cafes Jazzfest was going on downtown during our stay and was amazing  It was a quick trip via metro or a nice   minute walk from the hotel Downtown is definitely a must see but I definitely recommend staying in Old Montreal  It is a little quieter and more charming than downtown but is still close to the hustle and bustle of the city In closing I definitely recommend Le Saint Sulpice if you are looking for a hotel that is conveniently located quiet charming spacious and comfortable  We will definitely stay there again if we ever return to Montreal 
P => Great Location Great Rooms I recently stayed at Le Saint Sulpice while attending a conference in Montreal  The hotel is perfectly located close to the convention centre Palais de Congress but it is right in Old Montreal as well  I dont think you can find a better location The rooms are large comfortable and well appointed  I read a few reviews on this site criticizing the service but I found the service to be superb  Friendly and efficient  The hotel did make a minor error regarding adjoining rooms but that wasnt a big deal  I also visited a client that had one of the two bedroom suites  The suites are really nice  Big and well orated and it even has a real fireplace  My colleagues in the suite were equally impressed with the hotel  
P => Clean and roomy luxury My wife and I stayed one night at the Saint Sulpice while driving back from our honeymoon in the Eastern Townships of Quebec  We were very happy with our stay  If you like your hotel rooms to be clean and roomy Saint Sulpice is the place for you Every inch of the hotel seems to be immaculately clean   the lobby the corridors and especially the rooms  We had a standard one bedroom suite which was beautifully orated with modern furnishings  The room had one of the largest bathrooms I have ever seen in a hotel room it provided more than enough room for two people to get ready to go out for dinner  Our room also had a very comfortable leather smoking chair that was great for reading The hotel is in a great location in the old port of Montreal it is on the west side of the old port so it is far enough from the really touristy part of the district  Also it is about a five minute walk to the nearest subway station which makes it very convenient for exploring Montreal  The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay  At check in the original room we were assigned to smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was on a non smoking floor we were promptly moved to a new room  We forgot our umbrella and coats in the car valet parking and the bellhop went to retrieve them for us  One should keep in mind that we stayed on a weekday night and the hotel did not seem all that busy All in all my wife and I would definitely go back to the Saint Sulpice  
P => Wonderful Stay We went to the St Sulpice for our anniversary and were met by a very accomodating staff  The suite was beautiful and quite comfortable and clean  The restaurant food was excellent and the waiter very friendly the only rudeness were the other customers at the next table  Went to the spa and dealt with more nice people  Couldnt ask for a better location close to everything but far enough from St  Jaques square to have it quiet as well  Would definately enjoy another stay at the St  Sulpice  
P => Excellent Hotel and Great Location This property located in Old Montreal is definitely far above average  I wasnt certain what to expect but had researched it as much as possible on TripAdvisor before booking a three night stay  Tip book through Bonjour Quebec the official tourist Web site for great rates  The staff was extremely friendly greeting me upon arrival as well as taking care of arranging my shuttle back to the airport at the end of my stay  I was also pleasantly surprised with the certificates I received for free continental breakfast each morning  This is also the first time Ive been provided pre printed business cards by a hotel with my name and hotel contact information in case I need to provide others I meet my details while in town  Not too far away  minute walk is an IGA ket adjacent to a shopping mall and here you can buy light groceries that can be placed in the room refrigerator and cooked in the microwave provided  There is also a very modern stovetop and potspans  One of the best features is definitely the plush spa like bathroom with floating sink basin and the bedroom closes off from the living area with French doors to provide extra privacy  Woud stay again 
P => Stay in style in old Montreal Chosen initially for its central location in the old city Le Saint Sulplice turned out to be excellent in every way  Boutique hotel style savvy but not as painfully hip as the nearby W Hotel and the reassuring cosiness of older European hotels  Large rooms and bathrooms lovely wood fire and deep sofas in lobby  Courteous and reliable staff  Not a budget option however  
P => Choose this one Hotel lovely  Room service expensive for what you get but all else is good value for an above average experience  Gym is well equipped  Staff extremely helpful  Wonderful location  
P => Highly recommend this hotel Great hotel service and location  We had room service for breakfast the first morning since we just couldnt get motivated after the long drive  Food was better than average  They upgraded us to a suite when we checked in and luckily we overlooked the outside dining area  I would recommend upgrading to a suite if you can get a view of the courtyard  Very large living area and the bedroom was okay ample closet space everywhere  We walked around the Old Montreal area for most of our stay there and the hotel is in the best location possible  I would recommend a drink at the Hotel Nelligan which is right around the corner  For dinner I would recommend Modavie again right around the corner from the hotel  We paid about  a night and a comparable room in NYC would have cost at least  night  I will definitely return  Ask the concierge for more dining recommendations  
P => Huge Suite Great Service We arrived at the front door a dark snowy Friday evening ruary th to be met by a very friendly and welcoming doorman a valet arrived immediately to take our bags clear the car of any necessities and whisked us inside to check in  The valet advised us the quotin and out servicequot was free all weekend a parking fee was applicable expected and reasonable The lobby with its sophisticated warmth both in or and personnel is a true expression of the weekend stay that lay before us  Check in was swift and courteous  Before long we were upstairs in a suite that was HUGE tastefully appointed from linens for bed bath and table kitchenware curtains and furnishings  Our bags arrived via bell man shortly thereafter We found an easy to operate electric fireplace a stocked mini bar and basket of snacks we always bring our own a balcony overlooking the winter scaped courtyard garden a terrific bathroom with two entrances a arate shower and double jetted tub and a very cool double sink  Plenty of towels two terry robes even slippers  Everything was just gorgeousThe weekend flew by as we went about our first discovering of Montreal on a very frigid and snowy weekend  But Le Saint Supplice was the perfect retreat from the days activities warm comfortable and inviting  We would stay there again perhaps in summer next time  Highly recommended  
P => Perfect The Le Saint Sulpice was the nicest hotel We stayed in uary and had a great time The hotel is very nice and quaint  Its located in Old Montreal right behind the Notre Dame  The staff is exceptional  They were always very helpful when asking questions  They went above and beyond without us asking for anything  The restaurant in the hotel is exceptional  The complimentary breakfast includes eggs bacon sausage cereal and croissants  More than we expected  The rooms are very large nice and affordable  We went through the Montreal tourism website and received our second night for half off  It was the perfect hotel You wont be disappointed  
P => Wonderful The staff are friendly helpful knowledgeable and courteous    they truly know what customer service means  The location is phenomonal    in the heart of the beautiful old city  The rooms are warm spacious with good amenities    the attention to detail in all aspects are commendable I travel often but usually just stay at the must economic choice  This place was worth splurging on    an amazing weekend  
P => Lovely Hotel My dhter and I stayed at le St Sulpice in old Montreal for a weekend in uary   We loved this boutique hotel  Our room was huge with elegant furnishings and a beautiful bathroom  We had room service for dinner one night and it was prompt and delicious  The breakfast which was included with the room was very nice especially on Sunday morning when there were hot and cold choices  The lobby and public areas were lovely the staff pleasant and helpful   cannot say anthing but good things about this hotel  We enjoyed the location in old Montreal and it was a five minute walk to the subway  
P => Wonderful experience The Le Saint Sulpice certainly does deserve the wonderful reviews that others have given  I booked this hotel for an anniversary with my girlfriend and she LOVED it  She has traveled extensively all over the world and she commented that this was the best hotel she had ever stayed in  We had a deluxe suite with a fireplace which added that extra ambience to make a good experience a great one The location is easy to get to and very convenient to the quaint shops of Old Montreal and the underground malls  The staff is very friendly and willing to help with any needs or questions you  have  The only downside was the breakfast in the morning  While the food was very good the continental breakfast items were often wiped out and not refilled on a timely basis  
P => Love the front desk personnel we enjoyed our stay bec the front desk were very hospitable and that makes a lot for peole who has kids and were not able to read the guidebooks of montreal  the doormen are friendly and very quick to answer questions  they go the extra mile  the room was lovely  i highly recommend this bec people try hard to make your visit great  
P => BEST choice in Montreal My husband and I just returned from an overnighter at Le Saint Sulpice and cannot say enough great things about it  We have already recommended it to all our friends  Our Loft Suite was very spacious immaculate wonderfully orated with European simplicity and taste and made for an awesome stay  The leather loveseat and chair were new and comfortable  The full kitchenette with refrigerator stove and sink was great   we could not remember staying EVER at any hotel that included REAL glasses water cocktail AND wine glasses  What a treat  The queen bed with down comforter was scrumptious  The faux fireplace was a nice touch  The balcony would have been phenom if it had been summer The bathroom was huge with ceramic tile a large soaking tub large tile shower and beautiful glass vanity  The toiletries and robes were also top notch  The staff was incredibly gracious and we felt very pampered and taken care of   from the valet parking to the moment we left  The location is superb right in the heart of old Montreal and walking distance to all the great restaurants and the port  We will not consider staying anywhere else in Montreal and will definitely be back again and again  Perhaps next time we will try massages at the Spa Thanks to all the staff for our wonderful stay   and we cant wait to return 
P => Very happy with Le Saint Sulpice We stayed a night at Le Saint Sulpice and were very happy with the hotel  We found the rooms very comfortable and that the or lived up to the web site images  The staff were friendly and helpful  Terrific location  
P => Le Saint Sulpice was a great stay We stayed at the Le Saint Sulpice for a long weekend the week before Christmas  The hotel was one of the highlights of the trip The room was quite spacious well orated and very clean  The large living room bedroom and bathrooms were all arate giving it a quothomequot feel  We even had a kitchenette  The balcony view of the back of the Notre Dame cathedral was very nice  The location was fine as well we were right in the heart of Old Montreal  The service was great we were expecting a little snotiness because are Americans but there was none of that  The staff was courteous and very helpful  The best part of our stay there was coming home at night and lighting a fire in the fireplace  it was just what we needed after a long day out in the cold  We will definitely stay at the Le Saint Sulpice on our next rip to Montreal  
P => Great location great hotel We just returned from three nights at Le Saint Sulpice  our first time in Montreal in over  years when we did NOT stay at the Queen Elizabeth or Intercontinental  This hotel won us over for all future stays the location in the Old Port is very convenient for all the Old Port shops and restos but only a  min walk up to Rene Levesque or St Catherines for shops there shorter if you follow underground tunnel system  Our room was a large suite on the sixth floor with balcony and fireplace with a very large bathroom  Very convenient was the minikitchen with burners microwave and sink and a fridge with some room left over from minibar stocking that we could use for our own needs  We had breakfast as part of the room rate it is served the restaurant and has not only breads including chocolate ptits pains cheeses and yoghourt but also bacon sausage and eggs scrambled were provided but you can order any other type at no cost  The service was first rate as coffee and juices were topped off many times by hard working waitstaff who also promptly delivered the hardboiled and fried eggs we ordered  The desk staff were very helpful too esp in getting dinner reservations for us on busy nights We looked at some other boutique hotels nearby but found Le Saint Sulpices staff with their dress uniform and demeanor to be more professional and welcoming  Visitors interested in architecture should check out the model of the hotel as it fits into the space behind the Basilica  look for signs to the Business Centre then look to the left as you enter the stairwell  You can also check out how older walls were reused into the hotel by looking around in the stairwell and in the Spa on the fifth floor We will definitely stay here again on future visits  
P => A wee gem Le Saint Sulpice lives discreetly in the old part of Montreal and it is a delightful and comfortable boutique hotel  The rooms especially those that overlook the inner courtyard are very pleasant and are more like ior suites  The staff are incredibly friendly and the location is within walking distance of a whole host of restaurants and bars  The downtown shopping area is a bit of a walk about two miles but it would always be my first choice in Montreal  
P => Wonderful Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Saint Suplice for  nights in early ober   We were delighted to be shown to a handsome suite with two bedrooms two baths cooking facilities and a large living room complete with wood burning fireplace It is a lovely new hotel located conveniently behind Notre Dame Cathedral within close walking distance to everything in the Old Town area  The buffet breakfast in the basement restaurant was included in the price of the room and was great eggs breakfast meats cereal fruit etc  When it is warm weather the hotel has a lovely outdoor tented restaurant off the lobby  The concierge was one of the best we have met  His restaurant recommendations were perfect  What a wonderful hotel 
P => great place My husband and I loved the Saint Sulpice  Old Montreal is the place to stay around if your planning to visit Montreal  Quiet quaint streets with great restaurants around this location  Rooms are very nice and clean with a modern twist  
P => Great location even better service We stayed for two nights    A romantic getaway that turned out to be wonderful thanks to the excellent staff  From the moment the doorman took the car on Friday and brought it back on Sunday everything went splendidly The suite was great with a fireplace arate bedroom and kitchenette great bathroom  The windows in the room were like french doors that opened overlooking the street with a railing so it was like a verhanda  We lit the fireplace opened the windows turned off the lights and let the cool autumn breeze and the sounds of Old Montreal envelop us  Very romanticSpa and health club nice massages great  Dined in the S restaurant food and service was excellent  The breakfast buffet was OK  The location is perfect and we cant wait to go back  
P => Le Saint Suplice Surpassed Our Expectations My boyfriend and just came back from a weekend in Montreal  Anyone looking for a quick romantic getaway who cant afford a trip to Paris should seriously consider Old Montreal and Le Saint Sulpice  Ive stayed at many beautiful  star hotels and Le Saint Sulpice has surpassed them all  The location was excellent  The hotel is about a two minute walk to the port and about a  minute walk to St  Catherine Street and the Underground shopping mall  The small streets and local boutiques were more reminiscent of a quaint European town as opposed to a major Canadian urban centre  The room also surpassed our expectations  The suite had a living room with a fireplace kitchenette arate bedroom and very large bathroom  Everything we needed was already supplied in the room  The or was modern yet very elegant  It felt nothing like a hotel And finally despite some of the reviews Ive read about this hotel I found the staff incredibly courteous and accommodating  They spoke several languages and were always more than happy to suggest a great restaurant or a good place to shop  I couldnt have been happier and will definitely be spreading the word to friends and family and to those reading this review about this hotel 
P => Great hotel great location A great hotel   new beautiful huge rooms at a fair price Good service from young staff Great location   right behind Notre Dame and steps away from the Science Centre  
P => Best Hotel Ive ever been to PERIOD We went to the Canadian GP back in e amp stayed here upon the recommendation of our agent The room is spacious amp clean amp were all suite The weather was gorgeous that we could sleep with the balcony doors opened  The bathroom is a little small by todays luxe hotel standards amp the towels supply were on the skimpy side   but small whines  The staff is top notch FRIENDLY amp HELPFUL   the desk amp concierge service  amp they gave us a great restaurant reservation on short notice no less to goto every night  I had a  star meal every nightOverall I will give keep this hotel on the very top of my destination list esp  when you factor in the exchange rates for AmericansDid I say the staff was friendly 
P => A Wonderful Experience We had the most wonderful experience at Le Saint Sulpice  The room was beautiful  We had a room on the street side but never heard any noise at all and it was wonderful to open the windows and watch the activity on the street when we wanted  All of the staff from check in to check out and after were extremely friendly and helpful  We left a couple of items behind when we checked out  The conceirge located them and mailed them to us at home  Also a food tip for the hotel restaurant the Filet Mignon is excellent  
P => Almost Perfect Spent one pleasant night at the LSS near the end of ust  As the room was not ready at  PM I was given a free upgrade to a nicer suite from the basic  The room was a courtyard view overlooking the outdoor restaurant  It included a serarate bedroom large bathroom with tub and erate shower fake fireplace in the sitting area and sinkmicrowavehot plate kitchen area It was the little touches I appreciated like the safe in the closet and the cool frosted glass between the bathroom sink and the bedroom vanity My only beef was that I had to pay for my breakfast which should have been free  I didnt let it bother me too much By the way eat a nice light meal at the quotSquot and you  have room for two Creme Brule 
P => Very pleasant stay Stayed for two nights at LSS and enjoyed every minute of it  Had a one bedroom suite plus sofabed in living room  Both beds were very comfortable  Loved the or which set it apart from most hotels I stay in  Suite had everything we needed and then some  Didnt eat at hotel since we were never really there at meal time  More than enough restaurant options in Old Montreal anyway  Very handy location for wandering through the old city and returning to hotel for a brief rest before heading out again  Staff was very helpful and friendly including those who helped my niece get her laptop up and running on the internet  Favourite part of staying there was being able to completely open up the large windows in the living room  Felt as though the sights and sounds of the old city came right into the room and definitely made up for lack of a balcony     the entire living room felt like a balcony Definitely a great deal for the super promo rate I was able to reserve  Only thing that kept it from being an excellent stay were a few very minor things I noticed which I hope the hotel begins to address or it will start to go downhill  For example the night lock on the door was very sticky there were slight stains on the upholstery and the duvet cover fabric was pilled all over definitely needed a new cover IMHO  
P => Excellent stay This hotel in one word is excellent Excellent  quality service rooms spa and staff The concierge Patrick is superb  The staff behind the reception desk are superb  The doormen are superb  And so is the maidThere is no pooljacuzzi at this place but rooms have individual large baths and arate showers Location is fantastic  Right around the corner from the Basilica Valet parking for Canadian   night Stay here you will not regret it 
P => Lovely Hotel in Vieux Montreal A wonderful boutique hotel in Vieux Montreal   very charming clean nicely orated large rooms lovely garden restaurant  Definitely THE place to stay in Montreal  
P => Luxury weekend in Old Montreal Although weve been all over the world we have done very little travel in our own country and this year we ided to take a few weekends and do just that  We stayed in the St  Sulpice for  nights and the hotel is very nice ranking with some of the nicer European hotels we have stayed in  This is an all suite hotel and the rooms are huge and include a bed a hide a bed a fridgeminibar microwave stove and  TVs  There is also ample room for a cot if you are travelling with a large family  Id agree with one of the other reviews that the beds could be a bit more comfortable but we didnt find the bed so hard that we couldnt sleep or anything The location of the St  Sulpice is ideal   just down the hill from the Notre Dame cathedral and  block from the waterfront you are in the heart of Old Montreal but still in a quiet area The breakfast that was included in our package was not great but again is on par with what you would find in continental Europe dont write off the hotel restaurant based on that though  We had dinner there one night and it was outstanding the desert especially was I think the best I have ever had  There are also literally dozens of restaurants within walking distance to sample   you could stay there for a week and never eat at the same place twice  Highlights were the Jardin Nelson on Place Jaques Cartier for some good lunch hour people watching and excellent sangria and the crepe tent set up down by the water Montreal itself is great   there are a ton of things to do and see at any time and y seems to be festival month  On Saturday alone we took in the Jazz Festival a Caribbean festival and an international fireworks competition and the previous  days were ked by Canada Day celebrations  Wed like to return for the comedy festival next year but in any event will be returning and staying at the St  Sulpice  
P => good for jetlag I went from united arab emirates for a business trip and stay at the St Sulpice Hotel in the Old Port of Montreal  The first time I get there I was completely Exhausted Jetlag Punched and my back was killing me  The front desk girl really friendly and smilly suggested me to get a massage in my room  My massage therapist saved my life with her special oil and her magical touch Bravo I was totally impressed with all the customer service in the Hotel and services around  I will for sure recommend you this Hotel in this aera and of course a massage 
P => No is not an option    I was recently a guest in this wonderful boutique hotel and trust me its not going to be the last time  From pulling up to the drive way to checking out after  memorable nights everyhting was flawless The rooms are generous in size well equiped and comfortable  The restaurant has a great menu and the wait staff are very courteous Vincent and Nicolas if I remember right     The gym is fair in size but has all the equipment needed for a good workout  The spa manager Dan seems like a know it all and was advising me to try other machines nice of him but Ive been doing my routine for  years and its working out fine  The front of the house staff the most incredible team of bellmen Rafal Dave Alex and co you could ever be served by polite courteous and always smily  The reception staff should all get a raise for being so helpful and efficient  If I had to pinpoint the most outstanding part of my stay It would have to be the concierge  This young asian man Patrick gave my wife and I the most incredible service we could ever get  We had been paused for our weekend with losing a piece of our luggages from the airline with one phone call he got it delivered  hours after we shared the story with him  He made all the arrangements for our lunches and dinners wonderful suggestions always right on track and found us tickets to a sold out Opera show at cost price without going through the broker  He kept on saying that the creed of the hotel tht by the General Manager was NO IS NOT AN OPTION I will surely recommend this hotel to many of our friends  Keep up the good work St Sulpice 
P => Beautiful Hotel   except for Spa Hotel was beautiful and spacious for Old Montreal  Staff were very friendly and helpful  Room was very large and tastefully designed  Our breakfast was buffet style and a great selection  I believe that you can get an quota la cartequot menu if you like  The only main problem we had was with the spa or lack of one  We tried to book a massage for one of the  days we were there but nobody was available  Also my wife wanted a facial but nobody worked the weekend  Also apparently there was an electrical problem and we could not use any of the other spa faciltiies for the entire weekend  Otherwise I would highly recommend  
P => Dont stay anywhere else  This hotel equals or surpasses some of the best boutique hotels Ive stayed in Campton Place in San Francisco Inn of the Anasazi in Santa Fe Hotel aland in the Yucatan etc  The suites are big and luxurious  Its hard to imagine how the staff could be more friendly and theres no bowing and scraping which I guess some people like  At first I was worried about the location because of its distance from Downtown but that was not an issue Old Montreal is one of the more interesting parts of the city now and Downtown is walking distance during the day and a cheap cab ride or chepaer subway ride at night  Unlike the other traveler I was bowled over by the breakfast buffet  My ONLY complaints are There were two niches in the walls that were missing their sculptureshelveswhatever belonged there and the massage therapist was mediocre  The hotel is not expensive so I definitely will be back  
P => would return great place terrific customer service  by the way my girlfriend felt hotel is very romantic  we had room with fireplace  also we both enjoyed the continental breakfast when you arrive you also get coupons for a free cocktail or glass of wine from bar restaurant is nice rooms attractive and clean very attentive service great location  lots of very good places to eat within walking distance  all in all highly recommended  looking forward to going back 
P => would love to go back very attractive hotel  great customer service nice rooms nice restaurant good location  went for a few nights withj my girlfriend  she and i both found it very romantic  had romm with fireplacehad requested this but when i arrived they told me none left after a few phone calls made by the bell hop knowing i was very unhappy we had our fireplace  by the way they cant guarantee a fireplace will be available when you arrive even if you book one  cant figure that one out  nevertheless a really nice comfortable place with people that do their best to make sure your stay is a pleasant one  i would return

P => We loved it After reading the reviews I had high expectations for the hotel and it lived up to them and more  My kids  and  upon arrival were immediately charmed by the bellhop guys who high fived my youngest and talked hockey with my oldest  Really nice to take time like that for little guys  The room was huge and really comfy  A bit too much so since my husband and I had a hard time getting them outside to see the city  They wanted to go swimming and watch the flat screen tv instead  The pool was really nice for them and a great vista  However its much more of a lap pool  The parking was also convenient  There is a lot right next door and I think it is a bit cheaper  However its an outdoor lot and Im fairly sure there rate of  CAD was not for  hours like the hotel  Overall I thought the valet parking charge of  CAD was worth it  Overall the only complaint I heard from our ranks was my husband who claimed the mattress was hard  I however loved it since I like firmer mattresses  Also map quest the hotel before you set out for it  The directions included on their website are really really poor  Luckily we had our iphones and a basic understanding of the Montreal streets or we would have been horribly lost  Anyways I highly recommend the hotel and cant wait to go back  Super friendly staff 
P => Lovely place great location helpful staff would stay here again Lovely place great location  Can easily get to the  sights   Old Town is within walking distance as is Mount Royal if you don t mind walking up hill all the way  Metro station is about  minutes walk so can get to Olympic Park and Botanical Gardens very easily Staff were very helpful  I don t speak French but that wasn t a problem as they were happy to converse in English The Italian restaurant next door was really nice and very reasonable in price If in Montreal again will definitely stay there again If you are in Montreal go to the Old Town and get on the Jet Boat ride up the St Lawrence rapids it is a real blast  You will get wet so if you do ide to do this rather than a spur of the moment thing then I would suggest you wear your speedoscostume and take underwear and a towel to change into after the trip  Woolly jumpers over suits and lifejackets are provided they are not designed to keep you dry  
P => Unique hotel with a great location My husband and I traveled here as the second part of our honeymoon trip in Canada  I had never been to Montreal before so it was a bit hard for me to find although that just might be my lack of city driving skills    However once we found it we were very pleased This hotel is located right in the middle of the city adjacent to Rue St  Catherine The hotel does charge   a day for valet parking but its an amenity we didnt mind paying for  The conciergevalet service was extremely helpful and even offered to retrieve umbrellas from our car for us on a rainy day The staff was extremely pleasant and courteous  Because we were on our honeymoon we were informed that we had been upgraded to a larger room when we checked in  When we entered the room we were totally blown away  This room was so huge we didnt know what to do with ourselves The pictures online do it no justice as our ceilings were easily  ft  tall with a arate bedroom area living area and kitchen area  It was nicely neat and clean We were located in the middle of downtown where everything was just a walk away  Old Montreal was about a  minute walk but this city is really pedestrian friendly  The concierge was really helpful with suggestions for dining out and recommended some wonderful restaurants  There was complementary continental breakfast served each morning and a small restaurant attached to the hotel  We didnt eat there but we wish we had as it looked good  The best part of the hotel is the roof k with its amazing view of the city  There are lounge chairs and an indoor swimming pool on the roof  The scenery is incredible in that part of the hotel and we were frequent visitors In all we had a very positive experience here  It was a very classic hotel with many strong points  We certainly recommend it to others 
P => great location in addition to a charming little italian restaurant this really made our trip pleasurable and comfortable the hotels cleanliness and spacious rooms in addition to the very professional staff are only outshone by the good location in downtown Montreal as well as the lovely Italian restaurant where we took our lunch and cappucino  great value for money  
P => Best hotel of our entire trip We stayed in Montreal for  nights as part of a  week Canada and USA trip  This hotel was a highlight   well located within easy walking distance of the train station and the main shopping strip yet in a quiet and safe neighbourhood  The room was huge with a full kitchendishwasher and dining table and the king sized bed was amazingly comfortable  The hotel has a guest laundry and indoor pool on the top floor and a no charge business centre for internetcomputer access  Everything that a traveller needs  Reception staff were efficient and professional and there was no issue with us conversing in English  The only suggestion that I would make to the hotel is to improve the information contained within the guest services directory   there was no mention of the guest laundry which we found quite by accident as we were exploring the pool area  
P => We were very pleased We spent  nights at Le Square Phillips and were very pleased with our choice  We booked a standard king suite through hotels com for approximately night  Given the location in a major metropolitan city we felt we received an excellent value  As others have written the rooms are huge  Spacious living area with very tall ceilings a table with  chairs a fully functional kitchen with full size refrigerator and oven  The bathroom was adequate if on the older side  The bed was fine but firm which we like but beware if firm mattresses dont agree with you  The bedding could have been of higher quality you could nearly see through the sheets  Quiet stay and no issues with maid service The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast which is on par with most complimentary hotel breakfasts  Plenty of cereal and pastry selections fruit yogurt juice amp coffee We loved the size of the room and the location in Montreal  We walked everywhere or took the Metro  Would definitely stay here again if we return  
P => Rare combo of chic and friendly We chose this hotel based on other tripadvisor reviews and were glad we did  It was a rare combo of chic and friendly  My husband and I loved the urban vibe and the kids loved the room the pool and the breakfast  The hotel is well located with friendly and helpful staff  A few caveats for families with young kids though  The pool is m deep from end to end   too deep for kids to stand  Great looking flat screen tvs in rooms had limited kid friendly channels especially in English  Minor points really in an otherwise great stay  
P => Excellent Hotel Le Square Phillips is an excellent hotel  The location is ideal it is centrally located and near several Metro stops  Our room was great the kitchen was well equipped the view was nice and the unique architecture of building really stood out in the room design  I would recommend the hotel to families and couples alike  The free internet access on hotel computers and breakfast were added bonuses that a lot of up scale hotels dont include in their offers  
P => Great location Stayed for  nights in a double studio room  Hotel is just minutes from busy Rue Catherine but very quiet  Additionally the hotel is also a short walk to Chinatown Old Montreal and Metro lines  The room was just as the picture showed on their web page and had a spacious area where the dining tablekitchen was located  The bathroom was large and very clean The continental breakfast options included in the hotel rate were okay but we chose to buy a selection of items at the kets see my reviews of the Jean Talon and Atwater kets on a couple of the days instead of the hotel provided breakfast  Would definitely stay here again  
P => Nice Hotel Located downtown about a  minute walk to Old Town but close to many other attractions this is a smaller hotel with really big comfortable rooms  Valet parking is  a day  Staff was cordial and helpful  Continental breakfast was included but that is my only minor complaint  Very basic Motel  type spread  
P => Large and comfortable bed A great hotel large and comfortable bed large and quiet room very convenient location  
P => worst hotel experience in  years most overrated hotel  made a reservation based on trip advisor rating bnut TA way off on this one  arrogant check in staff cold impersonal room internet connection terrible coffee and breakfast must be avoided  Room was large but so what  i had to empty the dishwasher when i checked in to get a cup for coffee  The gym is useless  Montreal is a great city  this hotel is like a plain vanilla hotel in any city  no feeling at all that one is in such a great city I would never stay here again  do yourself a favor and find another hotel to stay in Montreal 
P => Good Value Stayed here for two nights on a Friday and Saturday in late ust as part of a trip to Montreal amp Quebec City  Great Value  Good location easy in easy out with Valet Parking  Its within walking distance of shopping old Montreal amp Chinatown although a bit far for the later two We had a large roon with a full kitchen complete with refrigerator microwave table plates and utensils  Breakfast was included but is limited but adequatecereal bagels peanut butter bread muffins and fruit Would certainly recommned for families and for longer satys  
P => Wonderful location and lots nearby I stayed for three nights and it was wonderful Check in was quick and the staff friendly  Concierge answered my questions and mapped out wherehow to get to places  Valet parking was easy  Location is great  You are   blocks from Ste Catherines Street which is very active with lots of restaurants shops and people  I felt fine to walk around alone  You are also within blocks of many churches and museums  Leave your car with the valet and use subway and buses  The system was easy to get around  Breakfast at the hotel was fine   mostly breads fruit cereal and juice   enough for me  My room was quite large and when I asked apparently I had a smaller room  It had  beds a full kitchen and a large bathroom  Very clean  I would definitely plan to stay there again  
P => Great for teens Great location  Big rooms which our two teenagers liked  Excellent service and very secure  Two Internet terminals in business centre at lobby level  Breakfast could be better if there were more choices  Small gym and beautiful swimming pool on top level  Also a nice k on roof  Central to downtown Montreal  Beds are very firm but we were ok with them  Would definitely go back  
P => Great set up all around We spent four nights in a two bedroom suite   incredibly spacious  The hotel is very centrally located so you can walk in many different directions  The included breakfast is very simple but it is quick and easy and filling  It is very nice not to have to look for another restaurant for a meal The pool is small but very nice with a nice roof top k The hotel is very quiet  I was always surprised at how many people were in the breakfast room given that we didnt hear or see them at any other time of day We will definitely go back to this hotel 
P => Lovely   Perfect for our little family  Most have already covered what we would say  It would be nice to see a bit more variety in the breakfast but that is our only small quibble  It is so comfortable and the service was fabulous  they were lovely and classy and not at all pretentious  The pizza place a few doors down had good thin crust pizza  you can take it back to your room or eat on the patio area there so its really convenient  The hotel downstairs was nice but a bit priciernicer than necessary for a family with an impatient small child  They were very accommodating but it was kinda wasted on her  year old sensibilities  
P => Best hotel on the planet HUGE HUGE room with FULL FRIDGE MicroWave  burner stove and  EVERYTHING  very reasonable prices for Montreal totally awesome staffThey are large enuf to be very professionalandThey are SMALL enuf to be very PERSONAL and to remember you your car etc  etc Great view from the th floor pool balconyVery close to underground shopping     everything you could want is in walking distance blocks to IGA  blocks to Palace de Congress      or  or  blocks to  AWESOME  food     Easy walk to quotOld Townquot where the hotel prices are  x to x more Parking is  INDOOR  and the ValetConcierge is  VERY   FAST  
P => Excellent service and amenities I stayed at the Square Philips for four nights at the end of y   We booked ior suite  This hotel does live up with the standard described on tripavisor  service was excellent as we checked in one the receptionist who was on its way to leave work came back checked us in  The attention was really eciated  the rooms are nice very quiet with a ent bathroom good choice of TV channels  Concerige and other staffs were truly helpfull during our stay  On the less postive side is the breakfast which is not worth the trip in my opnion although is free  But all in all this hotel has allowed us a very enjoyable time in Montreal  
P => Perfect for our purposes My husband and I traveled to Montreal for our anniversary and wanted to be in a fairly central location with access to public transportation  We found the Le Square Phillips to be excellent for our purposes  We also enjoyed our late afternoon time on the rooftop k to relax with some wine  The rooms were spacious and clean with a kitchen  The breakfasts were adequate  Although we werent able to get much direction from the concierge we had done homework before hand so it wasnt a big deal  If you are looking for extreme luxury the Le Square Phillips is probably not for you  However if you are looking for comfortable centrally located with access to public transportation and an inviting spot to watch the city go by this is the place  We would definitely stay again  
P => Excellent location perfect for a short or in my case  week stay This hotel is right in the middle of downtown montreal  It is very close to loads of restaurants st Catherine st full of shopping and walking distance to the port old montreal mont royal latin quarter etc  It is also a very short walk to the metro to go to other places  The hotel staff are helpful but not obstrusive which is what I like so perfect for our family  The rooms are huge and come with a fully equipped kitchen massive bathroom by hotel standards and daily room service  Valet parking is also available  Concierges are very helpful if you ask and there is a great Italian restaurant colocated but not part of the hotel  The rates are very good for such a location and size of room  There is a small but adequately equipped gym infact in  weeks not once did we have to wait to use the equipment  There is a coin operated laundry and roof top pool and terrace  Continental breakfast is included and while adequate choice is provided the room set up is not ideal we avoided the place on the weekends as it was very crowded during the week is fine but you have a tray in your room and can go grab what you want and then toast away in your room  There is free wireless internet also which we took advantage of and a business centre where you can print if you need too  Given we were there in the summer we could hear the music festivals jazz and francofolies from the roof top or walk easily to the shows  All up we recommend this place for short or long stay and especially for families  
P => Perfect again Arrived late and no problem  Staff friendly as usual  Got great opinions on places to visit  Never a miss with this hotel  The studio room was so large we had no complaints  Every appliance is so clean it is just a nice feeling to be in a clean atmosphere away from home  All in all you cant want more for your money  Again the complimentary breakfast was a very nice touch  Right downtown in the mix  The Bay is at the end of the block for great shopping  Movie house about five minutes away and the amtrak station is within a fifteen min walking distance  Let this hotel be your base for a pleasant stay in Montreal  
P => Good for Short Stay Fantastic for a Long One I spent a month on business in the Square Phillips along with my wife  We had a ior suite which was to put it mildly spacious  The kitchen was well equipped with real appliances the bathroom was huge and the other spaces were well roomy  There is closet space galore  Very comfy for a long stay  The location is central  It is a short walk to the Central RR Station and very close to the Metro and the underground city important in Winter  Many major Montreal corporate HQs and business locations are within a short walk  Breakfast is included although it is a somewhat minimal continental toast croissants bagels with cereal and yogurt and fruit  Nonetheless the items available were good  We supplemented with our own berries and other things bought in a nearby superket  Many restaurants serving a full breakfast are nearby  There is an Italian restaurant in the building not really part of the hotel although you can order room service  It was good although we found it a tad pricey  There are many many other restaurants of all types in the immediate neighborhood  High speed Internet is available via a hard wired plug and Wifi  It works well although it slows down noticeably in the evening when many other users are on  The staff were great cooperative and helpful  The only negative   the windows dont open No problem most of the year but a bit frustrating on a nice spring day  
P => Wonderful We stayed in a studio suite for two nights and were very impressed With active   and   year old boys in tow we needed a spacious room with a full kitchen  and Le Square Phillips delivered As the hotel was converted from a warehouse in  the rooms are very big with the celing about  feet high  KitchenThe kitchen had all major appliances including dishwasher plus toaster and kettle  All crockery dishes and utensils were also there  There was also a drying rack for hand washed items  The kitchen was so well stocked that we were able to prepare our dinners both nights  There was a circular table with four chairs BathroomSpacious and fairly clean  lots of counter space  The water pressure of the shower is a bit high though  The toiletries arent very good either RoomVery clean spacious with lots of closets and shelving  LCD TV with a one seater and ottoman and a desk and chair  Trendy furniture  The two mattresses were firm as others mentioned but we loved them  The pillows were awful though propping two together made it almost tolerable  We were surprised to find that there were no blankets under the sheets  But a call to the service desk fixed the problem right away  Free internet access but no in room safe  There is a safety deposit box at the front desk which we did not use LocationSuper A five minute walk to the Eatons Centre mall and Chinatown and about a  minute walk to Old Montreal AmenitiesThere is a roof top pool and fitness centre with a terrace overlooking the area  Beautiful  The pool was narrow and only four feet deep but the kids had a lot of fun with their PFDs on  There is a free continental breakfast fruits muffins breads cereals etc  that was adequate  Valet parking is day  We never asked for the car until departure so I dont know how easydifficult it wouldve been to access it had we left something inside  But we had no problems getting it upon checking out All in all this was an awesome place  With a government rate it was really worth it Will definitely return  
P => Lovely hotel overpriced make sure it is right location for your visit  Without doubt this is a lovely hotel very modern chic and twenty first century  The room is HUGE this is the only time I might complain about the room being too big  In my opinion the hotel is overpriced at approximately  US per night  If your aim is to be near the St  Catherine Street shopping area the location is perfect  If however you desire to be spend your time in Old Montreal near the docks or at Cirque de Soleil it is quite a hike from Le Square Phillips Hotel  Concierge service lackluster  For our purposes our stay in the Holiday Inn Express in Chinatown was far better  The property does not meet the standard of Le Square Phillip but the location is great a couple of blocks from Notre Dame Basilica and forty percent cheaper  
P => Nothing Special Stayed  nights in y   Good location right in downtown and convenient to old town and china town  The rooms were clean and adequate although not spectacular  Having a kitchen is nice and theres a grocery store  blocks from hotel  The hotel has a clinical feel to it however its not warm nor inviting Some of the staff were really friendly others were actually rude  Parking is always a hassle and except late at night theres always a line of double parked cars in front of the place  I wont return my feeling is that for the money there must be better places to stay in Montreal and I cant imagine how it gets such a high rating on here  Also the pool is really just a lap pool  feet deep at all places and perhaps  X  in area  
P => Good value   huge rooms The other reviews are accurate    what can we add really huge rooms huge bathroom excellent service staff and friendly and very knowledgeable about Montreal  The breakfasts are substantial   but nothing fancy  Overall the place is really quite a value    and all in downtown Montreal  blocks from the Metro  Sq  Phillips is a  min walk from old Montreal and only a block fro a huge shopping centre  
P => Great location clean large rooms The location of this hotel is excellent   within walking distance of downtown Vieux Montreal and Mont Royal  We did not use our car during our stay however note that if you valet park your car at the hotel you cannot easily gain access to it to retrieve any items you  have forgotten to take out upon arrival  The studio room with two double beds and kitchenette was large and the high ceilings made it feel very spacious  The room was clean the beds were firm and comfortable  The breakfast included cereals breads bagels fruit and juices  The rooftop pool clean but small and k offers a nice view of the city  Also we had an excellent meal at a restaurant down the street   Le Grand Comptoir  
P => As good as I expected Traveled with a friend and we had a good time staying in that hotel  Very nice and friendly staff  Only problem was a group of noisy and drunk american teens in our floor  
P => Great hotel perfect location excellent for families We stayed  nights in early y and thoroughly enjoyed it  We totally agree with all the good points of all the other reviews the staff is friendly and helpful the hotel is modern looking clean with nice high ceilings  We had a studio with  double beds and while probably not as big as other suites still felt roomy with the high ceilings  We liked the firm mattresses did not find them too hard  The pool is clean and well maintained only it  be a bit deep for younger children as it is  m all around my dhter had a pfd and thoroughly enjoyed the pool  The location is very convenient  minute walk in opposite directions to  subway stations  We bought a  day tourist pass which was very useful for getting around  For basic groceries eg milk water etc there is a Pharmix on St Catherine street nearby The underground mall is very close as well We found the valet parking good at first we parked at the open parking next door then parked at the hotel  They were very quick in getting our car the parking is indoor and secure if you do not plan to use your car often then I recommend using the valet parking The kitchen was very well equipped we made use of most of the items preparing a simple meal with take out items All in all it was a very comfortable stay very good value and would definitely choose Le Square Phillips again  
P => Fanastic Stay at Square Phillips Hotel I went to Montreal for a  day trip in early y  and stayed for  nights  I choose Le Square Phillips Hotel based on the fanastic reviews online and was definately not disappointed  It was a great hotel and would totally recommend it  The hotel is located just off St  Catherines street but just far away that it isnt too noisy  It is a  minute walk to the train station and located between  subway stations McGill and Square Victoria  There were people on the street all the time so I felt safe walking around at night which is a big plus as I was a solo female traveller in my early s  There is also a drug store within walking distance and many resturants  The Eaton Centre was about a   minute walk away  Old Montreal was a longer walk away  minutes but managable and if you hop on the subway at Square Victoria it is only  stops away  I had a deluxe king studio room and it was HUGE There was a king size bed large flat screen TV a full kitchen fridge dishes dishwasher and sink and big bathroom  There was piles of space and would be really good for families  There were large windows and the room had cool archiectural details  Yes the beds were firm as the other reviews mentioned but it was managable  There was a free breakfast on the second floor every day and it was very good  They had toast cereal english muffins muffins croissants fruit juice and coffee  If you want a hot breakfast then this isnt the place  But it had all the basics and was a good way to start the day  My only complaint and it was so minor was that the staff was a little too efficient and often cleared your plates if you went up for a second cup of coffee or juice  But again very minor issue  The people at the concierge desk were fanastic I asked them lots of questions every morning about where to go and how to get there and they were always very helpful  Their recommendations were great and they patiently explained how best to get from place to place  There is a indoor pool fitness centre and patio on the top floor  I visited the patio several times and it was very relaxing to sit there at the end of the day watching the sunset  Im not sure when it opens but it stays open until   I would definately recommend Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites to fellow travellers in particular families  My stay there was fanastic and would go back again without hesitation  
P => Great Hotel for families We were at Le Square Phillips the second week of e  Everything we read about it is true  It is a great hotel for families  The beds are a little firm but we got used to it  The rooms are HUGE the bathroom is large the kitchen is great  The breakfast is basic but good  Bagels croissants toast yogurt fruit  If you want eggs and meat you will not be happy  However there is a Tim Hortons across the street  Definitely try IL Focolaio about two doors down they make  kinds of pizza and the staff are very nice Also next to them is Amirs a Lebanese restaurant I believe they are a chain but very good food also  The laundry room is wonderful the machines cost  each  to wash  to dry and take loonies only  You can buy a small box of detergent at the front desk for one dollar  The pool is small but our two children were happy  The location is good walking distance to Old Montreal a long walk though for young children  Also a special thanks to Antonin the best concierge in the world  He was very patient with us and our children  Over all we were very very happy with our stay  We were sorry to leave and will definitely be back  
P => A very comfortable and friendly hotel It was great because they were able to accommodate  adults  kids and  baby in a  bedroom suite at a fairly reasonable price  Our kids enjoyed the pool and were very comfortable in our spacious room  I thought the beds were very comfortable the staff were very friendly and the location was great  
P => Comfortable and roomy Would second all positive comments made and our stay was very pleasant Just some small areas for improvement we stayed with  adults  one child in quotquot bedroom suite   bed room has door but nd bed room is half open to living a privacy screen would be useful  Also an extra comfy TV chair would be useful only  couch   chair provided  
P => Great hotel felt like home Myself my wife and our  month old son just stayed  nights  days at this hotel  We enjoyed our stay  The suite was like living in an apartment  The bedroom had lots of space enough for the travel playpen we brought for our baby  Lots of room and the comforts of home  The kitchen was was equiped enough for a short stay  Maid service was thorough and good   they even did our dishes while we were out There were only two negatives in my opinion  There is valet parking so better make sure you take everything you need from the car  Although you can call for your car anytime there is still some inconvenience  I  be biased as I dont like valet parking The second negative was the Italian restautant next door that provides the room service  The food was good but truly over priced  There are lots of other restaurants nearby or buy food and keep in the fridge Other than that we enjoyed our stay at this centrally located hotel  
P => Just an average hotel we went to montreal for  days and stayed at this hotel  this hotel is in the down town and is near the main attractions of the city  the plus point is that the coffee and breakfast is complementary  the rooms are priced high  internet is really fast  but still i think you can get better deal at the same price  The indoor swimming pool is good and is heated  
P => What a pleasure We stayed at Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites for  nights in ch  Our suite was spotless and spacious with a sensible design for a couple with a baby as there is a partition between the bedroom and living area if you need to put a babys crib there  The lounge area is roomy and there is plenty of cupboard space too  The rooms are very quiet and we did not hear any noise from neighbours or hotel staff  The Italian restaurant downstairs is fantastico so you can easily order take aways from them and they deliver to your room  We found this very useful with a sleeping baby after a tiring day  The hotel is centrally located too  Breakfast is basic but adequate  Excellent value and ideal for families with young ones or kids  
P => This hotel is over rated We were on our honeymoon in Canada and our last stop was Montreal  I had read all the great reviews for this hotel on trip advisor and ided to book our  last nights in Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites  The location is good as its near the shopping district and you can also walk to Mount Royal and old Montreal but other than that it is pretty basic  We were told when we checked in that breakfast was complimentary but when we went for breakfast the next morning we were disappointed  The expression you dont get any for free is true unless you like bruised fruit and stale croissants give this a miss  Also we stayed in  hotels on our honeymoon and this was the only hotel that didnt offer us a room upgrade or a small gift so again we were disappointed with the service  Montreal is an interesting city and if you are planning a trip do not miss cirque du soleil the show we went to see was out of this world but find a better hotel 
P => Well appointed and good value Took a long weekend trip to Montreal  Taking advantage of the weaker Canadian dollar and the warmer weather months was a definate plus  We took an outting there for the beer festival going on and this hotel seemed adequate for our larger group and based on past feedback on this site I took the plunge  We got a family suite which was basically a  bed setup with one bedroom closed off and the other in a studio style with a partition arating it from the kitchen The room was pretty large and there was ample seating and room  The view if you want to call it that  Was of a parking lot  On the otherhand the room did have ample sunlight  We had minor issues connecting an xbox to the TV it had the ports conveniently handy but it wasnt working and took some calls to get it going Didnt have food service and we accidentally broke a glass but we werent hassled for it which was a relief  There is a small indoor pool and balcony on the top floor and it was pretty relaxing way to unwind and get some air  It was an enjoyable stay and the location was good with the mall a block away and the downtown area just around the corner  
P => We love this hotel This hotel might not be for everyone but if you enjoy a large quiet room in the middle of a busy city and enjoy eating your meals in restaurants and not in a hotel this might be for you  It is also a good value  
P => No Wow Factor Given the outstanding grading by most reviewers we were expecting something spectacular First off  it gets  out of  so it is pretty good The hotel is in downtown Montreal in an average street the Hotel front is far from Grande or welcoming  When you arrive you have to hand the car over for valet parking which means you feel as though you can t forget anything in it The reception area is rather narrow and the lobby plain and rather  star The staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming The rooms as you will read elsewhere are large and reasonably well appointed we were upgraded as they could not put us next to our friends as requested The pool is small but up on the top floor next to a somewhat sparse gym Breakfast was a disappointment  The cold buffet was OK but despite large bedrooms the dinning room is cramped and somewhat like a cafeteria Overall rooms are pretty good location OK and staff excellent  The hotel is lacking in style but good for a business or weekend trip For a romantic break I d go for the  Auberge du Vieux Port   
P => Great Location This hotel was excellent I didnt realize how close it was to everything when we booked  It was about a  minute walk to Old Montreal and to the bars along St  Catherine  The Underground city was about a  minute walk and  subway stations were about  minutes away also  The rooms were great very big and very clean  Great water pressure from the shower  Didnt see the pool and only woke up early enough for breakfast once  Would highly recommend it to anyone Side note if going to Montreal for the first time I highly recommend the walking tour of old Montreal very informative 
P => Great place to stay in Montreal Trip Advisor does it again We use Trip Advisor before booking all our hotel rooms and the reviews for this hotel were very good  We were not disappointed by the Square Phillips We booked the family suite for our family of three dhter is  months and it was great  The room was absolutely huge and had virtually two bedrooms so we could put baby to sleep in her own room and still stay up to watch tv chat etc  The hotel isnt fancy but the or and well appointed kitchen served all of our needs perfectly  The location is great about a  minute walk to Old Montreal and a nice walk to get there  The continental breakfast being included is a nice bonus too  The only negatives I have are  the concierges were not very good   the   times we dealt with them they didnt seem to know much nor were they particularly helpful e g  we asked where to find a neighborhood restaurant where wed be comfortable bringing our little dhter and the area he suggested was shops upon shops and a BAR  no restaurants  And  the pool is darn chilly so be prepared Overall a fantastic hotel experience would stay there again 
P => Very nice hotel and great location I was staying at this hotel for business for three days and it was a very enjoyable stay  The room was very nice amp clean  The service was great as well  The location couldnt have been better I was five minutes away walking from my office and after I was done everything was so close by it was easy for me to get around  I would def stay at this hotel again  
P => Nice big rooms good breakfast and nice pool Stayed with my partner and  yr old dhter nice large room with kitchen facilities which is great if you have a young child  Also was able to hire a cot for free and high chairs provided The breakfast was great plenty of choice nice and tastey  Staff were very friendly and helpful  Good location everything walkable and very near the metro Also computers for use which is very helpful  
P => Excellent location excellent room excellent staff We stayed at the Le Square Phillips over the long weekend     on the recommendation of other Trip Advisor members and had a great experience overall The location of the hotel is perfect  It is right in the middle of downtown less than a block south of St  Catherines Sreet and all the shopping it offers  It is also only a  minutes walk to Old Montreal which is where we like to be when in Monteal The hotel itself is modest  A small reception area a small sitting area no bar  However considering the location there are plenty of bars and restaurants in teh area so I guess you dont really need that inside the hotel The room that we booked was a studio king  The room was big with a sitting area and a kitchenette  The bathroom was relatively small and the bath tub not very functional but the rest of the room made up for that  The hotel towels were nice and soft and the robe comfy  The kitchen was fully stocked in case you wanted to use it which we didnt  The room had free internet which was great since I had to get some work done over the weekend  The hotel advertises that breakfast is included  Based on our previous experience we assumed that since the website did not advertise that the breakfast was continental breakfast that it would be a full buffet breakfast  However the breakfast was continental breakfast and a little disappointing if you are not a carbs fan which I am but my husband is not  Breakfast included montreal bagels bread muffins fruit cereal juice and coffee  We had breakfast at the hotel the first morning but went out for breakfast the next  mornings  The service at the hotel is magnificent  We asked for recommendations for restaurants for dinner on two occassions and both times the reception staff sent out to fabulous restaurants that we very much enjoyed  The staff responded to every request quickly ie more towels which were sent up in less than  minutes and over all were very keen on good customer service  We recommend this hotel to anyone who is staying in Monteal and wants a central location good customer service and doesnt care about hotel amenities ie bar breakfast etc  
P => best hotel for price We love this hotel  It is located right downtown in the shopping district just off to the side so not too loud at night  The rooms are huge with high ceilings and windows  The room had a kitchen so you can bring food do some cooking if you like  The room was very clean and the bed comfortable  We had plasmalcd tv  Service was very quick and attentive  Breakfast was included and had bagels croissants muffins with coffees juices  Weve stayed in many hotels in Montreal some more expensive but for the price you cannot beat this hotel  Highly recommended 
P => Great Place Check inFriendly easy and smooth  The lobby is very nice and valet parking is available for  dollars CDN per night  RoomClean and well equipped  The bed was comfortable the air conditioning worked well and you could not hear noise in the hallways AmenitiesA pool roof top patio on site restaurant concierge valet parking maid service buffet breakfast free internet as well as fully equipped kitchen make this hotel a memorable experience LocationCant get better ServiceFriendly OverallA great experience 
P => Excellent Value for Money This is an excellent hotel for holiday makers as well as business clients The rooms are nice and spacy  There is internet connection in the room so all you do is plug in  You can cook if you so desire and some basisc cooking utensils are provided in room  The breakfast was a new experience as it was a really good spread  The hotel staff were all very friendly and ready to help The hotel is also centrally located and the shopping areas are right there There are different restaurants all over the place so meals was never any issue and if you dont want to move out the hotel has its own restaurant This was one of the best places weve stayed 
P => just amazing I took a suite   wow it was hige and clean we had a arate bedroom   full kitchenette and living room two flat screen tvs one in the bedroom and one in the living room   very spacious with huge ceilings   absolutely perfect the breakfast is included   it is a area that is just like a restaurant and it is a self serve all you can eat breakfast with all the essentials staff was very pleasant   t is close to everything   I will definitely go back and soon 
P => Great location Downton Montreal Central location  Great suites for a family and a nice pool on the th floor  
P => Very Nice Room Great Value My wife and I stayed herre with our  year old dhter for  nights in early il  We loved the room  Very spacious with high ceilings and a kitchenette  The roof top pool was small but we still enjoyed a swim each night  The hotel is very centrally located we walked to all the sights including Notre Dame the Old City and the Museum of Fine Arts  The breakfast was nothing special but the staff was friendly and helpful and overall I wouldnt hesitate to return  
P => Excellent stay great central location and perfect room The hotel has an excellent central location within minutes you can walk anywhere  Mcgill train station is two blocks away or you can go into Le Bay department store and catch the train from the basement floor  There are several entrances to the underground mall one in the department store and another location on the corner of the church  If you walk on Catherine street you will find lots of currency exchanges restaurants shops and even signs on how to get to the tourist information center they will give you free maps information and advise  A few steps away is a pizza place think its called pizza II not sure that sells good pizza personal pans with diverse toppings  If you get hungry in the middle of the night do not want to go out and have the internet you can order from orderin ca I used that website a couple of times and had food delivered to my room  I had a studio The room is completely clean the bathroom is really nice well lit very roomy tub is pretty big and the water pressure from the shower is amazing they have  settings on the shower head  Its pretty strange that they gave me one robe instead of two considering that I booked it for two people no biggie though The kitchen is beautiful as well there is a full fridgefreezer oven toaster coffee maker water boiler microwave  In the cabinets you will have dishes glasses forks knives spoons and cooking utensils  The oven has a compartment which has pots and pans for your cooking  There is also a dish washing machine the cleaning employee will wash your dishes in the machine if you leave them in the sink or dirty inside the machine however you are provided with soap below the sink  I used the kitchen a lot and constantly would stock up on drinks purchased from a close ket called IGA which you can also enter from the underground mall  The beds are massive very firm I didnt mind it however my boyfriend hated it because it hurt his back pillows are soft and the duvet is warm  The TV has a mountable stand which is great if you are eating in the kitchen and want to watch TV  There is also a box forgive me if I do not know the word for it I attached pictures where you can hook up your computer VGA connector DVD player etc  you have have the proper wires for this  One thing that got me really upset was that the controls for the TV volume had been locked midpoint which was pretty low for a room of the size  If you had the washing machine on and the TV at their max you would not be able to hear it  They give you an ethernet cable to go online with the cable is real short like  foot They shut mine off on the day I was checking out which got me really upset especially since I needed to check the bus schedule The hotel has some great amenities clean pool small gym room with weights and cardio machines patio with beautiful view laundry room The breakfast was OK I guess it was not continental  You have  choices of cereal breads muffins frozen waffles bagels apples and yogurt  Even though it was unlimited It took a lot to fill me up  See the pictures attached of the breakfast room Pros Location clean good amenities big bed full kitchen fast elevators excellent and professional staffCons Bed too stiff TV locked to a very low volume wired internet wired internet shut off the day you are scheduled to depart wished the breakfast was a little bit better 
P => Perfect location perfect room We spent  nights here and were very pleased  The hotel is in a great location very close to downtown St  Catherine street amp the underground shopping within walking distance to the Old Town and we walked to the Bell Center for a hockey game one evening The room was much larger than we had expected and they use high quality linens and towels  Free internet access in the rooms was certainly a plus  They give you an USB cable upon check in to use its not wireless  The area around the hotel seemed very safe at night to walk around and enjoy the evening sights  The hotel staff were very helpful at both check in amp out not simply just being helpful but doing it with genuine smiles upon their faces  Very English friendly  
P => Itall true We stayed at Le Square Phillips after reading all the reviews here  and they are all true  This is a great hotel for families  We had a ior suite with two double beds and the room was absolutely enormous with high high ceilings LCD TV wired internetethernet cable provided with refundable deposit and a full kitchen  Everything was well provisioned for a short or long stay  The kitchen was great for making a fast snack storing beverages and adding a touch of home to a hotel stay  Staff were polite and friendly The pool was small but was well used while we were there  It is beautifully situated on the th floor and has a great outdoor k for relaxing in warmer weather  Swimming in the late afternoon light was terrific  The attached workout room has a number of machinesstability balls and so on for a workout  and there is even a laundry roomThe hotel is located withing walking distance of many sights including old Montreal  Valet parking is   The hotel let us leave our car for the afternoon after we checked out while we continued to explore Our quibbles are small ones and have been mentioned here before  the beds are hard and not the most comfortable but the pillows are great  The duvets are slippery and fall off at night  The included continental breakfast buffet is adequate  middle of the road for these types of things  the juice was watery and the coffee was absolutely horrible good coffee would be a good asset  A sofa would have been a nice addition to the hotel room However overall the rooms and the amenities of this hotel make a visit seamless and stress free  We will return  
P => Rekably good value This was my first stay at Square Phillips usually I stay at the Queen Elizabeth  Corporately the Square Phillips was only slightly less expensive less than  diff but what a value it turned out to be  Booked a ior suite and when I walked in I was amazed    the room never ended  Its hugeKitchenette was nicely stocked with full size fridge and stove dishwasher and microwave plus all needed dishes  Bathroom was huge with a full size tub Huge walkin closet plus another clothes closet The view from my particular room wasnt anything special but that didnt bother me as Im in Montreal really regularly anyway The highspeed wired internet is FREEEThe continental breakfast is FREEMy only suggestion for improvement would be a bit more quotwarmingquot in the or  Its such a huge room that the or seems a bit less than intimate  Still great just could use a bit more quotwarmthquot in the or All in all I will definitely stay here again  Truly terrific value for the money  Clean room courteous staff an overall very good experience  
P => Lovely hotel Perfect   lovely room lovely foyer  Looks newly reated  Self serve buffet breakfast bagelstoastcerealjuices etc   dollar valet parking  All in all a great stay and would return  
P => Great Value Location and Services It  be human nature to write about the places one stays at where disappointment occurs  However in this case I am delighted to write about Square Phillips hotel in Montreal  Well located with very large rooms and very reasonable prices along with free internet with ethernet cable  Having returned recently from abroad the very large rooms were most appreciated  Enjoy  
P => Very good I arrived at the hotel after nightfall and it was quite dark  If you are driving the directions had me on the wrong side of the road so I did a quick u turn  The hotel is easy to get to from the road  I didnt see anywhere to drive into a garage however the bellman was a great help and got all the bags out of the car while I was checking in  He valet the car and brought the bags up to the room  I booked the room under the Fall Sweet Deal though I did get a parking lot view  The room was great  Very big high ceiling large bathroom kitchenette with a dining area  I never used the kitchenette but it had everything one would need to make a meal  The room would easily accomodate a large family with room to spare It also had a large flat screen good selection of channels  The people were very nice and helpful  I always double checked all my directions with them and got everywhere I needed to go  Each time I needed a cab one was called and the bellman was always on the look out for it to arrive  If you are arriving in winter please make sure you pack sturdy boots as the streets are not cleaned well of the snow  This hotel is not connected to the Underground but it is a quick  minute  blocks away  I also lost my wallet on my last night and the hotel did try to do its best to track it down since I lost it in a cab they had called for  No luch luck in recovery but the hotel did go beyond the call of duty to try and help me  I would definitely come back here  
P => Perfect location for families with small kids We ve booked a ior suite with a erate bedroom and kitchen  The room was HUGE clean nice furnished the beds were comfortable the huge bathroom had a bathtub important for our kids and the kitchen equipment was just perfect We got two extra baby beds for our twin babies as well as high chairs  The staff was very helpful and friendly  Nobody was annoyed about us travelling with three little kids  Every mornig we enjoyed the patient staff at the breakfast room and even our kids really likeds the simple but very good breakfast Greetz to GLORIA We were really pleased meeting such a patient helpful and nice person as you areThe location of this hotel is excellent as a lot of nice places can be reached easily by foot and for the larger distances the metro station is in a very short walking distance We will sure book this hotel again once we visit this lovely city again 
P => Loved the Square Phillips Stayed here for the first time after several colleagues raved about it Id always stayed at corporate locations like the Delta or Sheraton before in Montreal  Top notch experience all the way  Large rooms great for a family with two kids  Nice kitchen and table in case you want to pick up some local food at Jean Talon or Atwater kets and bring back  Hotel service is excellent including the front desk and concierge  Warning though if you visit Montreal in the winter the city does not do a great job of snowice removal so bring your boots  Hotel centrally located for easy walks to Rue St Denis Rue Crescent Vieux Montreal etc  I would definitely stay here again whether on business or pleasure  They do have breakfast included and free internet which is great  
P => Lovely spot great staff The staff here were the best They are not out there and over the top as they can be in the States sometimes and altho you are only just over the border there is a cultural difference They were very helpful in room selection for my family and then they organised a cake and balloons for my son on his birthday brought it to our room the next morning and the three front desk guys stood there and sang Happy Birthday How impressed were we We have celebrated alot of birthdays in hotels but never to this standardOur room was very spacious and comfortable and not at all noisy  The breakfast was good  My only complaint is that the pool was too cold  
P => Great location in Montreal We just returned from a trip to Montreal and Quebec  The hotel in Montreal was spacious and accommodating  There is a desk and even a chair to sit in  Since it was ember the weather wasnt ideal so we spent a lot of time watching TV in our room  There is a great selection of English and French channels  The hotel is in a great location  It is near to shopping malls the metro and Ste Catherines street  Our room had a full kitchenette which was wonderful when we tired of eating out  We never made dinner in the room but we did bring left overs from dinner and kept them in the fridge    we could never do that other places we have been The breakfast was good   The breakfast room is clean and bright  There were breads fruits cereals juices tea and coffee  If you must have eggs or you are a breakfast meat eater you must go out  You could even go down to the breakfast with the tray provided in the room and have a already prepared breakfast in the privacy of your own room  There is a pool and workout area  However the pool had way too much chlorine in it  Even after showering we still smelled of chlorine  There is a laundry room as well  It was nice to do a load of laundry while working out  I would have liked to have seen laundry detergent sold in the laundry room  So bring a small thing of detergent or you will have to go to grocery and buy a gigantic bottle of detergent  The staff at the front desk was friendly  They spoke French but had no problem speaking English  I found that in the rest of the province as well  It isnt like the olden days of French only  There were exceptions to this and since they prefer to speak French I did my best  I found that we were very independent in the hotel and we liked it  In some smaller places we have stayed the staff knows every move that we make or is involved in everything that we do    like turning in the key to the desk before leaving the hotel and having to pick it up upon returning    even at  or am  We came and went as we liked  There is a safety deposit box available but no safes in the room  We were happy because I am weirdly protective of my passport This is a great place to stay  
P => Third time NOT the charm Ive stayed at this hotel  previous times and its great but the rd time definitely wasnt the charm Upon arrival the bellhops offered no assistance with our luggage  They actually watched me enter the lobby to retrieve a cart  I was then approached by the bellhop and told quotto make sure I send the cart back down when Im donequot  Gee thanks for your help We were celebrating a friends birthday party at around pm on Friday ober st  We had music playing from a tiny iPod alarm clock  Hotel staff arrived at the door and told us that quotWe had to leavequot  Apparently we were too loud  The gentleman was very rude and unprofessional  He didnt provide a warning or even ask us politely to keep the noise down  Then again it was only pm so what givesThe next day we received a threatening phone call from the front desk telling us quotthat if there were any similar incidents like last night that we would be out of the hotel tonightquot Strangely enough we only received the one visit on the Friday and there were no other problems The hotel itself is great  Amenities are fantastic the rooms are spacious and the location is perfect The hotel staff on the other hand has a lot to learn about hospitality and customer service  Very rude very unprofessional  
P => Hidden Gem My wife and I stayed at Le Square Phillips for the  weekend  Finding the place was a breeze and the valet service was great  Very friendly and informative  Check in was a bit challenging has my reservation was not   accurate  I had changed it earlier in the week but the info was not updated  I always bring a copy of the reservation in case of these problems so after  minutes things were squared away  Gabriel at the front desk was very good in fixing everything  He upgraded us to a  bedroom suite for the goof and holy cow was that room huge  Everything was nice and clean and the bed was nice and firm  Having a full size fridge was great since we could stock up on basics and have quick snacks or leftover smoked meat yum  The hotel is very centrally located and is near all the places we like to go  Walking to Place Des Arts or the Centre Bell is a breeze  We are looking forward to staying again soon  
P => First visit to Montreal My wife and I spent our th wedding anniversary in Montreal at Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites  This is a large hotel located in the heart of the business district but off the main street  We parked our car for  days and just walked to the different areas  The staff was very helpful and friendly  Our room was large free upgrade to suite clean and had a well stocked with kitchen  I would recommend this hotel for both business travelers and families  
P => Dreary Spent  nights in this hotel last month and was just reading back over the reviews  I feel like I stayed in a different hotel  I felt the location was fine very central for shops and sightseeing and I dont mind the lack of a view as you are situated in the middle of a city  But once inside the hotel the rooms and atmosphere I can only describe as dreary and depressing  Our room was very large and the bathroom good and I have to say the rooftop pool was lovely but overall the feeling is somber  Reception amp concierge staff rarely smiled or said hello and it seemed a huge effort for them to do so  We didnt have a bad experience there but for the same price there must be hundreds of far nicer more pleasant hotels in Montreal  
P => Great hotel very friendly staff  We ided to stay at Le Square Phillips Hotel after reading all the good reviews from Tripadvisor  We stayed for  nights and we were very satisfied with the hotel  We had requested a room on a high floor when we booked and we were given a room on the th floor  The highest floor to stay on  On the th floor there was a very useful laundry room the biggest I have experienced in a hotel and a great sunk where you could enjoy the view  The pool was very small and we did not see that many people using it  All the staff were very friendly  The suite attendant was very polite and the room was always beautiful cleaned  The reception staff were very friendly as well  Unfortunately we arrived with only our handluggage   Air Canada had lost our suitcases on the way and the hotel staff were friendly enough to provide us with toothbrushes toothpaste etc  and keep us informed if our suitcases arrived  We had chosen a Studio King the smallest of the suites  But the suite was still very big be a bit to big  I thought it was a long way when I had to find the way to the toilet in the middle of the night   The bed was very comfortable and there was a big flatscreen tv  There was also a dining table and a kitchen  I only missed a sofa that would have been nice to have  The view was not amazing directly down to a parkinglot  but when you looked up you could see the Olympic Stadium  The only irritating thing was the huge fridge that could make a lot of noise in the middle of the night  In some reviews members have been disappointed with the free continental breakfast  We were extremely satisfied  The women who worked in the breakfast lounge were so friendly and worked so hard  They cleaned the tables so fast so there were always clean tables to sit at  You could choose between bread bagels waffles muffins croissants different types of cereal fresh fruit and yougurt  There were also different type of juices to choose from  We never experienced that they ran out of something even if we came late  We could not see any computers in the lobby but when we asked we were told they had a business center in the back where you can use the computer for  minutes at a time that was very nice The area is very good for shopping with The Bay and Underground city just a few minutes walk away  There are also some nice restaurants just next to the hotel and a Burger King  We were suprised to see so many beggars in the area though  We have been in a lot of big cities but this city must be the one where we have experienced the most  but we never felt unsafe though  We can highly recommend Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites and there is so much to see in Montreal  
P => Creat location This hotel exceeded my expectations  I thought no hotel could be as goood as the TripAdvisor reviews were rating it  I was wrong  this place is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in  The rooms are huge with the high ceilings adding to the roomy feel of the place  It was a great location to re discover Montreal after  years away 
P => wow large rooms a group of us stayed for two nights  excellent large rooms with kitchen and large bathroom  comfortable beds nice lcd tv free internet  would be great for long staying guests with the kitchen fully equipped reception staff were helpful and attentive  
P => Couldnt ask for more We stayed at this hotel  adults one child in ust  A great location walking distance to most everywhere we went  A nice walk to Old Montreal  We had breakfast at the little coffehouse down the street twice  We had dinner at the French  restaurant down the street as well  Both were lovely  The room was huge the beds were comfortable the roofk was nice too  Couldnt ask for anything more  
P => Definitely worth the reviews We spent  nights in a spacious one bedroom suite overlooking Blvd  Rene Levesque  Pleasant at the front desk large rooms comfortable beds and just a homey feel with a good kitchen and a great shopping location as well as a reasonable walk from some of the downtown restaurants Quibbles A few  Breakfast was indifferent  While these buffet breakfasts tend to have a sameness to them this was the least appealling of those we have encountered The room was not ready even at  on the day we arrived which was less than acceptable Concierges were not as knowledgeable about the city and restaurants as one would like In a hotel attracting a cross section of people the Globe and Mail is preferable to the dull National Post  These quibbles aside this is a perfect spot for families or individuals or couples on a longer stay  Ill be back next week  
P => Great hotel  Great location We stayed at le Square Philipps hotel in the middle of ust for  nights     The location is perfect just off St  Catherine str which is the main commercial street with the famous department store quot The Bay quot  Its about  minutes walk to Old Montreal and Old Port but when you walk out the hotel on the left is boulv  Rene Levesque where you can take the bus  and you can get off at the Old Port at the place Jacques Cartier Rooms are very spacious clean with a fully furnished kitchen and very quiet The coplimentary breakfast is basic and simple but fresh and especially the bagels are very delicious The staff is nice and very helpful in making suggestions and always with a big smileI would highly recommend the Italian pizza quot Il Focolaio quot  when you walk out the hotel its about m  on the right they serve  kind of pizza I would recommend this superb hotel to everyone especially to families with kids and I would stay here again  
P => Loved this spacious place  This hotel was a superb start to our vacation in Canada  Having arrived from a transatlantic flight with a three year old you need things to be easy and it was  The check in staff were very nice and efficient asking if we had a computer with us as there is no Wi Fi but they provided an Ethernet cable for in room hook up The room was more a studio very spacious and clean comprising of two double beds huge LCD TV fully equipped kitchen area table and four chairs plenty of closet space and a lovely on suite bathroom A complimentary breakfast was included this could be taken in the breakfast area or in your room  This was wonderful and had every kind of bread muffin cereal tea coffee etc The pool and leisure facilities are excellent not to mention the view from the pool area The location of the hotel is great you are only a few meters away from the major stores and the underground shopping area and walk ways  The other way you are a  minute walk from the old town and waterfront  We would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Le Square Phillips Is in the Heart of Montreal and Wonderful Everything about our stay in this hotel was wonderful  The staff was helpful the rooms incredibly spacious and the price for the service was excellent  The as much as you want continental breakfast had enough variety to certainly hold one over until lunch  We would definitely go back  
P => You can find better hotels in Montreal I have been visiting Montreal on a regular basis for the last  years and have stayed in a large number of nice hotels in the city  One thing I know the Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites is not in the top  places to stay in the city  After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I figured that I must be missing something plus this hotel was a good location for the Jazz Festival  This is a standard hotel with larger that normal rooms that seem even larger because of the high ceilings  The rooms also have a kitchenette  The bed was one of the worst that I have ever tried to sleep on very hard and uncomfortable  This might be a good place if you are staying with a family and need a larger room but even then it is not that great  Anyway there are many other hotels in Montreal that are a lot nicer in the same price range look around  
P => What a great hotel We recently stayed  nights at the Square Phillips and can find nothing negative to say about it  The location is fantastic the conversion from multi storey warehouse to loft like hotel is very stylish and the staff are professional and friendly  Our ior King Suite was enormous with high ceilings  flatscreen TVs and a view of the Square itself We did not sample the free breakfast   instead we walked  minutes to a large superket in the Complexe Desjardins and made our own breakfast in the suite  Will definitely stay there again  
P => very pleased Great for families    huge clean rooms with big kitchenette and nice downtown location close to shopping and dining  Free breakfast with nice and kid friendly staff  would certainly return here  
P => Great location but    Weve stayed at this hotel in the beginning of ust   As said by others the rooms are very large with very high ceilings so you feel really in a big room  The kitchenettes are perfect the rooms clean the people at the front desk very kind  We also enjoyed much the roof top pool and terrace There are only  small and managable problems the breakfasts and the bed  The breakfasts are very very basic the coffee is undrinkable thanks god there is a second cup just  steps away and the little breakfast room crowded  The beds are    lets not say quotuncomfortablequot but less than comfortable  The king bed looked super and the big pillows attractive but after  full nights of playing quotcatch the feather coverquot because the fabric was too slippery and trying to find a position on the too big pillows we didnt feel much relaxed    Nevertheless we would strongly consider going back with be our own pillows and considering eating somewhere else the location is so great with St Catherine street juste near and restaurants and everything and with the terrace view the rooms are so practical to invite our friends to come and have a lunch that it is still a great place to go 
P => Nice The hotel is very nice spacious rooms which is good for kids  good location the staff was very friendly  The only minus was the free breakfast   too crowded too disorganized and the food was very so so   
P => Too many people for hotel to handle The sad thing about internet reviews especially when they are very good is that it attracts too many people trying to find the quotbest kept secretquot and avoid the crowds  Too late  The word is out and what made this hotel attractive is no longer the case  The elevators are crowded and slow  Retrieving your car is a   minute wait and it is a good thing that the free continental breakfast is free since that makes up for the crowded conditions  To top it off you have a choice between spacious rooms and rooms with a view for Square Phillips does not offer both in the same room  The best thing about the rooms is the loft atmosphere since the ceilings are  feet high  Our children liked the fact that they could plug in their dvd palyers and watch their movies for free rather than pay   to watch a family movie from the rental selection  The beds though are uncomfortable  The swimming pool area has a sign quotMaximum  people can fit in this poolquot 
P => Nice but not a good match for a single traveler I traveled without my family and stayed at this hotel for  nights  Its a very nice hotel   clean quiet and well maintained  The rooms are very large and come with a complete kitchenette which is more than I needed  There is no safe in the room but you can store valuables in the hotel safe The hotel is well situated its about a   minute walk from Old Montreal and just off St Catherine which is a long shopping street  Its about a half hour walk to Mont Royal  a lot of it uphill  I didnt use the Metro but you could avoid a lot of walking if you do There is an indoor lap pool on the top floor and a laundry facility  There are no chairs at the pool itself you have to go through doors to sit outside on the terrace which faces a lot of tall office buildings The staff was very nice and made dinner reservations for me in restaurants I picked out but not all that helpful in making suggestions  They were very good with giving directions If I had to do it again as a single traveler I would stay at a smaller more intimate hotel or a bed and breakfast  This place would be very good for a family  
P => Great Montreal Downtown Location This is the first time that our Agency has booked this Hotel  Front Desk were very friendly and Hospitable Located a half a block off St Catherine Street Walking Distance to great shopping and many of Montreals finest restaurants  Within walking distance of Via rail Station only  city blocks away Conceirge service was very helpful with all our requests and Information  I would suggest the  hour greyline city tour at    per person  They pick you up at hotel Rooms were a great size nice pool and sitting area on the roof of Hotel overlooking city Very clean spacious large flatt screen TVs in rooms  Stove fridge dishes and dishwasher and dining area all in room Excellent location amp servce and price was not out of this world  
P => Great Hotel Our family had a great stay at this Hotel  We got a room upgrade without asking and had a large  bedroom Suite  There is a rooftop pool and an outdoor area on the roof that you can just sit and enjoy the Montreal skyline  The location of the Hotel is perfect and when you walk out the door there are numerous sidewalk restaurants that serve a variety of very good food  The staff was very helpful and friendly   This is a suite Hotel with a fully furnished kitchen and would be great for families or someone who did not want to eat out or use room service for every meal There is no hotel bar and the restaurant was not open late but these are available right outside the Hotel  
P => What a great surprise The facade of the hotel is very plain and it is near Phillips Square   so the surroundings were a bit dirty noisy and quite busy  However we were most pleasantly surprised to find that for the price we paid we got a HUGE room with a full kitchen  It was comfortable quiet cool and clean  Free internet access tooThere were  of us sharing two double beds but there was enough space in the room to do cartwheels  Another nice surprise was the free breakfast buffet   which you could have in the breakfast room or take back to your room The hotel right by Phillips Square where there are numerous restaurants and the Bay  It is also near St  Catherine Street where there are lots of shops and where Eaton Centre is located  Old Quebec is about a  minute walk away  
P => Perfect place to stay in Montreal and would repeat Followed the reviews from Trip Advisor and stayed here  Excellent all the way around and would definitely recommend Le Square Phillips  Very friendly staff especially the concierges guys  I took the  per day valet parking which was a great choice to go in and out as needed  We had ior  King bed suite which was very spaceous for our family of   The location is walking distance     mts to many tourist spots in old montreal and great restaurants in either direction  My kids liked the hard rock cafe which we walked too  
P => Great hotel at perfect location We a family of  stayed at the Square Phillips for  nights in begining of y while the Jazz Festival was on  The staff was both pleasant professional and very helpful and the hotel is clean and just a very nice place to stay for both business and pleasure  However the breakfast could need a makeover  It wasnt very interestingThe suite   a family suite   was enourmous with  flatscreens free internet access and a large kitchen  The pool area is nothing to speak about but it is placed on the th  floor with a large k outside where one can enjoy views of the city The location couldnt be more central in town  Right by the shopping district and the underground city   minutes walk to the Place dArt    minutes to the business district and the old town Only warning Do not eat at the overpriced and not very good Italian restaurant adjacent to the lobby not a part of the hotel  There is a very good reason why there are so few guests 
P => Great Service Central Location Huge Room We followed other Tripadvisor members advice and stayed at Le Square Phillips for  nights in late e  Four of us  teens  adults shared a  bed studio single room  The beds were extremely comfortable  The kitchen area was nearly as big as a second room and featured a table for two along with a full refrigerator microwave stove and dishwasher  A full continental breakfast with cereals fruit yogurt waffles etc was served every morning The hotel was a  minute walk from Vieux Montreal  It was also just down the block from Saint Catherine Street a very long street in downtown Montreal with lots of shops ideal for teenagers  An entrance to the Underground Mall was also  block away  There is an excellent pizza restaurant a few doors down from the hotel they serve  types of pizza that we loved and highly recommend  Staff were very nice and accommodating  We had to valet park our car night but the price included inout privileges and we never waited more than  minutes when we wanted the car we walked almost everywhere  The hotel includes a rooftop pool but it is only accessible by one ladder at one end and the entire pool is about  deep   ideal for swimming laps but not good for young children  There is also a coin operated laundry room next to the pool area   a plus for families traveling with children We were very pleased with this hotel and would stay here again  We usually stay at riott type hotels   this was fully comparable  
P => Great deal Great location This was my second stay at the Square Phillips Hotel  You cannot beat the price and it has a great location right in the heart of Montreal  You can walk to almost everything right from your hotel  The rooms are big clean and come with a kitchenette amp fridge  I even used the weight room swimming pool and k all located on the roof  This is not a posh super service place but so what  It has all the amenities you need  It is great for families  There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel however you can walk out your front door and theres a dozen places to choose from in sight Well worth giving a try  
P => Second stay at the Phillips Square We stayed here during JazzFest  Our room on the th floor was spacious clean and very quiet  The staff at the front desk and the parking staff  were less helpful and patient than they were on our previous visit  None the less we certainly will stay here again  
P => Great Hidden Gem I have just returned from a night at the Square Phillips  The hotel is wonderful and I have never felt so much at home  I stayed on the th floor and my room overlooked the street  The view wasnt very impressive but that was easily made up by rooftop terrace Breakfast is continental with fruits muffins bagels cereals juices and hot drinks  During the rest of the day if you get hungry you can make a meal or snack in your room as each room has a fully equipped kitchen  There is a full sized fridge oven dishwasher microwave and toaster  The pool is nice small but nice  The only drawback is that because of the pools size they ask that no more then  people be in the pool at a time  On the same floor as the pool there is a small workout room and a terrace that lets you see all the view that you  not have from your room  Even on a rainy day it was still lovely For those that dont want to cook there some nice restaurants in the area  Everything from pizza and italian to typical fast food  There were three of us and we shared a one king bed room with a rollaway bed for the third person  Prior to seeing the room I was worried that the bed wouldnt fit after seeing the room I know it would be no problem Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in Montreal  It is very close to the Metro McGill station is closer not Place Victoria as was originally told to us by a subway employee Eaton Centre numerous other shopping centres and St  Catherines St I would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone and everyone  
P => Great Choice for City Location We only stayed one night at Le Square Phillips but for a centrally located hotel in the city combined with the accomodations I would certainly make this my choice in Montreal Via the Tourism Montreal site I had originally booked this room on their  price off third night special which would have been a great value but due to a change in travel plans I ided to stay in Old Montreal at a B amp B which for a first time visitor Im glad we did   loved this quotoldquot area as a base then retuned to this hotel for one nightday after a trip to Quebec City for four days First   it was a great location for the Jazz festival  Close enough to the free concernts within two blocks but far enough away from the scene  The hotel itself is very close another two blocks to the train station VIA RAIL metro is within a block and the hotel is central to the quotundergroundquot shoppingeating and numerous numerous shopping options at the street level St Catherine street is one of the bordering streets on this square and is a mass mecca of retailers if thats your interest  The popular quotLe Bayquot department store also is on this block  Few good fast food type restaurants right outside your door   with street side under tent seating in the good weather  Pizza place right next door was great and very popular with the locals so that gave us a good hint to try it out Museum mile is also within a few blocks   so as said   this location is very accessible to a lot of what the inner city offers  Hotel itself  as said many times in previous reviews is built for a family  Roomssuites are enormous  We stayed in a King Studio only two of us which is the smallest accomodation and with the kitchen table and full kitchen area it was very very spacious  Our room was extremely clean all amenities kitchen ware glassware plates everything you would need to cook in was spotless and plentiful  Good size bathroom spacious and clean  Very updated  Plenty of dresser space closet space  Large windows we overlooked the square  New flat screen TV large and bedding was comfortable  For an extended stay this place is ideal Hotel itself our floor was quiet and the continental breakfast was the usual   but plentiful toast bagels criossants cereal waffles fresh fruit juices and coffee amp tea  No complaints at all  Staff was very nice and helpful in our contacts with them check in taxi service and baggage service  It rained the entire time we were here and due to the short time we never got to even see the pool  But a family full of kids in the elevator soaking wet said it was just fine rain or shine For the quick stay we had and an opinion based on that   I wouldnt hesitate to stay here upon return to Montreal especially iin the value your get with the full kitchen options in the accomodation and the quotlargenessquot of the rooms as a whole  Excellent value  
P => Just Right We stayed from e   in a ior Suite  Convient to the Jazz Festival yet a quiet reprieve when we needed it  Huge comfortable room with a full well appointed kitchen  Lovely roof k but the pool is too small for real swimming  There is a complete grocery IGA a few blocks away in the lower level of the Place desJardins and the Hyatt Hotel for wine cheese pastries fruit and snacks We would gladly stay here again  J amp J Putney VT 
P => Had a great stay Checked in from    in a ior Suite  Great and spotless Kitchen well appointed room top furniture Hotel located in the middle of everything TripAdvisor  Winner and best reviews  Free continental breakfast nice rooftop excercise and indoor swimming pool  Very friendly staff  And moderate prices too  Will be my future choice for sure And believe me I travel a lot and I have seen poor rooms for an awful amout of money  Here it is really worth staying  
P => great space good value basic accomodations Good location huge room with kitchen perfect for families  Furniture was basic and no thought put into design  small gym and convenient breakfast area but no public areas room service restaurant business centre or bar etc  there is an independent restaurant attached to the lobby but much better can be found with a short stroll  expected more given the high reviews  its a winner in terms of value but dont expect luxury or design  motel ish rooms though the one i stayed in was very large  
P => HUGE Rooms My husband son dhter mother in law and I stayed for about a week at Le Square Phillips Hotel in y  around the time of the annual Montreal Jazz Festival  It ended up being the perfect locale for the festival which took place just a few blocks away mostly at the Place des Arts  We rented a two bedroom suite   which was immense There was a large kitchen with full size fridge full stoveoven microwave dining area with six chairs and a huge living room with beautiful view of Phillips Square  One of the bedrooms even had a walk in closet  The service was superb and the downtown location was convenient to metro stops and many restaurants  Theres even a La Baie department store down the street The hotels rooftop features an indoor pool small fitness center and terrace from where you can see fireworks from the jazz festival Each morning theres a complimentary continental breakfast that will help jumpstart a day of sightseeing or business The only downside to the hotel is that its not located in the charming Vieux Montreal area but as a result its also not as touristy  All tourist sites are a short metro ride away I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely stay there again on our next trip to beautiful Montreal 
P => Third times a charm What can I say that the other reviews did not mention This is my third stay here and not the last  I come to Montreal often for business and love this place  The central location helpful front desk massive rooms with kitchens eating out gets boring fattening and expensive and great internet connection make it a no brainer  Throw in the plushy robes and I am soldMy one quibble is the exercise room  It is a bit tired and small but this is a  not  star place  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great Value for a family We stayed at this hotel because it was highly rated on Trip Advisor and provided high class family accommodation at an affordable price We were not disappointed  Check in was very friendly and a cable was provided for room wi fi access  The room with full kichen was very spacious  We had booked a de luxe two bedroom suiteone king and one queen with a double pulldown bed available in the living area Including taxes the total cost came to under  Canadian  Valet parking at  Canadian is highly recommended and efficient  The concierges were very helpful and booked us on the three hour Gray Line Montreal City Tour which included a free pickup and return to the tour starting point at the Montreal Information Center at Peel Street The hotel is very close to the vast underground St  Catherines Street shopping area  The concierges provided recommendations on nearby eating places  There is a Zia Trattoria on site which will also deliver to your room but we chose to walk up the street and found a couple of very reasonanably priced restaurants  We ate at El Focalio which provided excellent pizza and pasta  next door was Le Grand Comptoir which provided french rustic cooking The gem inside the hotel was its roof top terrace and it was simply delightful to take a bottle of wine and glasses up from the room and relax there and enjoy the skyline  The rooftop also includes an excellent heated indoor pool and a fitness center The concierge also helpfully directed us to Vieux Montreal which was full of interesting sites and restaurants Overall highly recommended and incredibly good value for a downtown big city location  
P => A warm welcome to a wonderful city Just returned from a  night stay in Montreal at Le Square Phillips while attending a conference at another hotel and cant say enough good things about this lovely hotel From the moment we arrived  before we even got out of the cab   we were made to feel welcome by the amazing staff  Our room was so spacious spotlessly clean quiet and comfortable  Their kitchenette boasts a FULL sized fridge stove dishwasher microwave toaster kettle potspans dishes the works  Basic but good choice for breakfast which is included in your rate  Free high speed internet and they provide cables to connect if you dont have one The location is unbeatable  Phillips Square is lovely  Metro stations are minutes away as are numerous restos and stores on St  Catherine Street  Walking distance to the old city too I would recommend Le Square Phillips to anyone   and cant wait to return some day 
P => above average hotel and staff excellent location with fine continental breakfast and friendly efficient staff   This will be my future montreal stop its centrally located and the folks are easy to deal with well be back 
P => Best price I have stayed at this hotel twice before broth for the Montreal Sounds an Image fest  The  Bedroom suite is HUGE  Full kitchen  Very clean  quiet  comfy beds   good food for breakfast    And I absolutely LOVE the pizza in the little restaurant attached in the front  Always have a couple when I am staying Thin crust well done    I am staying here in il for  night for the UFC fight and am already craving the pizza    haha  
P => st Pattys Amazing weekend I have lived in montreal for  years I have stayed at numerous hotels downtown after a night of partying  The Square Phillips hotel amp suites has by far exceeded my expectations and then some  After booking online very convinient for my girlfriends birthday i needed some information regarding the reservation and check in procedures  They were very helpful and prompt with their responses and knew what they were doing  The room i had which was the family suite upon entering left me speechless  The shear size of the room was beyond anything ive ever experienced at any hotel  The two bedrooms kitchen and extremely large bathroom made me feel right at home  The two bedrooms themselves were the size of a regular room at your local super   The kitchen complete with stove dishwasher microwave full size refridgerator utensils glasses and plates was quite spacious with a  seat table  The cleanliness was far beyond any hotel i have ever stayed in  The staff was amazing prompt and courteous  I have never felt more welcome and valued as a customer at any other hotel  I would definately recommend to anyone coming in from out of town to experience life in montreal  It is in a prime location  blocks from all major stores and a block away from underground shopping  I truely loved my stay and would never think twice about staying here again  It was truely an experience that i shall never forget  
P => HUGE room great price We stayed in a Family suite for  CA  This was by far the biggest hotel room we have ever booked  Check out the hotels photos  Its not trick photography the rooms are really this big Upon arrival on   we were informed that  cm of snow was predicted  Immediately we booked a second night  The staff at the front desk is friendly professional etc  and they all speak English very well that was most helpful  Breakfast  We are a family of  and everyone found plenty of choices  Croissants coffee hot chocolate yogurt fruit cereal bagels etc  and its included  Note You must valet park your car The hotels location is perfect  As the name indicates its in Phillips Square so youll find the spot on any map  Theres lots of shopping in the area if that interests you  We walked to Notre Dame and then to the Quays and a science museum  Typically theres ice skating there too but of course there was too much snow  Take a  taxi to Lexpress  They serve the most incredible French food and very impressive wine list  They dont advertise  You might find a little info on the web  
P => Still the Best Just completing  nites at Le Square Phillips  This is second stay at LSP and it continues to impress at every level  Location is terrific   a few blocks either way to the Orange or the Green Metro lines   or just enter the underground Montreal tunnel network also close by  As a recycled warehouse building it appeals in many ways   including high ceilings and rooms with generous floor plans  Service is just right for me quiet modest efficient   and enough  Breakfast is continental and plentiful  Internet is available for my laptop   or in the quotbusiness centerquot on the hotels computers  Got snowed in this weekend   and the front desk was very helpful and accommodating  Overall I would say this is one of the best hotels Ive stayed at   without slipping into the too many stars adence that money can buy if that appeals to you  
P => Exceptional Service I and my family stayed in this hotel from  th to th  We found the service in this hotel one of the best so far The only thing that the hotel could improve on is adding eggs to the breakfastOther than this the hotel deservs to be    in montreal  
P => Four star accommodations We were looking for a hotel in Montreal that would be very close to the U S  Consulate  After coming across Le Square Phillips and reading the glowing reviews here on trip advisor we booked a two bedroom suite for two nights  The cost was a bit steep  per night plus  per night for parking adding in taxes it came to   per night  This was mitigated by the location just around the corner from the Consulate and the lovely photos on the hotel website plus the numerous positive comments here about the service and cleanliness  The suite was quite large and did have a fully equipped kitchen including stove with oven microwave dishwasher  small appliances dishes cutlery etc etc  I was a bit surprised that the room was not spotlessly clean   there were numerous fingerprints on walls drip ks on the bathroom wallsdoor and bits of something on the inside of the microwave  The carpeting also had a large patch in the dining area and in the larger bedroom the carpet was frayed it had obviously been damaged by being cht in the vacuum cleaner  In spite of this the room did seem comfortable enough   at least I thought so until about am   I had gone to sleep around pm   we had to be up at am   I awoke around am and discovered that my husband was on the extreme far edge of the king sized bed we were sharing  I asked him what was going on and he told me that there was something wrong with the mattress   we had noticed earlier in the evening that his side squeaked quite loudly while my side did not  We both got out of bed and examined the mattress more closely and it was obviously damaged on his side   with the sheet pulled back you could see that the side of the mattress was buckled quite noticeably  Looking down at the top of the mattress you could see a definite slope on that side  We had to be up in  hours time and did not want the hassle of calling the front desk at am so we shared my side of the bed   ending up with a sleeping area roughly the size of a double bed  After arriving back at the hotel around am we contacted the front desk and told them the problem  They said they would send someone up to look at the mattress  About an hour later and after one more phone call the response we received was quotthey will get there when they have timequot someone showed up and removed the mattress and box springs replaced them with new and told us that housekeeping would be along in a bit to make up the bed  The damaged mattress should be been noticed by housekeeping staff when the bed was being made up but then the housekeeping staff did not notice the food splatters in the microwave or the fingerprints on the walls either  We debated staying the second night but ided to check out and make the five hour drive home that day  We did not receive an apology  I would have taken photos of the room but shortly after arriving we discovered that the camera battery was dead and my son had left the charger at home  I would not stay at this hotel a second time  
P => A true jewel a hotel that reflects Montreals class Staying at this gorgeous hotel was like coming to my dream home every night  The high ceilings the gorgeous pillars the lighting the bathroom it was a wonderful experience  No picture can capture that properly so youll just have to stay in it and prove it yourself  It is also located in a great part of Montreal amazing for shopping We took advantage of low season prices and it blew our previous tiny hostal away by less than  dollars  If you truly want to live the Montreal experience in whole which is FANCY to say the least then stay at Le Square Phillips  
P => MIxed Feelings about Le Square Phillips After reading the reviews on this site I was unided about whether or not to risk this hotel such that I had another reservation at the Delta Centre Ville  I finally opted to take a chance and we spent  nights at this hotel THE LOCATIONYou cannot beat this location  Steps from The Bay and the shopping on Ste Catherine  We were also walking distance from the Palais de Congr s where we were attending the Car Show  So I can only say this is an ideal location THE ROOMWell it was huge  We opted for a ior Suite with a kingsize bed  The suite was the size of an apartment which was great BEDSThe bed was one of the worst hotel beds Ive ever slept on  Both my husband and I had sore backs after our first night  As for the pull out sofa bed it was just fine for our  year old son but I doubt it would be comfortable for an adult for a full night  And I cannot imagine that a couple could share the bed    it is too small  The standard pillows are brutal but you can easily get feather pillows by asking at the front desk BATHROOMEnormous bathroom with excellent water pressure in the shower  Bathroom did not have a fan which would have been nice THE POOLA pool is a main amenity for us as our toddler loves the water  It served our needs mainly because we were the only ones there  It is a small pool with a maximum capacity of  people  It is about   feet deep the length of the pool and I would estimate it to be about  feet wide and about  feet long  The temperature was a little cool but certainly bearable  A great view as the pool is on the roof of the hotel BREAKFASTA typical continental breakfast toast bagels croissants pastries cereals fresh fruit juices coffee yogurt  Nothing extraordinary but certainly enough to get your day started PRICEIn my view this hotel is overpriced  The standard price for our ior Suite is   We took advantage of the Sweet Deals promotion offerred by Tourisme Qu bec where you pay for one night and the second night is half price httpwww tourisme montreal orgBCdefault asp  Even with the deal I felt the room was overpriced compared to what you can get in this price range in Montreal  While we would have had a smaller room elsewhere the beds would have been much better  CONCLUSIONGlad we tried it but I wont stay here again    unless we get a much cheaper deal and my back is prepared for the horrible bed  Next time I will stay at hotels which have provided better accomodations at a better price Hyatt Regency Delta Centre Ville InterContinental Hilton Bonaventure XIX Si cle Doubletree Hilton  
P => We really liked it a lot A great weekend stay in Montreal at an excellent hotel Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable  The valet parking was wonderfull as it was around  F and the car was parked in a warm garage next to the hotel  Note Beware parking in Montreal is typically hard to find on the street and the parking rules are Top Secret known only by the parking enforcememnt police  I am convinced that they target out of Canada ie US cars  A good way to start a fierce argument is to ask two locals the question quotCan I park herequotRooms were super clean with functional furniture and the housekeeping staff went out of their way to keep us supplied with towels shampoo etc etc It is right across the square from the Bay department store where one can enter underground Montreal which again was nice considering the cold Plenty of area shops for everything one could desire Easy access to the main highways into and out of Montreal which is also a plus I would recommend a king bed for two people as the double bed in the ior double bed suite was a bit small for two typicalAmericans  Also a bit on the firm side which I like but my fiance was not crazy about All around a great stay in a great hotel in a great location  Montreal is a fine city  
P => Great Getaway We stayed in a suite at Le Square Phillips for two nights and were very satisfied with the price the staff and the rooms  We were a little put off at first as when we arrived the rooms were not ready and it was well past the check in time  However once registered we were so pleased with the spacious clean rooms that the wait seemed trivial  The staff was helpful and friendly  Note the pool is NOT heated  The hotel is located in easy walking distance from many downtown sights and is near the Metro line  There are many restaurants within a few blocks    We especially liked Chez Eric right around the corner  Overall we would recommend and return to this hotel  
P => You Couldnt Ask For More Its been a week since we stayed at Le Square Phillips and I am still in awe  Everything about the hotel was absolutely wonderful the front desk staff were very helpful Bonjour Annie the  huge  suite was clean and the kitchenette well stocked the concierege knowledgeable    I only wish Id brought my bathing suit to check out the pool Theres good shopping and great restaurants right at the doorstep too  A fantastic place to stay 
P => Superb place for families Le Square Phillips was a terrific place for us to stay  We spent a week there in late summer with our two kids toddlers and my sisters husband and  kids infant and toddler just down the hall  We picked this hotel because it ranked well on Trip Advisor for families  and  it even made the singles list for top hotels in Montreal  The rooms are very large and comfortable  After one breakfast in the breakfast room we shifted gears to simply bringing breakfast to our rooms  The location pool roof k and laundry were all very good  I particularly liked the nice design touches including framed prints of architectural drawings in the hallways I recommend this hotel highly for people who want some extra room in their hotel and who loathe a standard impersonal hotel room  
P => Good hotel   excellent value We were in Montreal in ober for holidays  After much research and reading the good reviews in Tripadvosor we chose Le Square Phillips  It was as good as what previous reviews said  The apartment was very roomy with high ceilings It was clean well equipped and the bed was very comfortable  The laundry room on the top floor was always neat and clean  We didnt use the pool which looked well maintained  The continental breakfasts included in the cost were tasty and healthy  Free internet access for guests from the hotel business centre was a bonus  Hotel staff were very freindly and most helpful  The hotel was very central and easy access to all tourist locations as we managed to walk to most places  So glad we found this exceptionally good value hotel on Tripadvisor  
P => One More Pleasantly Surprised Customer Frankly I wondered what all the fuss was about but I have to agree with most everyone else after a weekend at Le Square Phillips  The location was excellent the price was good the staff were helpful and pleasant the rooms were enormous and quiet and everything was spotlessly clean  It was great having wine glasses and an opener in the room as well as plates and a dishwasher  I tried to come up with anything I didnt like and finally ided the pillows arent as comfortable as they could be  They are made out of solid chunks of foam rubber and are not soft enough  Ive stayed in more expensive and prettier hotels but I doubt if Ill stay anywhere else in Montreal again  
P => Best in Montreal After reading TripAdvisor I made a reservation for  days at Le Square Phiilips  If you want an impressive huge lobby this is not the place  If you want great value a large clean room with ammenties just make your reservation  They must has just remmodeled recently  The rooms have  foot ceilings with a dining table and even a small spotless kitchen  I had special wierd requests before my stay and they accommodated everything Great friendly service from the guest services concierge management  Location was excellent  Close to shopping movies great restaurants  Try the pizza place and the rustic french restaurant next door  I wish they had sister hotels in other cities  I stay in a lot of hotels and this one made me happy to come home to every night after my work in Montreal  
P => As good as everyone says  My wife and I spent  nights at Le Square Phillips prior to joining acruise  We chose it because past guests rate it No   in Montreal   and oh how right they all areFrom my first contact with the concierge prior to our stay the staff were wonderful   polite friendly and helpful  The location is perfect being around  metres from access to the main underground shopping area and within reach of several excellent value restaurants The rooms are large almost suites and are very clean   spotless would be the best description  If we had one slight complaint it would be that the continental breakfast although of good quality was a little limited in choice Le Square Phillips deserves its place as Trip Advisor members first choice  
P => best kept secret When your own Montreal born and raised family have never heard of it you know its a tiny gem yet to be discovered  This hotel is fantastically situated a short walk to everything even a grocery store  With the cute little kitchen its nice to be able to store nibblies   especially when youre toting kids  The rooms are crazy big and so clean and crisp  Its a boutique hotel with none of the arrogance one would expect from something so neat and chic  I love the rooftop k   while the kids swim in the indoor pool its possible to bring your own drinks to the adjacent outdoor kchairs and take in the last bit of sun before heading out for the night  My only complaint and its more a nuisance than anything is when its busy you can wait for a table at breakfast which is included because the dining space is a little tight  But the coffee is fantastic and they serve Montreal St  Viateur bagels amp cream cheese among other things   but what else counts  Truly great value and well deserves its   spot  
P => Good deal but    We stayed  nights at the beginning of tember at the Square Philips and it was the right choice as we were travelling with  small kids and my mother  The room was huge we hade two arate bed rooms and a very large kitchen dining sitting area  The swimming pool was great with very nice views of Montreal Thats on the good side What I didnt appreciate was breakfast which is served in a cantine like room and has absolotely the charm of one none at all  Breakfast in itself is basic bagels bread melade peanut butter and philadelphia cheese cereals and coffee and thats it The hotel served our needs large rooms with a kitchen  swimming pool it is clean staff is friendly and it is well situated for shopping tours but if I were looking for a quotcharmingquot hotel I would not return there  
P => Great hotel especially for longer stays I recently spent  nights at the Square Phillips Hotel while attending a conference that was held at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Fairmont  The rooms at the Square Phillips are enormous  very high ceilings and two large windows that let in lots of light and nice nighttime vistas of the city  I booked their smallest option but had a king sized bed and  closets a full kitchen bigger than what many people in Manhattan have in their homes  Bathroom was large and all was very clean  The free high speed internet access was great since I was working for part of my trip  The staff were always very friendly and helpful  I enjoyed the small gym adjacent to the lap pool  These are on the roof along with a nice terrace with great views of the city and Mont Royal  Just half a block off of St  Catherine with lots of shops and restaurants and near the McGill metro  The building is very solid and our room was always quiet  I never heard other guests except an occasional elevator door closing  I took advantage ofa Montreal tourist board promotion quotSweet Dealquot and got  off the cost of the rd and th nights  We will definitely stay here again  Thanks for the good tip Tripadvisor travelers  
P => Wonderful spot Trip Advisor had it right this is an excellent hotel  The rooms were enormous having a kitchen was a much appreciated convenience the location was perfect a down hill walk to the old city the staff was always courteous and most important the price was right  The hotel was conveniently located near a metro stop so we could enjoy the Montreal ket St  Denis etc  The exercise facility is much better than your average hotels and I found the laundry facility to be very convenient especially on a long trip  This hotel has everything you need for the right place  Book it if you can  
P => A good choice Comfortable large quotsuitesquot i e  rooms with kitchenette well equipped with a large fridge hob oven and microwave  Well maintained  Quiet at night if you don t mind the noise from the fridge  Well located for the shops walkable under  mins to the Old Town Chinatown and the Village  Near the metro for a short journey to the Plateau  Would stay again   but do offer two tips for other travellersThe inclusive continental breakfast is quite limited in choice and available in a noisy over crowded breakfast room   so it is worth knowing that the hotel encourages you to use the tray in your room to stock up on items from the breakfast room and bring them back to eat in your own suite and of course that allows you to supplement the hotel s food with your favourite breakfast things bought from a local superket  mins walk The Italian restaurant attached to the lobby which will deliver pizzas and salads to your room is of only so so quality and expensive by Montreal standards  There are other local takeaway s which you can bring back yourself  
P => Good Value Now its my turn to finally review this hotel  Overall its a great value the rooms are spacious and the hotel is located in the heart of Monteal  When we arirved they overbooked the hotel  a film crew stayed one more day than was originally scheduled  They profusely apologized for this inconvenience and sent us along with a couple of other families to the Embassy Suites for one night in Vieux Montreal Old Montreal  They comped the first night and gave us a free room upgrade  It turned out to be the opening day for this Embassy Suites so every thing in the hotel is brand new  The experience was very positive  They have great cosy comforters and a chef can prepare you an omelet as part of the complimentary breakfast  Uniike the Square Phillipe the rooms are not as spacious and the ceilings are low  However they have top of the line ameneties  i e  flat screen T V s a large hot tub and a stainless steel fridge just to name a couple of things  Le Square Philliipe although not in Old Montreal is in walking distance  Unlike the Embassy Suites the or is a la s The room is fairly sparse but spacious clean and very livable  This is important if you are staying in Monteal for a long time  Since the hotel is a reated warehouse from the s the building is well sound proofed  The pool which is located on the roof is beautifiul with a panoramic view  The continental breakfast is good but can attract large crowds  They serve Montreal bagelswhich are truly the best bagels on the planet The hotel does provide you with a breakfast tray so you can take the food up to your room if you wish  All your shopping can be done at the IGA around the corner  The grocery store closes at pm and is fairly pricey  In Montreal you can buy beer and wine in grocery stores  Depending on what youre looking for theres a Dollar store in the Eaton Center which is actually closer to than the IGA Not to be missed  the gourmet pizza restaurant right next to the hotel the one with the outdoor dining  Its fantasitic although the pies are small in door skating within a  minute walk from the hotel its very inexpensive beautiful and a great activity especially if it rains  renting bikes in old montreal  its fun for the entire family even if your kids cant ride bikes yet you can rent attachments for them as did we  renting quadrabikes in Old Montreal right on the bike path  We had a great time Bon vacances 
P => Excellent Hotel The hotel is in a very good location and has huge rooms with kitchens as mentioned by other people  The rooms were very quiet  The beds and linen are not the high quality of other hotels but are certainly adequate for a good nights sleep  Staff very helpful  
P => Great location huge room Really central in terms of accessing Montreal centre  Close to shops Old Montreal location for tourist bus etc  We stayed there at the end of y  and we our room was huge   more like an apartment No bar limited catering facilities there but our room came with kitchenette so i guess that they expect people to self cater largely  One massive bonus was the ent roof top swimming pool with a ked area outside which gives you an extra option to unwind at the end of the day  Lots of families there  
P => Great hotel great location This hotel is in a perfect location downtown  The room is HUGE and has a kitchen in it  The bed is fantastic first night of sleep in a week in the US All shops and sights are within walking distance Notre Dame Chinatown etc Indoor valet parking is  a day outdoorparking next door is   We opted for valet  
P => Great Choice We spent  nights there and everything was as expected  We had a ior double suite   double bed in an alcove living room with pull out sofa and kitchenette  The room was huge and gave room for a family of four to spread out  We made a number of requests extra pillows silence the barking dog next door and all were taken care of promptly and with a smile The continental breakfast was just ok   cereal croissants toast juice coffee  I was hoping for chocolate croissants It was busy and they were well staffed to clear dishes and replenish supplies The pool and exercise area were small but clean and well outfitted and there is a nice sun k with lounge chairs on the roof The location is ok near University of McGill and convenient to the Metro shopping and major portions of the underground city  But it was a good   minute walk to Old Montreal at a fast pace and there was not a great selection of better resaurants nearby It was a good location for a family   McDonalds Burger King Quiznos and food courts are very close as is an IMAX movie theatre  For a romantic getaway I think there are better choices location wise  
P => Excellent Choice for Montreal We stayed at Le Square Phillip after reading all the great reviews from tripadvisor  They could not have been more true  We had a quotiorquot king suite that was huge and very comfortable  The hotel is so clean I dont know how their staff keeps it that way with the size of the suites they have to take care of but they do  The breakfast was just right and the rooftop terrace had a great view of the city at night  We were completely satisfied with our stay  
P => Perfect for lone female travellers I went to visit a friend in Montreal and was let down at the last minute and needed to find somewhere to stay fast  As i was travelling from England tripadvisor was my best bet for advice  After reading other reviews of this hotel I ided to book and let me tell you believe the reviews I often travel alone and if youre female youll understand that sometimes the eating alone thing can attract the wrong sort of attention  The benefit of this hotel is you have your own kitchen so you at least have the choice of having some meals in your studio  The atmosphere is modern but relaxed there is a small gym and beautiful roof terrace also a laundry room and pool on the top floor  You have internet access in your room if you bring a laptop I didnt but quickly discovered the room next to reception where you can use the internet and print for free  You just need to tell reception and they will let you in  There are busy times when there is a wait list but ask reception to call your room once its free  The room I had a deluxe king studio and it was huge Everything you could need is there and of a really high standard  You can pay for movies or there are numerous tv channels though watch out for some of the tv movies which will appear on your final bill   minimal amount but I was unaware of this  Within your first few days go to St Catharine St Ouest turn right out of hotel its the main road running past The Bay department store and head a few blocks to the left where youll find a square with the tourist information centre and all the bus sightseeing tours  I took an open top double ker bus tour and it was so worth it you get to see the old port Notre Dame Basilica etc etc and you really get your bearings and see some fantastic architecture  I did this on my last day to kill some time before heading to the airport   do it sooner than I did I found Montreal to be a really pleasant place full of polite respectful people  Youll see quite a few homeless people and youll probably get asked for money but if you refuse youll just get an almost apologetic ok have a good day type response which surprised me  A nice change from central London where you really need your armour on day to day  Hope this helps 
P => Your home in Montr al I stayed at the Le Square Phillips with my family my wife and I have a teenager dhter twice during my three weeks holidays in Canada last y I selected this place after reading favourable reviews on this very website  As it is often the case I was not disappointed We arrived late on a Sunday night and we were welcomed by very friendly front desk staff  The property seems to me to be a reconverted office building  The re conversion was done with very great care and good taste  Our room was more a large one bedroom flat   with a fully equipped kitchen   than an hotel room  You feel that you have your own place in the second largest French speaking town in the worldThe attractions of the place are essentially three  LocationYou are really at the hearth of downtown Montr al  Everything and I mean everything is at walking distance  ServiceThe hotel is modelled upon the self catering apartment philosophy  But you have only the advantages of that i e  extremely ample rooms  Whatever you  need the competent professional and friendly staff is there to help you out  They do deserve full ks   Prestige of the buildingThe building is a very nice one at the hearth of the town  If you want to be perfectionist the choice of the furniture in the roms could have been more tasteful  In spite of that the overall result is outstanding  I particularly liked the gym and the pool at the top floor  The pool is to small to have a good swim but the kchairs in the terrace command a spectacular view of the skyscrapers of Montr al  Not to be missedI would list only two very minor negative points The breakfast room tends to be overcrowded and the food there is not what you would expect in such a nice property  This said it would be unfair to complain about that continental breakfast is included in the room rate   a pretty unusual feature in Canada where you are charged for every extra breath of fresh air We were granted a late check out at   pm during our second stay but the room maid knocked our door ten minutes before the term  We found that unnecessarily rude but this can be the personal initiative of a de motivated member of the staff and cannot change our very positive valuation of this property  
P => Great hotel We just got back and were very impressed with this hotel  We have  kids  amp  and the family suite was enormous  Huge rooms kitchen didnt use it but it was there friendly amp professional staff and no problems whatsoever  The rooftop k is nice and there is a workout room and pool Location is nice but we spent much of our time down in the old city so the walk was getting boring but it helped to work off the excellent meals that we had in some wonderful little restaurants We wouldnt hesitate to recommend it  
P => A great place for parents with small children My husband and I stayed at Le Square Phillips with our  year old son for  days this y  This hotel is SUPERB for families  Our very well appointed suite had a arate bedroom so that we could continue to enjoy our night after our little one was asleep  The room was beautiful very clean and peaceful  The FULL kitchen allowed us to eat in every night and a very good IGA grocery store nearby helped too  The enclosed roof top pool also allowed our son to work off some energy before bedtime  We swam while our laundry finished in the laundry room next door to the pool  The staff was attentive and helpful and the location is central  We rode the Metro all week and never needed to use a taxi except to get to and from the airport  Le Square Phillips made a wonderful basecamp for all of our Montreal explorations 
P => They Have a Rooftop Terrace Okay everyone loves this place  I was in for a convention and easy to walk to Palais de Congres  One thing no one ever mentions is that there is a wrap around rooftop k at this hotel  There are about  chaise lounges up there  Great place to look over the town and get some fresh airHotel staff is awesome  Place is as clean as a whistle  It is also a pleasure to have dogs around The rooms are huge and have free internet  Location was excellent Good restaurants French   Chez ien  block over if summerfall sit in the courtyard and Jardin Nelson for crepes  This restaurant is in old Montreal and is a bower of flowers  Have live jazz too  
P => Fantastic hotel in the heart of the city I read the reviews for this hotel and then ided to try it out  The reviews were right on the money  I would classify this hotel a  star but it is by far the best  star Ive ever stayed in The building is an old warehousefactory that has been totally reated and remodeled to turn it into a modern hotel  I loved the concrete pillars throughout the building and the use of lighting to accent them was very tasteful The staff was very helpful and professional  They were always ready to help and ready to go above and beyond what was asked of them I stayed in a family suite with  children and my wife and we found the unit to be quite spacious clean and tasteful  The kitchen was well supplied with basic utensilspotspansdishes  Bathroom was similarly equipped and very clean The beds and linens were of very good quality the kind you would find in a more luxurious hotel The HVAC system was also very good  No noisy cornerwall unit and there was attention to detail apparent with the installation of air deflectors under the curtains  Thsi effectively eliminates that annoying curtain flapping that occurs in many other hotels Our rate included a contiental breakfast in the breakfast room on the second floor  An excellent experience  All food was well stocked and I really liked the Montr al style bagels   a real treat The poolexercise roomterrace was adequate and very well maintained  These facilities cannot handle large crowds but we never had such a problem  Also the laundry facilities on site were great The location of the hotel is fantasitc  Within walking distance of the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth and other high end hotels  Also close by are Ste Cathrine St  McGill University Percival Molson Stadium Vieux Port de Montr al restaurants galore shopping and the list goes on The only thing that I can think of that I didnt like about this hotel was that there wasnt much of a view from any vantage point I could see  But I guess when youre in a  storey building surrounded by taller ones what do you expectOverall for downtown Montr al and for what we experienced I was very happy with this hotel and would go back and would recommend it to anyone who asks Well done 
P => Great stay at Le Square Phillips We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Le Square Phillips  The hotel is in central downtown   about  mins walk down to Old Montreal  Our room was clean and huge   with a kitchen dining table and chairs and a comfortable king size bed  We enjoyed the complimentary breakfasts which were simple but tasty and filling  On one morning our toliet blocked up but this was quickly fixed once we brought it to the attention of reception Old Montreal where we spent most of our time is a  min walk away with Place Jacques Cartier a cool square with plenty of great restaurants a further  mins  The big shopping malls and dept stores on the other hand are only a couple of mins away   as are several metro stops  This is a great hotel   one we would happily recommend to anyone  
P => What a pleasant surprise I booked the hotel based on the positive reviews  I am a seasoned traveler and usually steer clear of hotels that arent of large chains Boy have I been wrong This hotel was so very pleasant  Check in by friendly attractive young ladies  The conciergevalet immediately greeted us took our car and then brought our bags up to meet us  The room was huge immaculate and well designed  The hotel is very cool  Perfect for a fun romantic weekend or an extended stay  The bathroom was big and clean  The windows are floor to ceiling with  foot high ceilings I am very impressed by this hotel and will return  
P => be best hotel ever Great hotel in a great location  Rooms are large well appointed and pristine  Family suites are really big and comfortable  Had everything we could possibly need  Love the modern design in what is an old structure  Very well done  Super staff everywhere all more than willing to help no matter what the need  Great terrace poolexercise room and laundry room  Location could not have been any better  Valet parking works great  Great place will go there again     
P => Very good choice We stayed at the hotel with our two kids and had a very enjoyable stay  We chose a basic room with two double beds but it was very spacous and clean  The kitchendining area had a stove microwave and full size refrigerator and plenty of room to cook a regular meal  The staff were courteous and helpful  Although there is a parking lot behind the hotel cars did not seem to stay there overnight so it is necessary to use the valet parking however we did not need to wait more than a few minutes for the car each time we needed it  We had a deal through the Montreal tourism website which gave us   off the third nights stay  This went through very easily at the hotel  The location was very central and close to many interesting places in the city  Overall I would strongly recommend this hotel for families  
P => Fabulous weekend at Le Square Phillips We stayed for a three day weekend at the Le Square Phillips  We got a special three day package through a Montreal tourism special  The hotel was absolutely fabulous  The King studio was large with a small kitchen area and a table to eat at  The bathroom was clean and had a ble sink  The staff were unusually accommodating  The consiege helped us get to the International fireworks on time when we ided to go last minute  Our weekend was wonderful and staying at this hotel helped make it so  I would definitely stay again  Only negative was poor water pressure in the showers and the towels could have been softer  Very mild criticism of a great experience  
P => High praise for Le Square Phillips My family stayed here for an over night trip to Montreal and we were pleasantly surprised by our stay at this hotel  The price was reasonable under  and it was in an ideal location  The only very minor drawback was that we had to wait a while for valet parking and we were warned by the local parking attendant to beware of leaving valuables in the car  We were able to walk to St  Catherine in about a minute to the heart of Jazz Festival in  minutes and to Chinatown in less than  minutes  Check in was easy and the desk staff was very courteous  We got a suite on the th floor with a kitchendining area and two double beds  The kitchen was fully stocked with dishwasher stove microwave and fridge  There was seating for four at the table  The ceilings were very high and there were large windows that brought in a lot of light  It was much bigger than all of the five star hotels I have stayed at  Free breakfast and internet access were big pluses  There was also a roof k with a pool workout room and laundry facilities  Would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Montreal 
P => Large Rooms Downtown Our room was the largest hotel room that I have ever seen  Large comfortable king bed sink refrigerator microwave dishwasher and a stylish column  The room had style comfort and size  Located on a quiet side street in downtown Montreal the hotel is within walking distance of shopping metro stations and old town  The hotel property was clean and the staff extraordinally helpful  
P => Best hotel on our trip My family of six stayed for three nights at Le Square Phillips during e   We reserved a family suite room with the Sweet Deal ala Montreal rate of  for the first two nights and   for the third  As stated by other reviews the room was enormous with high ceilings and was spotless  King bedroom queen bed in an alcove and a queen sofa bed along with two TVs a full kitchen and a large bathroom  Room is well insulated as we never heard anyone else in hallways or other rooms during our stay  arate ac units in the bedroom and living room allowed different temperatures if necessary Being a smaller hotel the staff was outstanding  There was no wait at all for check in and the valetconcierge was very helpful with recommendations and locations  Parking is  per day but unlike some other hotels they were able to handle the size of our minivan  Daily housemaid service even loaded and ran the dishwasher for us Location is excellent within walking distance of most attractions and within a few blocks of the metro for those farther visits  The kids enjoyed the pool and although it is small in comparison to other hotels they had it to themselves so no complaining  Breakfast was good continental fare with plenty of seating area  Overall an excellent hotel experience and highly recommended 
P => Definitely one of the best hotels ive been to    I stayed at this hotel based on the trusted Tripadvisor reviews and ratings  This hotel was extremely clean and very contemporary  Rooms were loft like and had a mini kitchen with stove fridge   etc  Hotel staff was friendly too  One negative was that parking fees were mistakenly added to my bill which was easily corrected there are metered parking spots right in front and across the street from the hotel  definitely stay here again  
P => The Best Listen there isnt much more to say  It is simply the best place to stay in Montreal  Ive stayed here a few times in the past  but this was the first time my boyfriend stayed here  I loved the look on his face when he saw our room  He thought for sure they made an error because it was so big and beautiful  A erate bedroom full kitchen two TVs  FantasticYou are close to everything Its quiet  The rooms are huge The staff ever so nice  The breakfast is not the best ever but it has all the standards cereal juice toast muffins fresh fruit and it is clean which is most important  The view off the roof top is great as well  Stay here 
P => Lives up to expectations Just returned from a  night stay at this hotel and can affirm all the previous great reviews  It is in a great location right in the city centre but still remains quiet enough to give you peace  The building is in an excellent state of repair everything works and the whole place is spotlessly clean  We took a ior suite which was the most enormous hotel room I have ever had   televisions fridge cooker dining table sofa enormous bed fantastic bathroom storage room the list goes on simply huge  The staff were pleasant and cheerful at all times and extremely attentive  The free breakfast was really good and also well managed with staff in attendance at all times  This was my first visit to Montreal and now it is one of my favourite cities  A wonderfully clean and fresh city where even the street dwellers were pleasant  On any trip you get the views for free I like to have a good base to return to and this could not have been better  Do not worry about missing the breakfast either it is situated next to a host of coffee shops and little street cafes  Lunch and dinner are also well catered for in the vicinity Try McLeans on Rue Peel for great for great pub meals and atmosphere  If you want to stay in Montreal you will find this hotel difficult to beat for value  Well worth its excellent ratings  
P => Very good value This hotel offers exceptional facilities for a mid range hotel  My husband stayed for  nights which was part businesspart holiday  I joined him for  nights  The room was ideal for us as it was huge  The kitchen was very useful to make snacks drinks etc  The view out of our window was pretty boring but it was very quiet  The air conheating was the best I have ever come across  While we were there the outside temperature varied from just above freezing to a very sticky  but our room just stayed a perfect temperature  It was also silent I hate being woken up in the night by the aircon kicking inThe breakfast was pretty good although perhaps could have a little bit more variety  For anyone staying for just a few days Im sure it wouldnt be a problem I enjoyed having a swim before breakfast  The pool and pool area is pleasant but the pool is really narrow two swimmers and its full  My only negative about this hotel was the condition of the pool water  After the first few days we both noticed that our skin was dry and itchy  I thought it might be the pool but I wasnt sure and as I really like to have a swim I continued to use the pool  On the last day I noticed that the water was really cloudy and since Ive come home I have re washed our swimwear several times and it still stinks of chemicals  
P => Friendly Staff and Perfect Location My husband two elementary age dhters and I stayed at this hotel in late il   We were impressed by the friendliness of the staff and happy to be in such a good location  right in the middle of everything yet on a quiet side street  The room was clean very quiet and well stocked with plates and utensils along with the usual coffee pot and hair dryer  The continental breakfast buffet though unchanging from day to today was hearty and healthful with good coffee too  The bed in the hide a bed sofa was ironically more comfortable than our bed though  Our bed was hard and unforgiving Im afraid  The room was stylishly orated but somewhat austere  perhaps because the ceilings are so high and the carpet so thin  If you like that look then this is the place for you  It was a nice room just not my kind of look and feel because it was not warm and homey which can be important in a cold city like Montreal  The pool as other reviewers have noted is tiny  The water at least during our visit also had a moldy smell that did not come out of my dhters bathing suit until we had washed it three times  I will say however that she enjoyed the pool all the same  and the rooftop view was lovely  Overall I would stay here again  The price and convenience   not to mention the clean quiet rooms and halls and especially the truly kind and thoughtful staff  make it a top choice for a stay in downtown Montreal  
P => Amazing family hotel This hotel was simply amazing  We went to Montreal for the Mothers day weekend  There were eight of us in total and it was tough to finda ent hotel last minute  We came across this hotel from tripadvisor and found we could have a family suite that would accomodate all of us together  Great For a total of  CAD a night that was cheaper than any other place we could have all stayed at I was totally amazed to find that not only did our family suite have two huge bedrooms it also had an enormous family room dining area and complete kitchen that was fully equipped complete with stove fridgemicrowave and even a dishwasher  Oh la la A continental breakfast was also included and was very ent  They had a selection of cereals juices bagels bread muffins and slices of cake aswell as Nabob coffee and tea The indoor rooftop pool was great fun for the kids  The staff were exceptionally friendly The hotel is very conveniently located a short walk from the quothappening areaquot yet the actual road the hotel is on is very quite  Just perfect  Wouldnt want to stay anywhere else on my next visit 
P => The absolute best I found Le Square Phillips through TripAdvisor and it remains the nicest hotel Ive ever stayed at  We booked the room for New Years Eve in  and for four people was a great value and incredibly roomy with a wonderful location  The staff were young and professional the hotels appearance was clean and well kept with a fully stocked kitchen and dishwasher if I remember correctly and the room was more spacious than our home  I would definitely recommend Le Square Phillips to anyone staying in Montreal  
P => Exellent service great location great price My husband and I stayed at the Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites this past weekend   and we were extremely happy with our choice  I initially heard about this hotel through tripadvisor which had rated it    and boy are they on the k  The rooms are very spacious neat neat neat close to everything great service all this for a great price  We will definitely stay there in the future  If I had to pick something negative I guess be the free breakfast  Perhaps more fruit and cheese  But I guess beggars cant be choosers  Overall we loved itSincerelyA very happy customer 
P => Nice Hootel with large rooms We stayed at the Square Philips for  nights at the end of ch  This Hotel was lovely with very large rooms all spotlessly clean The inclusive continental breakfast was delicious with lots of cakes and pastries and as much toast as you could eat  The ladies in the breakfast room filled up the shelves constantly so no one went without The pool was quite small fine for a couple of swimmers but we had  kids which I am sure put off anyone else who might have wanted to use the pool Car parking was  per night  tax a bit steep but normal for a big city and your car is actually parked inside the building  The fitness area was quite small and very hot if you were mad enough to try the running machine like me  The one thing that some people might be put off by was that the back of the Hotel overlooks a car park and in the corner of the car park is a little settlement of homeless people living in tents   This didnt bother us and it provided hours of entertainment for the kids quotTramp watchingquot as they put it  They invited all their friends in to watch and we got a running commentary of what was going on We loved the Hotel but were not that impressed with Montreal  The underground shopping centre was good but there wasnt much else to see  The most interesting part we found was the old port  There are a lot of run down areas and when you come from the airport the view is a bit dismal with graffiti everywhere  
P => Great Home Away From Home I recently stayed at this hotel and it was a great home away from home  As a first timer visiting Montreal I wanted to stay in a hotel with good access to shopping transporation and some activities  Clearly this is the place to stay  In walking distance there is plenty of shopping metro access a tourist center museums grocery store plenty of coffee shops and only  blocks from the House of Jazz  The hotel staff were the greatest  Always available and willing to assist  My room was more than I had hoped for and the king sized bed was very comfortable  I would stay here again for sure  
P => The Perfect Hotel in Montreal We stayed one night here this past weekend  I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel The check in was quick and friendly  They even upgraded us from a ior suite to a full suite  The room itself was huge clean and modern  The location is perfect a couple of blocks from all the shopping you can handle Eaton Centre Simons and at least  other malls  And all that for such a low price   incredible Next time I am in Montreal Im definitely staying here again  Loved it  
P => Great Hotel This building has been fantastically converted into studiossuites  We only had a studio which was brilliant can t imagine how the suite could have bettered what we had  The kitchen had everything cooker microwave dishwasher and fridge freezer  Bathroom was a good size and again had everything you need including good quality toiletries  Hotel also has a good gym and swimming pool and excellent laundry facilities if you need them  The complimentary breakfast each morning was also very good and had an excellent choice  The parking in the hotel was secure and reasonably priced  The location was pretty central and had easy access to the underground city  Would definitely stay here again  
P => Great concept great value Great concept great value thoroughly ent  Stayed in a studio king room   had considered the Omni or Sofitel but chose Le Square P based on the size of the room kitchen in room   the Sofitel bargain rate looked miniscule by comparison  Location right off the main shopping street St  Catherine tons of people out and a lot of activity  A lot of nearby quick food locations   vegetarians note Le Commensal a vegetarian buffet is a block or two down St  Catherine and definitely worth a stop for lunch  Loads of coffee places Second Cup Tim Hortons Starbucks not too far Cafe Van Houtte  Can easily walk from the hotel to Old Montreal Old Port Notredame Museums and Mount Royal Caveats minor pack your own lotion no sample size in bathroom   carried on luggage and was trying to avoid liquids breakfast ent nice since was included but not elaborate bread some muffins cereal   all carbs no yogurt fruit salad room was near elevator could hear people getting on and off at night and talking in the hallway Must try Maple latte at Canadian Maple Delights in Old Montreal  Also recommend the maple shortbread cookie w maple icing Overall would stay at Le Square P again good location for a first trip to the city although for a second trip to Montreal would likely just stay in the Old Montreal section  
P => Wonderful hotel I just came back from a weekend in Montreal  I live in Burlington VT so Montreal is a nice weekend excursion  I was very very impressed with Le Square Phillips Check in went very smooth and we were amzed when we saw our room  I was a little worried that there had been a mistake and we were given a suite instead of the standard room that I had reserved  But there was no mistake   the rooms are just that big  And it was very clean and quite nice I am a little confused by the earlier comment stating that there is only a Burger King nearby  Yes there is a Burger King near the hotel but there are some other restaurants right there and if you walk a few blocks on St  Catherines there are tons of restaurants  The hotle is very centrally located with St  Catherines Street literally a block away  The Eaton Center is about three blocks away  Anyone not afraid to walk a couple blocks would LOVE the location of thins hotel  And the metro is right at the Eaton Center so if you cant or dont want to walk you can take that all around the city  
P => Great Business Hotel We picked this hotel based on other previous reports  We just got back from staying at this hotel and the previous trip reports give correct and accurate information on this very good hotel  If you are looking for a very nice apartment hotel this hotel is for you  The pictures on their website are accurate  Very clean nice accommodations and friendly helpful staff  Guests include families and business people  The lap pool was nice for an early morning swim  It is not a pool for small children  The work out room is clean and the equipment is newer and in good condition  The outside terrace has beautiful views  It should be so nice in the warm weather  The included breakfast is perfect for getting started before a day of touring the city  Bring your tray from your room if you want to bring back bagels juice cereal and fruit to eat in your own kitchen  Around the corner on Ste Catherine is a large pharmacy that has soda and snacks they are open till  or  pm  Ste Catherine is a little seedy but safe  We went to the Atwater ket a short metro ride away and bought cheeses foie gras banquettes and some pastries  We went across the street outside Atwater ket and bought wine at the government controlled liquor store SAQ  There is also a very large grocery store next to the liquor store  We brought our snacks home and had a great feast  And since we had a full size kitchen we could savor our snacks for later  Just steps from the hotel there is a wood burning oven pizza restaurant across from the Phillip Square and we had pizza leftovers in our room while watching a movie  There is a wonderful bistro on the same block as the hotel at  Phillips Square Le Grqand Comptoir and we ate there twice  This hotel is in the business district but a short cab ride to anywhere cabs are always available  The two metro stops are a very short walk from the hotel the staff can give you directions  Our bed was firm but comfortable the sheets are not luxurious and very thin  The shower is just ok but the bathroom is very nice  The hotel is very quiet  This hotel is an excellent value 
P => Our favorite hotel in the world Weve now stayed at the Square Phillips three times and loved it each time  The suites are huge and give our family of four plenty of room to spread out  The location right in the center of Montreal is perfect as well  We returned to Montreal as much because we knew wed have a great hotel as for the local attractions  Right now this is clearly our favorite hotel     of any in the world  
P => Great hotel and a great price located in the heart of Montreal Was in town for a hockey game and booked this hotel because of Tripadvisor  Hotel is easy to find via car  Check in was a snap  The hallways are very large and very modern  We booked a room with  double beds as it was two couples in this room  It was one large room with  full beds there was a table to eat and kitchen with a full refrigerator stove etc  Room was very clean and had huge windows with lots of light coming in  Parking was extra and its valet service  Hotel is in the middle of everything there are a lot of stores just a block away  You can walk to the Bell Centre its about a  minute walk  Very close  I would definitely stay here again when in Montreal  
P => Deserves its number one rating Booked it last week on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed  Rooms are large clean and modern and the location is unbeatable  Excellent value for those visiting a great city  
P => The perfect hotel concept Ive stayed at this hotel a few times over the past year and I just wish every hotel were like the Square Phillips No wonder its the   rated hotel in Montreal not to mention the biggest bargainOn my last visit I had booked a studio suite as I usually do  Ive only ever stayed in room  however it was not available this time and I was given room  instead  However when I walked into my room I noticed that it was different  I then realized that I had been upgraded to a ior suite It was HUGE just under  square feet  I could actually run around the room it was that bigBeds are a little firm but I had no problems sleeping  Bed linens were of suprisingly good quality VERY soft and definitely not cheap and better quality than that of pretty well anywhere Ive ever stayedMy room had a sleeping alcove with a double bed and a TV which was a nice touch since Im used to staying in studios I only stayed  night yet I did use the full kitchencookware provided to make my dinner that night and the dishwasher is a great touch Local calls except for  numbers and high speed internet hard wired are free Service at front desk was excellent and very helpful The free continental breakfast is a nice touch and you can take it back to your room if you want to eat it in private There is a little pool and exercise room on the roof level I never expected so much for   CAD per nightThis is truly the best bargain in Montreal so before you book the Sheraton or Queen Elizabeth you should check this place out first 
P => Perfect Location My husband and I stayed at LSP at the beginning of our five day trip to Quebec to celebrate  years together  We are in our late twentiesearly thirties and enjoy vacations that are packed with adventure and relaxation We chose LSP mainly because of the location bargain price and all of the positive reviews on Tripadvisor  This hotel definitely stands up to its reputation  The rooms are clean and large  The eat in fully equipped kitchen is perfect for having snacks breakfast or even cooking for people that want to stay longer or have finicky kids  The valet service is expensive per day but in relation to the price of regular parking and the convenience of having your car quickly I would definitely recommend using their service  Dont forget to tipThe location of this hotel cannot be better Shopping is so close on Rue St  Catherine and a lot of fine restaurants surround you  Old Montreal is also in walking distance min but the subway system cabs or buses could also take you there promptly If you are interested in coming here for a bachelorbachelorette party weekend  The bars are close and the suites are perfect for larger groups The final note is the staff  Every day we would ask them questions regarding the best restaurants stores attractions and they would give us great information  We will definitely spread the word about this gem  
P => Amazing We stayed at Le Square Phllips for  nights after reading such great reviews on trip advisor and we were definitely impressed The staff was outstanding very helpful and polite  Whenever we needed directions or asked for suggestions of things to check out they were there to give us suggestions directions and map it out for us  Our room was HUGE much more than we were expecting even from seeing pictures on trip advisor and the hotel website  We couldnt have been happier with the room very big clean and just a nice space  The kitchen area had a fridge stove dishwasher and microwave as well as tons of plates utensils etc  For a longer stay this would be perfect The hotel itself is in a great location no more than a  minute walk to the Eaton Centre and a movie theatre  Approximately     minute walk to Old Montreal and subway stops near by as well Breakfast was much more than we had expected   cereal bagels bread fruit croissants muffins etc  The breakfast room was very nice too lots of room and it was never very busy either  The pool area was nice and although it was never busy the pool was quite small and with more people would be too busy  The view from the pool area was great and in warmer weather would be beautiful to sit up there  We didnt use the gym area but it didnt have too much to do their either  Overall I would absoloutely reccommend a stay here We would definitely stay here again when we visit Montreal again and have already recommended it to friends  Definitely deserving of its   status on tripadvisor 
P => Great Stay We stayed at Le Square Phillips for  nights in mid ruary  Our family of  adults and  teens stayed in a studio suite  I was worried that it might get cramped but it was very large and comfortable  The suite was immaculately clean very quiet and our tenth floor view was very nice We took one trip to the pool on the roof and we enjoyed it because we had it to ourselves  If others had been there we might have felt cramped as it is very small  There is a walk out terrace with railing around the outside of the roof which affords a fabulous view of Montreal We were impressed with the continental breakfast on the first day but the bread and cereal were getting a bit tired by day   If we had stayed longer we  have chosen to make our own meal in the room The valet parking was indeed day which is steep but the valets retrieved our car in mere seconds every time we requested it  They were awesome Also the cars are parked inside the hotel second floor in a secured warm area   niceThe location of the hotel could not be more convenient  It is one block from the underground city the weather was freezing so this was perfect and one block from Rue St  Catherine with an abundance of shopping and restaurants  We definitely plan to return to Montreal and Le Square Phillips when its warmer so we can take in all the sites and the open air restaurants  
P => A little bit of heaven on earth     I was a guest presenter at the American Association for Applied Linguistics conference last e which was being held at the Hyatt Regency Montreal  After reading numerous negative reviews regarding the Hyatt I started searching for an alternative  The first thing that jumped out at me was the number of glowing reviews for Le Square Phillips which was conveniently located next to my conference  After seeing that it won a TripAdvisor award I booked a deluxe studio  When I arrived at the hotel near sunset the area looked a little questionable  Indeed two streets over there were homeless panhandlers but if you stick to areas with lots of pedestrian traffic its fine  Its about a  minute walk down to the Vieux Port Old Port which is a fairly straight shot from the hotel  If you need directions or restaurant suggestions just ask the superb staff theyll be more than happy to help Reception was friendly and helpful  If you dont speak French its not a problem young Quebecois are fluently bilingual  When we opened the door to our room I couldnt believe the sheer size of it  Most impressively as my roommate is a serious clean freak it was  spotless   As in no crumbs in the toaster no crumbs in the silverware drawer no water spots on the dishes The room was quiet and very comfortable and the full kitchen meant that we could save money by eating in room which we did in true Montreal style fresh baguettes daily French wine French jams brie and espresso courtesy of the grocery store located a few blocks away about  minutes one way on foot  There is a small deli attached to the hotel but it was always empty even at peak times which made me hesitant to eat there  When I arrived at the Hyatt to register for my conference it made me doubly glad that Id chosen the Square Phillips  The Hyatt was outdated and under major construction the rooms much more expensive and very dark and cramped  The conference itself was very poorly managed by the Hyatt but I was able to retreat to the Square Phillips for some much needed rest and relaxation at the end of the day I didnt take advantage of the pool or exercise facilities but it was nice to have them available the hotel also has a laundromat  The high speed internet wasnt as much of a success most of the time I fought to get it to work but it could have been my computer  The next time I visit Montreal for work or pleasure the Square Phillips is the only hotel pour moi 
P => Great despite lost luggage After spending  months planning this trip we finally got to stay in Le Square Philips and it was fantastic I cannot agree enough with every review the place has had the breakfast in the morning was lovely i stuffed myself with all the bread i could Our luggage was delayed at Heathrow for  days which put a dampner on the trip unfortuantly I only got to see the inside of the Gap in the Eaton centre We did drive around the city a bit and the valet parking was very handy So definitly stay there there was three of us which mad the room really good value about  each a night great 
P => Great Location  This is a great value and great location Hotel in Montreal  My family six adults enjoyed a few nights there in mid  and all was very good  This is not a  star hotel with all of the  star trimmings but rooms are large very well equipped and very clean  We had two rooms  There is a great indoor pool and shopping for self catering is nearby as is downtown  short blocks and the metro  Staff are very helpful and friendly  
P => Rooms were excellent and super super clean I just got back this weekend from a two night stay here with  friends  This hotel was excellent  The room was impeccable and the services were quick  Like others said though parking is  per night per car and i had two cars ugh  Also they hit you up with all kinds of canada taxes  WARNING I booked thru Hotels com for the rate of  CAD per nite and at checkout i look and the bill is  CAD per nite  Now the front desk was super nice about helping me out with this problem in the end he finally said he could do the special weekend rate for me    CAD per night  
P => Perfect for travelling with small children We travel to Montreal a few times a year with our young children  Weve been searching for the perfect place a good location a room with a arate bedroom and a pool  We finally found it The or is new contemporary and clean  The kitchen was huge and well stocked with dishes silverware glasses etc  The staff was extremely helpful and prompt  The pool on the top floor gave a great view of the city  And the location couldnt be better  We walked to Old Town to see an Imax went ice skating had lunch in China town and shopped on St  Catherine  It was a perfect weekend  We were all happy and we have already made reservations to come back in il to stay there again  
P => Great hotel Cant beat the pool on the roof Be aware though taxes and parking will greatly increase your bill  Our  nights for  became  with these charges  Still worth it  And dont miss Le Grande Comptoir cafe just down a block  Great French food 
P => New Years  in Montreal We stayed at the Square Phillips for New Years Eve  after reading great reviews on TripAdvisor  The price was excellent under  a night for a huge clean suite with a full kitchen The hotel is conviently located near Rue St  Catherine and the metro  Its walking distance from Old Montreal  The staff were very helpful  The rooms were equipped with free wired internet you need a cable that you can get at the front desk  Simon the concierge recommended two great restaurants Da Emma Italian and Chez Queux French  Theres a small gym a few machines and weights and a lap pool on the roof  All in all a great value for the money  
P => Its as good as they say I stayed there on two arate occasions in ember  Overall a terrific experience and great value for the money having paid around  for a studio  Rooms are very comfortable and stylish for an all suite type of hotel they make the buildings columns a feature  The ceilings are high  Kitchen is really well stocked  Thermostat control system works well  Breakfast is basic and a bit depressing commercial breadloaves and muffins but OK  Staff overall was very warm and helpful with one exception at main desk who bordered on sarcastic  Also I ended up initially billed for a higher rate for the second stay without having been informed at the time of reservation at front desk  This ended up being resolved in my favor with apologies once I had left  All in all this place truly deserves its top rating  
P => A large one bedroom apartment at a hotel price My friends and I stayed at the Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites for my bachelor party back in ust  We chose the hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor its spacious rooms and its proximity to all  There were six of us and we got two deluxe ior suites that could have held another one or two in each room comfortably  The rooms were bigger than one bedroom apartments with a large bathroom furnished kitchen area walk in closet space and a very large bedroom  There was ample room for us to play poker while enjoying a bite to eat  And there was free internet access in the room something most hotels like to charge  for each night The hotel was perfectly located within   mins walking distance of the nice restaurants and lounges in the old town and the bars and night scene along St  Catherines  The hotel is situated just off of St  Catherines where most of the shops begin The staff was very courteous from the front desk to the valet  I would highly recommend this hotel for even families or groups of friends  In fact were planning on staying there again for when we go to Montreal again for my friends bachelor party later in the year  
P => Great family trip for the christmas holiday Awesome We picked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and everything we read was true  We spent  nights in a quotFamily Suitequot room and had a wonderful time  Here are the highlightsgt The quotroomquot was essentially a ent size apartment with an entry area and closet two spacious bedrooms one bathroom a full kitchen with a large refrigerator and dishwasher a dining area with a large table and a sitting area with TV and desk  gt Everything was immaculately clean  The cleaning staff was unobtrusive and professional gt The stylish modern or is a refreshing change from the quotstandardquot hotel look  gt Perfect location with easy access to extensive shopping and restaurants the Metro Mont Royal Old Montreal McGill University etc  gt Front Desk staff and Concierge were energetic and helpful in all respects  Their recommendations and services were excellent gtIncluded continental breakfast was very good and the dining area is nice  gt The attached Italian restaurant was tasty and friendly This was a great find  Thanks Trip Advisor 
P => It was the best Stayed at Le Square Phillips over Christmas vacation  We  adults and  teenage boys booked a family suite and were absolutely blown away at the size and cleanliness of our room  Spacious accomodations high ceilings a full size kitchen huge bathroom with lovely soaking tub  Very friendly and helpful staff   each time we stepped in the lobby we were asked how everything was going and if we needed assistance  The rooftop pool while a bit chilly on a snowy night was tolerable and extremely clean  Great to go for a swim and look at the city lights  Location was great   very close to the McGill Metro stop and underground city  Underground parking was   per day extra but worth every penny  Our vehicle was brought curbside within minutes  Free continental breakfast each morning included fresh delicious croissants lemon or chocolate ble pound cake a variety of cereals fresh juices and fruits coffee and toast  Really a first class stay at a very affordable price  
P => Great hotel great city Stayed here in ember  Perfect location in Downtown Montreal which is a truly wonderful city  All the previous reviews are perfectly accurate  The location is so convenient staff were extremely helpful with any request or questions we had for them  As in the other review the perfect Italian restaurant is right in the lobby and the owners cant recall their names were a treasure to visit  My only gripe with the hotel was the lack of a wireless internet option for the room  The connection itself was perfect so only if you are as lazy for me and like to surf while lying on bed should that matter  I can easily recommend this great hotel 
P => Loved Le Square Phillips great hotel excellent location excellent service the rooms are huge and very clean staff were very friendly and competent  Eat at the attached Italian Restaurant ask for Valerie who makes the best cannoli in the world   or just ask for anythig she makes underground mall is  short blocks away  c and Stephanie NJ 
P => A Great Escape My husband and I stayed at Le Square Phillips for three nights  We stayed in a Studio Suite and it was fabulous  The hotel is one block away from St  Catherines Street which is the shopping dining and entertainment district  The location cant be beat The continental breakfast is a perfect way to start the day  They have bagels toast muffins a variety of cereals juices and fruit  The hotel is extremely quiet  We never heard anybody in the hallways upstairs or downstairs  The soundproofing is great The small restaurant located off the lobby has great Italian food If you are lucky enough to take in a Montreal Canadiens game like we were its only about six blocks away We would definitely stay here again 
P => Lived up to the high ratings My wife and I stayed at Le Square Phillips for  days near the end of ember and enjoyed it very much  This was our first trip to Montreal and picked this hotel because of all the great reviews posted here  It lived up to the rave reviews our room was great and the service was great  I have no complaints  The concierge was very helpful recommending restaurants setting up dinner reservations city tour and even getting hockey tickets  We would recommend staying here especially for the price location and value  
P => reviews did not lie Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites is an excellet hotel and a great value in Montreal  staff is very friendly and helpful  cab anywhere   they arrive at the hotel in a couple of minutes  best view I have seen from a hotel fitness center  Zia has the best Canolees anywhere  Bejing cafe in chinatown has the best eggrolls anywhere including NYC and China  Montreal is a shoppers paradise  easy tax refund at the airport  St  Patricks around the corner has a great Sunday mass  no crowds and friendly people   perfect blend of Europe and the US   we are definietly returning soon   less than an hour flight from Newark NJ 
P => dont forget to try the little Franch restaurant down the street Previous reviewers mentioned the pizza or Italian restaurant near the Square Phillips hotel but for our money the real gem was the little French restaurant Le Grand Comptoir just a few doors down  Voted quotBest inexpensive French restaurantquot its exactly what we needed an old fashioned authentic and very affordable bistro just a few steps from our hotel  We ate there every day and were never disapointed  Daily specials from   to   lots of classic dishes like Cassoulet everything very homey and delicious good service  Atmosphere and or are nothing special but thats not what you go for  Try to get a seat up by the window so you can watch the goings on in the Square P S  dont waste your money on a metro pass  There are hundreds of taxis plying the streets and most sites are only about a   cab ride away  Its cheaper than taking the subway and more convenient We agree with everyone who has raved about the hotel  Their comments are right on target spacious rooms clean very reasonable price for what you are getting nice rooftop pool ent breakfast centralized location good service  Not a single complaint  Not one 
P => fab fab fab Better than expected Sometimes the pictures a hotel provides are nothing like what you end up getting but at this hotel the pictures dont serve it justice because of the spacious rooms huge  foot ceilings The pool rather than being stuffed in the basement is up high with windows bright and an interesting view  Also a great little breakfast room with plenty of choice inlcuding real montreal bagels  Front desk was very kind and friendly and its a great location esspecially for a first trip to Montreal  Loved it 
P => Many pluses a few relatively minor problems This hotel is certainly good value for the price but a few problems mean Im unable to give it an quotExcellentquot rating  Even the basic rooms are spacious and the appliances microwave oven and dishwasher in my room were new and sparkling clean  The cleaners did a good job and their service includes a place setting on the dining table  Pillows were very hard and I was supplied with softer pillows upon request  My only complaints were waiting  minutes in line to check in and being unable to cool the room below  C  F the first  hours  You see only the heat was working at this time of the year    no AC which I would have used for  minutes to cool the room to  F  A nice advanced digital thermostat is of little use when all you can do is make the room hotter or send in quotneutralquot air that only cools it down very very gradually  
P => Very pleased with the Square Phillips We were very pleased with this suite hotel which is very centrally located in downtown Montreal  The suites are spacious and comfortable with refrigerators and cooking facilities  The hotel does not have a restaurant or room service however there are many places within a short walking distance  We particularly liked quotChez Ericquot which is a short distance from the hotel at  Union  
P => Great location Booked two nights here for myself husband and our two adult children  The suite was huge with two double beds kitchen area and excellent bathroom  All impeccably clean  The receptionist was very friendly and efficient amp the concierge also excellent  We didnt use the pool and gym we just didnt find time but good to know theyre there likewise free internet access  Great location just off Rue St Catherine and within walking distance of shops and restaurants as well as Vieux Montreal  Good value for money as it cost Can  for the four of us per night  
P => Perfectly Located Super Clean Fab Concierges Spent one night in Montreal as a mini side trip en route to Ottawa  I was torn between Le Sq Ph and Hotel XIX  The goal was to find a highly rated TripAdvisor hotel in a good location costing  max  We hit the jackpot Le Sq Ph is all that and more Prime location It is one block from Catherine St and its a fun bustling few blocks away from Cresecent Super Clean The rooms are super clean   all areas of it  The kitchen area is fully equipped and well maintained  We ended up using the kitchen to make a great breakfast of leftovers from a fab but very pricey steak dinner at Queue de Cheval and the breakfast buffet where there were no issues with our taking items to bring to our room Fab Concierge We interacted with  concierges and each of them were amazing  They each were genuinely nice and extremely helpful Hotel XIX looks nice amp cozy online and is in Old Montreal but I dont think the location of St Sq Ph can be beat  Old Montreal is lovely and quaint but being closer to the heart of downtown is much nicer since it is close to all the shops bars etc  If you are looking for a more low key vibe then Hotel XIX might be the better pick  Regardless Downtown to Old Montreal is within walking distance  We parked the car and didnt move it its a great walkable city Jardin Nelson is a great outdoor dining experience  Theres live music in the back and there are huge heaters over each table since it is now chilly Finally a must do is the barrestaurant at the top of Place Villa ie  OMG  Best view ever If possible go early evening and catch the sun setting  it is breathtaking  
P => A nice Surprise My family just spent one night visiting Montreal and took your suggestion about this hotel  Everything lived up to what was promisedIve driven into Montreal a few times and this hotel was very easy to reach  The friendly staff parked our car and greeted us in a professional manner  The room was very clean quiet and spacious  The lighting in the room was excellent Their is a very nice exercise pool and exercise room on the top floor with a wonderful view of the city The hotel is in a nice location one block away from St  Catherine St  and a  minute walk to McGill  There are numerous great restaurants within a nice  minute walkWe would definetly stay here again on our next rip to Montreal 
P => Basic but upscale at the same time This is the second time weve stayed here and it has once again lived up to our expectations  You will find clean spacious comfortable rooms in a superb location of the city at an excellent value  Each room has a small kitchen that is modern with excellent appointments  We will be staying here on all future trips to Montreal  
P => Excellent Location and value I booked this Hotel via internet website when I could not get hotel room at a conference venueriotThis is a converted office building with age The conversion is very well done resulting in large well laid out suites with all the amenities Stove Fridge dishwasher and eating utensils The location is superb and the value is excellent  
P => Lived up to expectations  Well Its true what everyone up to now has said about this hotel on Trip Advisor  iIts fantastic value for money we were a family of  Its bang in the middle off town almost oppersite the La Baie store like an up  ket Selfriges The staff on reception were helpful a d so polite and the concierges likewise In fact everywhere we went we found people to be friendly polite and helpful and this thing about French being a problem was simply not one we encountered anywhere Our room was massive and the kitchenette area was a suprising bonus  Breakfast was superb and no one objected on you carrying up a trayful of breakfast to eat in your room if you so wished  My husband and son aged  took full advantage of the gym and indoor swimming pool and on one sunny afternoon I spent a warm lazy hour listening to the sounds of the city below from the comfort of a sun lounger on the king  terracing on the top floor adjacent to the indoor pool area  Most places within the city are accessable by foot from the hotel  On a rainy day the underground world of the sub terrainean shopping and food mall was a revelation Cheap and cheerful pizzaria  doors up from the hotel provided superb delivery of pizzas and cold beers direct to our room within  mins of ordereing one evening  Fantastic service Other places to recomend are quotReubens quoton St Catherines and quotBaton Rougequot also on St CatherinesEast and adjacent to the Hyatt hotel but beware portions are enomrmous at bothTop of the attractions list was the Olympic stadium and the Bio dome those penguins were brilliant fun   the view from Mont Royal and the walk back down into town and a coach trip to Quebec  The countryside between the two cities this time of year was fantastic and we had the added bonus of a coach driver who turned into an entertaining and knowledgeable tour guide for some of the trip  All in all we found that everything was great value for money and would recommend both the hotel and the city as a great place for a weeks holiday We felt very safe everywhere including the Metro late on a Saturday evening in fact sad to say more safe there than we do in our own city Manchester Montreal has lots to offer and does not fail to deliver in fact it more than lived up to our expectations  
P => Excellent Excellent hotel great location clean comfortable nicely orated  We were upgraded from  bedroom to  bedroom suite upon arrival  Be sure to eat at the Restaurant ien rear of restaurant is across the street from the hotel  It was awesome Friendly and helpful staff  
P => Great Hotel in a Great Location We stayed for  nights in a suite with a king bed in a arate bedroom and a pull out sofa for our  boys aged  amp   Its in a great location right off St  Catherine St with easy access to the subway and shopping  The room was not brand new but was well maintained and very clean  Having a kitchen with a full sized refrigerator was great   it gave us a workspace for the kids they had homework to do while away for the weekend and it also was good to have a place to store a bottle of wine and to keep leftover pizza or whateverThe pool is a small but given the number of people using it  or  at a time it was more than adequate In the end having a very spacious room really made the trip nicer   at the end of the day when everyone need to chill out for a little bit no one had to crawl over each other Id highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying more than one person to a room or is planning on an extended business trip BTW for families that need good fast eats in the evening there is a great pizzeria right next door 
P => Too Right Trip Advisor We stayed at Le Square for three days and loved it  All the plusses everyone else cites    particularly the wonderfully helpful and considerate staff who leave you alone until you need something and then materialize with a solution a la Jeeves  Our poodle who stayed with us also loved it  The only change we would make is to add a restaurant but even without we plan to go back  
P => Loved it Tripadvisor was right on the k  Huge room possibly about  ft with tasteful or and design The pictures online dont do it full justice  Convenient lively location   comfortable at any time of day or night  Incredibly clean well kept   Fabulous front desk staff  Lovely top floor k and pool   and a spotless laundry room  Nice touch Definitely not your average corporate cookie cutter hotel  I wish more hotels followed this ones lead  
P => Great location Helpful and friendly staff Perfect for families We stayed here with our three children ranging in age from  months to  years  The rooms are very spacious and the in suite kitchen and dining table allowed us to eat some meals in the room when the kids were too tired to venture out for a late dinner The concierge recommended some great restaurants for carry out including the phenomenal pizza restaurant just down the sidewalk The roof k was beautiful and the pool although small was always spotlessly clean and never crowded Breakfast is mainly pastries and cereals but there is a wide selection and things are always fresh The location is close to everything  We walked to all the attractions we wanted to see including the old city  We would definitely stay here again As an aside I called the hotels regular number and got a high rate  When I called the  reservations number the next day I saved  a night from the price quoted the day before  
P => excellent hotel with a full kitchen in the room The Le Square Phillips Hotel is quite unusual in a good way  It is a solid four star hotel with a full kitchen in each room or suite  The kitchen includes a four burner stove and oven refrigerator and freezer microwave toaster dishwasher and a full set of dishes and cooking utensils  There also is a kitchen table with four chairs  The beds are very comfortable  The rooms are very large with extraordinarily high ceilings I would estimate  feet which adds to the sense of space  It is a very quiet hotel but centrally located and at the corner of a small square which helps prevent feeling boxed in in the middle of downtown  There are plenty of restaurants shops attractions and metro stops within walking distance  The valet parking is very convenient  Service is excellent  The lobby is quite small really just a hall from the doorway to the reception desk and not very conducive to lingering  The hotel doesnt have a restaurant just a large room on the second floor for the free continental breakfast  But there is a small restaurant next door that you can reach directly from the hotel lobby without going outside  Each room has free high speed internet access  For the price it is hard to imagine a better choice in Montreal  
P => Made our vacation Let me start by saying that we too loved the Square Philips and would not want to stay anywhere else in Montreal  Any minor negatives are clearly outwieghed by the major positives so when I list where the hotel fell short below do not take this as condemnation just what to expect and what not to expect  The hotel is well located close to shopping quite close to the old quarter and within a block of the undergrond city  The rooms are amazingly large   our family of  could comfortably have lived in our  bedroom suite  In addition to  bedrooms there was a good sized living are a large kitchenette includes   person kitchen table stove and fridge freezer large bathroom  Room was clean comfortable and quiet  Staff was helpfull  It was really more like an apartment than a hotel  Free wireless internet and a free quotbusiness centerquot with computers with internetAll this said the hotel earns its raves by being great value for money but falls a little short on the quotfancy extrasquot that a  star hotel often offers  For example there was no safe or mini bar the lobby restaurant was often closed the breakfast buffet was so so and the pool kind of small with no shallow end  In short if you are hoping for the Ritz and are willing to pay through the nose then this  not be for you for you but if you want a spacious comfortable hotel with attentive staff you cannot go wrong here  
P => Look no further    Best Hotel in Montreal Myself and family stayed at Le Square Philips while attending a conference in Montreal      After a lot of searching online for cheap deals and reading reviews we ided to book on the great reccomendations of other Trip Advisor members  We made a great choice This hotel is absolutely fabulous  The staff are helpful couteous friendly and eager to make your stay wonderful  The rooms are BIG  Because of a mixup with our rooms with stayed in both a delux studio and family suite  The studio was plenty of room for three people  Just be sure to request double beds  All the rooms are very spacious and have a full kitchen    a really great amenity The hotel is centally located a short walk to the St  Catherine Street close to the Place de Arts and about mins to Mc  Gill  Old Montreal is a bit farther  mins or so  There are several Metro Stops within walking distance  It was only a  walk to the Palais des Congres  So If youre in town for a conference this  be a better option than the overpriced convention centre hotels  There is also a great continental breakfast thats included in some reservations  We did have one small problem  a mix up with our reservation  When we booked through travelocity we requested two double beds  But when we arrive there were no rooms available with double beds   only one king  We spoke to the manager and the situation was handled very well  Not only were we not charged for the   extra person fee but we were moved to a family suite for the rest of our stay at no additional cost  Despite a mixup with our reservation  which was Travelocitys fault not the hotel we would definitely stay here again  
P => Yup   its really that good    If you scroll through the reviews here on TripAdvisor youll find that Le Square Phillips is almost universally loved by the membership  I have to chime in and say that I agree with the masses I was traveling with my wife father mother in law and   year old dhter  We ended up with two rooms   but let me tell you about the two bedroom suite we hadGot this for about C with a AAACAA discount  It included one bedroom with a King bed another with a Queen or was it Double a huge living room dining room and full kitchen  The ceilings were very high so it appeared even larger and there are large windows   the view was priily of office buildings but it was nice to have all that light The included breakfast is nice   lots of bagels Montreal style breads fruit juice coffee etc  There is a breakfast room in the hotel but you are welcome to pile up a tray and take it to your room   thats what we didLocation is right near rue Sainte Catherine one of the priy shopping streets of Montreal   on the opposite end of Square Phillips is The BayLa Baie   one of Canadas largest department store chains  Walking to the west on Ste Catherine are numerous shopping centers and restaurants  We did take out from Reubens deli and Mr  Mas Chinese and brought it back to the room   GREAT choice for a tired toddler Metro is two blocks away and cabs are easy to get Walking to the east on Ste Catherine it gets a little bit shadier   nothing dangerous in my opinion but many more strip clubs etc I didnt get to use the swimming pool but there is a nice lap pool exercise room and k up on the top of the building  Nice place to relax after sightseeing Dont miss Trattoria Zia next door theres an entrance in the lobby of the hotel Great Italian food and really nice hosts who let us try all kinds of goodies while we were waiting for our food Finally the high speed internet in the room free made it easy to keep in touch with the office Just a couple of small negatives  The lap pool was too deep for me to feel comfortable taking my dhter in   no steps or quotshallow end quot  Although internet access was free they charged C  to make a quottoll freequot call  Seems a bit petty to me Overall a great place for families or for a business trip  The other room we had was a C studio with dining area and kitchen  I would definitely consider staying there again when visiting Montreal   you should too 
P => The best hotel that Ive ever been to My husband sister and friend visited Montreal this past weekend and per the recommendation from this website ided to stay at Square Phillips hotel  We are so glad that we did We rented a suite for  a night which had one king size bed as well as a pull out day bed  Split between the four of us the cost was only  a person per night which you really cant beat The hotel is right in the center of downtown and extremely posh and clean  The rooms are very tastefully orated   very modern and hip and again VERY clean  The staff is extremely helpful and recommended great restaurants and bars for us to try out  We were also served a continental breakfast every morning which came free with the hotel price I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough Its the best value for the price and is far better than most fancier hotels that Ive been to  
P => Very Good Hotel My friends and I stayed at Le Square Phillips from       We chose it because of Trip Advisor  We got a one bedroom suite  The hotel is charming with an elegant lobby and spacious rooms  The ceilings are high and the room was very clean and comfortable  Every morning we received a continental breakfast as part of our room rate  The concierge was very helpful and promptly arranged for my taxi to return to the airport  They of course speak fluent French and English  The only negative things I have to say about the hotel is that the coffee is not very good and the lighting in the rooms could be brighter  Since we were always outside it didnt bother us as we didnt need to use the room lights and we got very good coffee at other cafes in Montreal  I would stay here again  
P => fabulous huge more than expected The room was huge and so comfortable the only quotcomplaintquot that we had was the water pressure in the shower was not very strong but that was greatly made up for  For  a night we got a full bathroom kitchen with sitting area with stove and oven microwave and full fridge as well as a dishwashwer a huge living space and a giant bed erated from the rest of the room by a frosted glass partition  The room was awesome  The breakfast was really good cereal muffins fruit etc The pool area was nice the view was awesome deffinatly bring a camera and take some pictures One concierge was a little uninformed about places in the area besides night clubs but the others were very helpful  I highly recomend this hotel  Great location parking is close and expensive but that how it is in any city  Over all a very good experience 
P => Great place great location great staff My wife three young children   and  and I stayed here for four nights in late yearly ust  We had read the very positive reviews on tripadvisor and they are all correct We had a  bedroom suite which was enormous  My wife and I stayed in the bedroom with a bed big enough for all of us to do storytime at bedtime our two older ones slept on the pull out sofa which was fairly comfortable and our youngest slept in a Pack n Play portable crib that the hotel provided for free The room had a full kitchen including dishwasher large bath roomy closets high ceilings and large windows  In short five people of any age would not feel cramped here The kids loved the swimming pool on the roof of course  It is on the small side but its good for an end of day release  I felt sorry for the woman trying to do laps while my two older kids and some other kids splashed around  Outside of the pool there is a terrace where people were sunning themselves  That same spot also provided a good vantage point for seeing the nighttime summer fireworks during our stay Breakfast is included and it is fairly good  They have muffins bagels croissants cereal four or five brands coffee tea fruit juices  You can load up and take it back to your room or you can eat in the dining area which is clean bright and rather nice except for the TV with CNN on in one room    dont need to have war footage for the kiddies to watch first thing there was another room without a TV  The staff in the breakfast room are very nice too The front desk staff were exceptionally good  Montreal in general was a very friendly place but the hotel staff were the creme de la creme  Any question asked was greeted with good cheer a desire to be helpful and best yet great information  There is a major shopping street Ste Catherine steps away a Metro stop a few minutes away and a large grocery store IGA only a five minute walk away The hotel has a business center with two computers and printers that guests can use for free  It was a great way to check e mail All in all I would recommend this hotel without any qualifications  
P => One night stay My wife dhter and I stayed at Le Square Phillips for one night on Sunday ust   We had a king bed with a pull out couch  The room was huge bigger than many ski condos we have stayed in  The kitchen was adequately equipped for simple cooking  The rooftop pool was perfect and the outside k around it well above the city fray  The continenatl breakfast was good with fresh food and lots of hot coffee  The hotel is very convenient to St  Catherine and valet parking was prompt  If you want to pay the money we cant think of any reason a traveling family wouldnt stay here  If eating out isnt a main goal of your vacation the money you save by shopping at the IGA a few blocks walk away and cooking in the large room willmore than make up for the cost of the hotel  All of us recommend Le Square Phillips 
P => Terrific Hotel My teenage dhters and I stayed here from ust      and we were very pleased  The location couldnt have been better    it was within a block of the main shopping street St  Catherine and perhaps two blocks from the subway  The hotel is quiet and very nicely appointed  The staff was courteous knowledgeable and helpful  The Continental breakfast was quite sufficient to start the day and we had an excellent dinner in the first floor Italian restaurant Zia  We would definitely stay here again  
P => Wonderful Stay at the Square Phillips Just returned from a  day stay at Le Square Phillips and i have to say that my wife and I were truly impressed  Me and my wife both  chose the hotel after we read the reviews on this site  We booked directly on the hotels website and got a great price with our AAA membership Upon arriving at the hotel we were pleasantly greeted by the Concierge who immediately arranged to have the bags unloaded and car parked  Check in took less than  minutes and the front desk staff were VERY pleasant  Our luggage arrived no more than  seconds after we entered the room We had a One Bedroom Suite on the sixth floor  Upon entering the room we were stunned by the size cleanliness and furnishings  The suite was honestly larger than my first two apartments The room was absolutley spotless it is obvious that the staff work hard to keep the place very nice  The kitchen was stocked with pots pans plates and every utensil you  need if you feel like cooking and there is a full size dishwashing machine refridgerator and plenty of cabinet space  Not a speck of dirt  The bathroom was large spacious and clean  Plenty of towels etc  Only complaint was that the water pressure wasnt very strong in the shower otherwise perfect  Livingdining room area was very nice and had comfortable seating and dining areas  Also a sofa bed  The TV stand allowed for the TV to be pulled out and swiveled for easy viewing in any part of the room  The bedroom had a King size bed which was very firm and comfortable LOTS of closet space  Also a desk and TV The hotel is surprisingly quiet and in the rooms you almost never hear the outside world  The housecleaning staff are very detailed and even washed our dishes  The pool is small but very very nice and there is also a very comfortable sun k which is also small but nice  The location is great as well  After checking with the concierge we were given a map and directions everywhere we wanted to go the hotel is very central and about  minutes walk from the Metro station  The walk to Old Montreal should be reserved for generally active adults but was pleasant and not too far of a distance should you wish to do it  We saw many sights and didnt take the car out of the garage until we checked out Check out took about the same amount of time as check in and again the staff was VERY nice after noticing some confusion on our faces about a portion of the bill the staff happily took the time to go over every single tax and charge on the bill  Just an FYI there are a LOT of taxes on the hotels We will definitley book at Le Square Phillips when we return to Montreal 
P => Excellent but not perfect Stayed for a week with the wife on a business trip  Agree that Le Phillips Square is an excellent hotel  Spacious rooms with high ceilings  Very clean  It was not perfect of course  My wife and I found the king bed to be quite firm more like a futon than a plush matress and box spring set  The first room we had was on a non smoking floor but the previous occupant had ignored the rules  They were very helpful to get us moved to a new room  The rooftop pool is modern and well maintained but it is a lap pool and there is little extra room to just lounge in the water when three peope are swimming laps  Bur we would defineily go back 
P => I concur   this is a great hotel My husband and I vacationed in Montreal at this hotel y    As we all have read it is true   the rooms are huge Our Jr Suite had TWO closets   the normal sliding door type and a huge walk in too  The hotel and rooms are spotless  The hotel staff is outstanding  I have all of these things to say even with the hotel being sold out during our stay  With that amount of people in the hotel I was very impressed that they could live up to their outstanding Trip Advisor reputation  My highest compliments go to the staff  Housekeeping was great and worked with us to know when we would be out of the room  The front desk staff actually looked you in the eye when they spoke to you stopped what they were doing and truly helped you Ive been to endless numbers of hotels and these traits are rare  The bellmen double as concierge and they did both jobs perfectly This is not a negative to the hotel but I dont agree with many that the location of the hotel is supurb  Yes it is very convenient to the Metro on St Catherine but the Metro itself isnt the answer to all your destinations  Granted we were there with temps over  degrees and the Metro is not air conditioned in the stations nor on the trains so we only used the Metro if it was very convenient for our destination The walk to Old Montreal is short  mins but it is very down hill going therefore very uphill returning  The return is tough after  hours of walking around site seeing and the high temps and we are actually in shape  Ill leave a arate post later in the Forums on my general thoughts and tips on Montreal My only negatives for the hotel is the room AC and towels  The room is so large they really could use another AC unit  The one is great at night when the sun is down but doesnt do much during the daylight hours though Montreal overall isnt very interested in AC The hotel towels are standard hotel towels   the kind good for exfoliating OUCH  They are thick enough but few hotels have learned the fine art of soft towels Enjoy your stay This hotel is an excellent one 
P => Terrific We had a  bedroom suite for  children and  adults which was large and roomy  The location was great and was near downtown shopping museums and the subway system  The room appeared to be newly orated and was unbelievable quiet considering the location in the heart of the city  
P =>   in Montreal Our stay was during the dates of      The stay for three nights was absolutely the best hotel experience I have had for years  There was my wife and I along with our  year old son The hotel shows its youthful age and it is soundly constructed to last  The cleanliness of the property is impeccable  We occupied a double suite which had two double beds  The suite was well over  sq feet in size and a ceiling that was in excess of    It was located on the third floor to the hotels back and sound proofing was exceptional  Our room overlooked a large parking lot and if I had not looked out the window I would not have known it existed The pool and sun k were located on the top floor  The pool is far from Olympic size however on a hot humid Montreal day it provides a more then reasonable place to cool off  The sun k is spacious and offers at least  chair loungers for guest use  My complaint on the pool k is that it does not provide direct access to the outside as all doors were locked  You are required to walk around the pool through the weight room and onto the k  The hotel service and staff was exceptional  It appeared they were happy to be there and serve the client needs  The continental breakfast rivals anything you will have elsewhere including home  Fresh fruit toast bagels cereal muffins and juice x  along with coffeetea  The service at the breakfast was impeccable with at least three servers for your needs  The area to eat was good and well setup however you do have the return to your room option  Just remember you have a fully equipped kitchen in you suite for reheating as well as toasting bread  The closest grocery store we could find was in Place Desjardins and it will meet and exceed all your needs  Easiest walk to the store is on Rene Levesque Blvd   approx  city blocks Location says it all close to shops metro and Rue Ste Catherine  Lots of good restaurants nearby which include Nickels and Reuben s on Ste Catherine  Burger King is outside the hotel and down a block for the late night cravings  I hate to expound the virtues of this location as it could make it more difficult to reserve in the future  It was such a positive experience that you cannot help but want to share with others Trip Advisor fromKentvillea Scotia 
P => stay here we were worried about driving in montreal but this hotel was so easy to find  the porter unloaded our car and parked it for us  when we checked in we were given an upgrade the first one we have ever had  the room was enormous compared to all the other hotels we had stayed in  we had a lounge area  bedrooms bathroom and kitchen  it was stly orated plain and simplenot over fussy  it did not feel like a hotel as there were never hoards of people roaming around everyone knew what they were doing and it made it feel more comfortable and easy going  the hotel is situated right in downtown but not in an overbusy street were the crowds tend to gather  shopping bars and restaurants are one way while the old town is the other both within  minutes eay walk  a great hotel in a great location at a great price we would always stay here if we ever came back to montreal 
P => Great hotel in great locaton This hotel lives up to its billing as the best of Montreal  We received a complimentary upgrade to a ior suite on the top floor and enjoyed a great room with lots of space  tvs a arate sleeping area a kitchen and a large bathroom though only one sink  The front desk clerks were bilingual and were EXTREMELY helpful and kind  The only complaint about the hotel would be the parking  There is private valet parking that you will pay a premium for though it is secure inside the hotel  It  be cheaper to use the lot to the left of the front of the building as the hotel parking ran us  a day with taxes and tips to the valet  My wife was impressed when she accidentally left  in the car and found it there untouched the next day when the valet brought us the car  The breakfast is standard fare nothing too rekable but you simply must get to the roof which you can access from the stairs and one of the  elevators where you will enjoy a great view from the terrace outside the pool area  We were even able to see fireworks over the old city during the jazz festival  Great time 
P => Spacious and gracious I was in town for the International Reggae Festival and had the pleasure of staying at this hotel  The rooms are spacious each equipped with a kitchen and full refrigerator These amenities obviously come in quite handy for before and after parties  The staff were fantastic and the hotel is in a great location a few steps off Ste  Catherine and walking distance to Vieux Port Latin Quarter and downtown shopping  Also there is a great french restaurant ien directly across the street  
P => Great Room Great Service My wife six year old son and I spent three nights at Le Square Phillips  Our one bedroom suite was spacious and spotless  The front desk and conceirge staff were extremely friendly and helpful  The continental breakfast standard fare of fruits cereals breads is served in a nice second floor dining room We give the hotel high ks for sound proofing  Despite having small children for neighbors we could not hear a sound between the rooms  The cleaning staff did a great job even cleaning the dishes in our kitchen sink which we did not expect The location was fantastic on a relatively quiet side street very close to multiple shopping malls and Metro stations  There are countless restaurant options close to the hotel A heads up on the rooftop pool for parents of young children  The pool has a uniform depth of roughly  m  Our little guy was a little freaked out to not have a spot where he could touch bottom  
P => Still the best This hotel deserves to be No    I just returned from a  day visit to Montreal and stayed at Le Square Phillips for the second time  Service was just as wonderful as the first time more than two years ago  The facilities and location are unbeatable  its between two Metro stops and within walking distance to Old Montreal as well as Chinatown  Once you experience the size and cleanliness of the rooms and other facilities youll know why the hotel provides the best value  If you add to that the efficiency and friendliness of both the Concierge and Front Desk staff then you certainly have a winner  
P => Perfect place to stay in Montreal We stayed at Le Square Phillips during the Jazz Festival  I booked  rooms for  nights each  Our entire group loved the hotel   it had helpful and friendly service clean and spacious accommodations helpful and knowledgable concierge   I can go on I ordered a rollaway bed for an additional CAD night in our one room suite  It worked out perfectly for our family of   Even with the rollaway in our room with two queen beds we still had plenty of room The continental breakfast included in the price of the room was fresh and included a nice variey of pastries muffins and croissants as well as fruits cereal oatmeal and several juices  One morning I ided to bring the food into our room  That worked nicely Before we arrived in Montreal I had called several times about possible tours  The concierge was very helpful   going as far as doing a bit of quotresearch quot on possible tours and had even called me back  Waving down a taxi was never a problem in front of the hotel Shopping is extremely convenient  The Baie one of the flagship department stores is within one short block of the hotel  The entrance to the underground cityshopping is about   short blocks away  Distance to Vieux Montreal is about   mins walking   luckily its mostly downhill going to Vieux Montreal  We normally took a cab back to the hotel in the evening from Vieux Montreal cost is about  CAD I asked the front desk for restaurant recommendations and they gave suggestions which turned out to be excellent  We were hungry when we arrived and wanted something quick to eat  Terrye at the front desk suggested the Italian pizzeria a few hundred feet from the hotel  Food was delicious   very similar to the pizza in Rome Other wonderful places to eat in Vieux Montreal are Hod Fou specializes in lobster dishes and Le Sauvagine French  Service always seemed to be slow wherever we ate but I think its because were always so used to eating quickly and being rushed  Every place we went had friendly and attentive service but the pace was slower than what we are normally used to in California   I mean this is as a good thing to actually be able to relax and savor a delicious meal in a lovely setting One other unexpected surprise is the Italian restaurant Zia next to the entrance of the hotel  They had some of the most delicious homemade pasta  The chef even prepared dishes to accommodate our request   didnt have to be on the menu  After a full day in Quebec City we didnt feel like going far for dinner  Thats what prompted us to try the restaurant  Were so glad we did We found out that they deliver to the rooms in the hotel All in all our experience with Le Square Phillips and Montrealwas excellent  Our entire family highly recommends this hotel for short of long stays each suite has a completed kitchen  
P => Great location great place to stay My wife and I stayed at Le Square Phillips for  nights in e  and loved it  Its very conveniently located between two subway stations and is within walking distance of numerous restaurants and the Old Town  The staff is very helpful and knowledgable and the rooms are spacious and well appointed  The rooms have a complete kitchen as well so you can shop locally like at the terrific kets at Jean Talon and Atwater and save on eating out all the time  And even though its right downtown traffic noise is all but nonexistent  At about  a night US with taxes and the rate of exchange at that time its not particularly cheap but its well worth the price which includes free high speed wireless internet and a free breakfast  We would recommend Le Square Phillips without hesitation to anyone who wants a quiet classy convenient place to stay in Montreal  
P => Worth every dollar I had been recommended to stay at this hotel by a fellow trip advisor user  By far everyone who has posted on this hotel has been correct  It was the perfect hotel  My family stayed in the two bedroom apartment for one week  It was HUGE My dhter was in awe  We traveled with our two dhters lt years and the place was perfect for us  Le Square Phillips provided us with a crib and high chair  The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes pots pans dishwashing soap yes there is a dishwasher and all the appliances you need  You can easily drive to the Atwater or Jean Talon kets for full experience of good fresh foods  The open floor plan allowed my dhter enough space to run around and spread out her toys without mom and dad stepping on them  Tons of storage space and you cant hear your neighbors at all  We did go for breakfast every morning  you can eat there or take it to your room and picked up a National Post on the way in  The parking is   but the convenience of not worrying about parking and the ease of calling and getting it immediately were worth it  We did get a discount since we were staying there  nights as well as using our AAA  The staff were so helpful in their suggestions and directions  The location is close to the metro and in walking distance of Old Montreal  We have stayed at different hotels and bedamp breakfasts but this surpassed them  We will definitely come back again and would highly recommend it to everyone  
P => Magnificent in Montreal My ision to book a room at this hotel came after reading all the other raving reviews about it posted on this site  Well I can surely say that my boyfriend and I were nothing but pleased with the entire experience  We tend to take a lot of weekend trips to getaway for a night or two  We have stayed at quite a lot of hotels and the Square Phillips Hotel met all of our expectations and needs if not exceeded them  The staff is in fact very friendly and accommodating  They genuinely seem like they want to help and were always very pleasant  The rooms are beautiful with high ceilings comfortable beds and great bath tubs The cleanliness of the room was also impeccable We like to sample different hotels whenever we travel but if ever we spend a weekend in Montreal again I will most definitely book at this hotel again without even searching for any quotbetter dealsquot  The parking is also convenient since the staff will park the car for you in the underground garage and get it for you with only a few minutes notice Valet parking I guess Its worth the   charge  The location of the hotel is in easy walking distance of the Eatons Centre Simons Les Ailes du Mode for shopaholics like me Old Montreal and St  Catherine St  Restaurants and bars are also nearby or a short metro ride or cab ride away  There is so much to see and do in Montreal that a hotel cannot possibly be close to everything but this place is in a great spot I would definitely reccommend this hotel for a wonderful experience Check out quotLa Maison Du Jazzquot for a great supper and live jazz music its only a  minute walk away 
P => Excellent stay I have stayed at this hotel before  The staff is very friendly and helpful  I had a two bedroom suite  It consisted of a full kitchen dining area living room bathroom and two bedrooms  It was very clean and there was very little wear and tear  The only negative was a slightly musty smell that I noticed each time I entered the suite  There were two televisions   one in the master bedroom and one in the living room and at the risk of sounding spoiled a television in the second bedroom would have been nice  Breakfast was a nice continental breakfast   muffinsbreads and bagels cream cheese butter peanut butter coffee juices cereals and fruit salad  We stayed for three nights and at our third breakfast there was no cream cheese or fruit salad as there had been the day before  No big deal  The location is excellent  Centrally located right off Catherine Street  The only parking is valet parking but we would call for our car five minutes before we left the room and it would be waiting for us downstairs by the time we got there All in all an excellent stay  
P => Fabulous location and hotel We stayed at Le Square Philips from   to    The hotel is immaculate staff is wonderful and the location is great  The staff was particularly friendly and helpful they gave us some of the best recommendations for meals   iens is one block away and worth a visit   I highly recommend staying here   just be advised that if you drive there is a  day charge for parking your car  Enjoy 
P => Wonderful   Just as described My boyfriend and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend  And we absolutely loved it  We stayed in one of the studios  It was immaculate with huge ceilings and plenty of room to move about  The rooftop sunk was was spectacular   awesome reclining chairs with an incredible view of the city  Hanging out up there was a perfect end to a long day of sightseeing  I cant say enough about the staff  They spoke both French and English and were available to help at every turn  The breakfast was a little sparce  But you cant expect too much when its free  And the location was awesome   right downtown two blocks from both the green and orange metro lines and within walking distance to Old Montreal  Highly recommend  
P => grand I ided to book Le Square Phillips based on its rank on Tripadvisor and also its reasonable price  Our family of  loved the room  Originally I called to book a standard room  For the same price they offered me a ior suite much bigger  When we arrived they upgraded us to a family suite And it was gorgeous  Everything was tastefully orated  Very clean and very spacious  We were there for one night arriving on a Sunday for a wedding that day  The staff were polite and friendly  Actually I had also booked the place because the website showed a lovely indoor pool on the rooftop  I was sorely disappointed when I arrived to find out that the pool would be closed to be repainted starting Monday  I think that this should have been disclosed on their website  My  year dhter was really looking forward to using the pool Monday morning  The accomodation also included a continental breakfast buffet which included coffee juice breads cereals and fruit  Nothing fancy  A nice touch was that the breads had the Montreal style bagels which I love  The parking is expensive at    taxes but this is on par with other downtown hotels  The only problem is that there is no self parking only valet parking  So wherever youre going leave at least  minutes for the valet to get your car  Or call the concierge ahead from your room to have your car available  I frankly prefer self parking and would liked that option to avoid the waiting and the tipping everytime  
P => Great value for money I am glad once again I trusted Tripadvisor Le Square Phillips proved to be exactly what most previous reviewers already mentioned  Very clean great location nice beds cute pool and gym and good service I could not ask for more  Only the breakfast room reminds a little of a factory canteen and gets me to the one thing the place is missing athmosphere  
P => NOT a mistake Two couples celebrated birthdays together at Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites and chose the hotel because of its spectacular location and the numerous complimentary reviews posted here at Trip Advisor  Were luck enough to live in Vermont only  minutes from Montreal and are very familiar with the city and many of the hotels there  When we arrived at our room my jaw dropped   and I immediately called the front desk to inquire whether there had been a mistake   I thought wed been assigned a room with a much higher rate but the friendly folks there assured me that we were indeed in a standard room  Wow  The details listed in other reviews about Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites regarding extreme cleanliness high quality friendly service and incredible location are NOT exagerations  
P => my new favorite I stayed at this hotel and it was the best experience Ive ever had I booked this hotel because I needed something close to the train station and I really wasnt expecting much  I was amazed how far   went I got a  sqft studio with a king bed and it had a full kitchen and a huge bathroom The or is amazing and the hotel itself was spotlessThe towels in my room were very thirsty and soft  The bedding was of amazing quality as well  I will admit that the bed was nothing compared to the ones at the Sheraton but I still had a good nights sleep and despite that I was still more satisfied here than the Sheraton which was going for about   that night I will note that I heard absolutely nothing coming from the hallway at night unlike a reviewer saying that they could hear the elevators buzzing all over I didnt hear anything and I was right near the elevator  I think they only buzz when you push a floor button I forget but theres no ding or anything when they reach your floor  It spooked me the first time and its just a little tacky but it didnt really bother me Breakfast was very nice The pool and sunk were nice touches Im never staying anywhere else when Im in Montreal 
P => Bzzzzz BZZZZZZZZZZZsound familliar If you stayed in this hotel it should thats when you know your elevator has arrived  And boy you can hear it throughout the hotel  And what a hotel it was  My apartment in manhattan is  times as small and  times as much  These rooms you could live in comfortably  The bargain is excellent  The ceilings are so high you wouldnt think you are even in an apartment let alone a hotel  The rooms were immaculate one could almost hear the ting and see the sparkle  Some veiws though were of the parking garage and skyscraper next door but my view was of the olympic stadium in the distance  The staff was excellent i find it hard to believe that last reviewer who complained about it but then again i wasnt there  My only complaint if any is that they have more computers in the lounge they only have  so bring your laptop  As well it was a shame they closed the k overlooking the city by the pool at  at night it was a great hang out  The pool was a bit small but adequate  The breakfast was far better thern what you would get at any continental joint yet not exactly restaurant fare  As far as those location complainers what large city will you not find strip clubs If you complain about this hotel being a block away from a loud busy street then dont take a city vacation  And besides the hotel was close to serene itself so why complain You are in very close proximity to everything the biodome olympic park st  denis street highly reccomended McGill etc etc  If you dont like the breakfast then order in or just cook yourself in the kitchen with a DISHWASHER they provide for you  What i would give to come home and have le square phillips come with me I could honeslty live in this place   and a half out of  stars im tough to please i only reserve  stars for only one experiance my life but do far this one comes close  
P => Close to everything and yet quiet and pleasent I have stayed in Montreal every summer for over a ade and by a fluke we found this relativly new hotel just a few years ago  We have stayed ever since  the rooms are spacious and comfortable  And although the room views are by no means exciting the view from the rooftop pool as well as the breakfast buffet are fine  The location is great as you are close to everything in the center of the city and the metro is very easily accessible  The staff has always been attentive and helpful  There  be less expensive hotels in the city but there are few as pleasent to stay at  
P => Extremely pleased Stayed for  nights extremely pleased  This hotel met my picky requirements  Rooms are clean spacious and attractive Great downtown location  
P => Why is it rated number  because it is the best My dhter and I just returned home from our stay in Montreal  We chose Le Square Philip Hotel based on recommendations on Tripadvisor  Thank you to all whom have stayed before and made such wonderful recommendations  It was fabulous Nothing about the hotel disappointed us  The room was extremely large with a full kitchen eating area a king sized bed  The bathroom was also quite spacious with enough room for my dhters cosmetics hair products perfume hair straightener etc    with enough room for left for Mom  The room was quiet and exceptionally clean the service was excellent the staff polite and helpful  The location was also perfect for us close to everything  I would definitely stay again 
P => Excellent experience highly recommended I stayed at Le Square Phillips il     I was attending a conference at the Palais du Congres it was an easy walk   minutes  I stayed at a suite that cost less than regular rooms at the conference hotels  The suite was very spacious it included a nice round table with four chairs where you could have dinner a fully featured kitchen with a regular sized stove and refrigerator same size as I have in my house microwave oven coffeemaker etc  The room also had a desk with an Ethernet plug for free high speed Internet two phones a TV and an alarm clock The staff was very friendly and provided superior service  I had to receive and send two faxes and they were delivered and sent promptly  I had a small issue with not finding an iron or ironing board apparently someone previously at my suite quotborrowedquot them and within a half hour they were opening up boxes in my room with a brand new iron and a brand new ironing board  The room was  very  clean and the maid service was very professional I also found the room to be very quiet  I didnt really hear people in the rooms next to mine or above  I did see a few people in my floor when enteringleaving so I know the hotel wasnt empty the breakfast room was almost full everytime I went You also get breakfast with your room  Nothing spectacular but you get fruit bagels croissants muffins cereal coffee and tea Given my experience I very highly recommend this hotel  
P => Excellent family hotel Le Square Phillips Hotel is an absolutely perfect family spot We stayed in one of the two bedroom suites with our three children  There was plenty of room daily maid service a full kitchen   I cannot imagine a better place to stay All the staff were friendly and helpful  There is a daily breakfast served which was also very nice  The pool was a favorite for our children and the view from it was magnificent  I also had the chance to use their laundry room  It was extremely clean and almost a pleasure to wash clothesThe price location cleanliness and staff made Le Square Phillips the best place we have ever stayedHighly recommend 
P => What a gem not to mention a bargain Im currently staying in this hotel and it is just perfectThe entire hotel is just spic and span and the service is simply excellent And I would have to say that it is the best value you can find on weekends as you can get a huge studio suite on the weekends for as little as   There is a little pool and an exercise room on the top floor and both are kept up very well  I would definately have to say that this is my new favorite here in Montreal and it cost me over   less than the SheratonIll recommend this hotel to absolutely anyone and its too bad that I have to leave to go back home tomorrow Liam Walshe 
P => huge rooms I disagree with those who like the location unless you like being near to strip clubs  Then again in Montreal you are pretty much always near such clubs no matter where you stay  Other than the location though this place was great  The rooms are absolutely enormous and the staff was superb    friendly and delightfully helpful  I stayed there with  children who thought the room was excellent    I agreed with them for once  
P => Great Family Hotel Stayed here with my family of  on the weekend  Great location and facilities  Highly recommend it for families  
P => Cest Magnifique Montreal and this hotel were the highlight of our vacation  My husband and I took our  and  year olds for a week  The room was positively cavernous  The kids could play and watch tv in the living room while we relaxed in the bedroom  We used the swimming pool which was rather small but fine for kids  The staff were tremendously helpful and friendly  Shopping restaurants and attractions were within walking distance  Breakfast was great lots of options that got us off to a great start everyday  If you are seeing Montreal with children this hotel is perfect  Enough room for everyone to spread out  
P => Great great great My family    kids  adults   stayed there in uary in a two bedroom suite  We were so pleased with the experience  As my kids say   it was awesome It was quotlow seasonquot in Montreal and very cold so we spent a lot of time in the hotel  We stayed for  nights for my husbands business  The rooms were absolutely huge with beautiful tall ceilings  We bought food at the IGA nearby and cooked some of our own in the kitchen enjoyed the breakfast they provided every morning used the small rooftop pool   there was never anyone there   the workout facilities and the laundry  I was impressed with all aspects of the hotel  It was close to Eatons center and the Bay shopping malls and on the same block as three fabulous restaurants  I highly recommend it and would not have to even think twice about staying there again   it was unbelievable  
P => Great Location We have stayed at this hotel three times now and love it  The hotel is very clean and the rooms very spacious  We have stayed in a one bedroom and also the ior suite and for the money would recommend the ior suite  The staff are courteous and pleasant and the hotel is kept very clean  It is a great place to stay 
P => EXCELLENT This hotel goes ABOVE and BEYOND my expectations I came across it searching for hotels in Montreal and never heard of it  Apparently it was walking distance to where my husband was going for an interview  I was hesitant about making reservations here but after reading the TON of reviews not many people would go out of their way to write reviews unless it was real good or real bad and having a pleasant conversation with reservations i went ahead and booked it  NO REGRETS I am a very very picky person most especially when it comes to service cleanliness and safety  The service was excellent from the very beginning to end Everyone at the front desk the bellboyvalet guy cleaning crew were sooo friendly and helpful We got a ior suite for my husband our mon old son and myself  The room was HUGE comfortable clean and orated nicely  The kitchen was a HUGE plus   great for those w kids lots of windows HUGE bathroom etc  I especially liked the hugh ceilings  Free breakfast is ALWAYS nice and a BIG convenience  Huge selection  So to those of you looking for a place to stay in MOntreal Le square Phillips is the ONE  THe BEST value for your money and i cannot stress enough how wonderful the service was  Hope they keep it up 
P => Cant go wrong with kids We stayed here for the New Year with our  kids and can thoroughly recommend this hotel for families  We booked the Square Phillips after checking the reviews on this website and we were not disappointed  It was our first time in Montreal so it was convenient that the hotel is so centrally located  The service we received was excellent our room was huge and fully equipped the choice for breakfast was very good too  It is a small hotel with a small lobby and a small pool which was perfect for us however  not suit everyone   I think if I came again to Montreal with just my partner we would choose a different hotel but I know if we come with kids wed choose the Square Phillips anytime  Note   we did ask for a smoking room but were given non smoking 
P => Superb Central Hotel GranGramps Mum and Grandchild stayed in Deluxe  bedroom suite best choice for sleeping  comfortably  Spacious living area and main bedroom nd bedroom possibly getting a little small for mum and rollaway bed for granchild  Great central location so dont need car  valet parked  Really friendly and helpful staff  Small heated pool but nobody else there when we went  Small but useful and cheap cafeshop attached to hotel For good vegetarian meal choice try Le Commensal very busy at lunchtimeat corner Rue St Catherine and McGill  
P => Nice apartment hotel   with a few warnings Le Square Phillips is an apartment hotel  It is very clean and it is situated in the center of downtown Montreal  It is a very busy area during the day and you can easily walk to many of the stores and restaurants in the area  It is also not very far from the old city  During the night though it is not the best area to be at and some people  not feel comfortable walking there late at night The room that we stayed in was clean spacious and nicely orated  The noise from the street was very reasonable although I should mention that we stayed on the th floor A few Warnings   The windows at this hotel do not open  In addition they would not guarantee a non smoking room when you make a reservation  Good Luck     If you do not like to hear screaming babies at night and kids playing in the hallways during the day this  not be the place for you  This is the case with most apartment hotels though    The people at the reception were generally not very nice and there were many times when the reception was left unattended The concierge was very nice though  
P => Great Hotel We stayed at Le Square Phillips Hotel in    after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor  All of the positive comments were accurate  The room was huge and even had a kitchen  It had architectural features that were lovely with special lighting on dimmers  The staff couldnt have been nicer  A concierge desk is available round the clock and they helped us with money exchange sightseeing advice and great restaurant suggestionsreservations  There was also free internet and a lovely expanded continental breakfast  
P => Spacious and great value for  couples For Cnight the  bedroom suite is a great value if you have  couples traveling together  There is only  bathroom but the rooms are new nice and these suites are extremely large  The bedrooms are on opposite sides of the suite too so are private but you will have to fight over who gets the bigger one with the TV  After a day on the town we would buy dessert at the little store in the lobby make coffee in the room and have dessert on the dining room table while reflecting on the day  The location is central but Montreal is a big city so we ended up using the car more than we were hoping to didnt walk to any attractions just dinner  The underground shopping malls were close and convenient but the quality of the nearby shops werent as nice as I had hoped to make this a major selling point  The breakfast was strictly continental breads pastries and fruit but adequate   its included in the cost of the room  Also the free WiFi is a great amenity Overall this is a great option for  couples or families but if I were going again as just a couple  choose to go somewhere more serene and less in the hustle bustle of the big city  
P => Perfect for families Traveling with two young children can be difficult and after too many horrible experiences of one room hotels we vowed we would never do it again no matter what the cost  With this in mind we searched for a two room hotel suite for our recent  day trip to Montreal  This hotel offered all the facilities and services essential for parents traveling with young children  We stayed in a family one bedroom suite that had a arate bedroom and a sleeping alcove  We put the kids in the bedroom and my partner and I slept in the alcove  With a full kitchen and sitting area and a big bathroom it was the most pleasant stay weve had together so far The fact that breakfast is also included really helped ease the stress levels  You can either take the family down for the cold buffet breakfast  types of toast  types of bagels croissant muffins fruit yogurt tea coffee juice cereal spreads or make up a tray and bring it back to your fully equipped kitchen and eat at your leisure The staff were very friendly and helpful especially for us non French speaking Aussies and the valet parking made everything so simple  The hotel was walking distance to a great shopping district and good family restaurant options The room was spotlessly clean and serviced each day  The price was great for the suite   well never stay anywhere else in Montreal  
P => We Absolutely Loved This Hotel We booked this hotel solely on what we had read in these reviews and although we were leery we were not disappointed  Huge apartment style rooms including a walk in closet and kitchen clean as a whistle comfortable king size bed friendly accomodating staff and located right smack dab in the middle of everything  Rue St  Catherine was a block away with all the shopping restaurants Metro etc  We loved it and we will definitely stay here again when we return to Montreal  Breakfast was just ok   great for cereal and toast etc  but it gets a bit boring after a couple of days  Good coffee Go elsewhere for eggs and waffles  Nanny 
P => Awesome Location style space and service  Situated near main entertainment shopping area and inbetween two metro stops different lines this is a perfect hotel  The continental breakfast is awesome and can be taken back to your room to enjoy in your dining area yes  The bathroom was huge and with so much space in the room we had a fab time  The cost was very reasonable for such an experience that included free internet access a pool a little small and excellent balcony view from the top floor  Thank you Please note that I stayed with friends so I do not know if such good value for a single traveller  
P => Great with kids   so roomie  Why stay in an expansive regular hotel whan you can have an appartment for cheap Great to have  rooms and a big living rooms with the kids  No noise at all  High ceiling  Requably nice and efficient staff Breakfast could be disappointing if you like the hot stuff   literaly  eggs bacon fried potatoes    They dont have it  But all the rest is so good and fresh that you forget that you miss it by the second day Nice location not far from Vieux Port Really the best option with kids NB great sunk on top of building for sun worshipers   but small swimming pool  
P => Absolutely perfect We stayed at Le Square Phillips ober  th and we were very happy  The rooms are immense with ceilings   feet high  Despite the hotel being completely booked it was very quiet  Our rate included free breakfast for all three of us and it was really very good I cant say enough for the polite friendly and effortlessly bilingual staff  Their service was spectacular  My spouse is very particular about cleanliness of hotel rooms  Our room was spotless  She now tells me that well never stay anywhere else when in Montreal Apparently the building was built in  originally as a warehouse  Later according to one of the staff it was the quotInformatiquequot building for the University of Quebec  The recent conversion to a hotel was done superbly Valet parking is    Our van and many other vehicles were parked in the building in a clean dry heated garage  The central location is excellent  The neighborhood is upscale and safe  Its within easy walking distance of two Metro stops  McGill and Square Victoria  The Montreal Underground is accessible from either stop which we appreciated given the rainy weather while we were there This place is just great  If you can get a room here do not hesitate 
P => Great stay at Le Square Phillips I recently stayed at the Le Square Phillips Hotel for  nights  I read all the glowing reports from other travellers and was amazed that this place lived up to all of them  The staff was wonderful making sure I got a room earlier than normal  They were friendly courteous and always helpful with directions reservations etc  The rooms were impeccably clean and the amenities plentiful It is in a great location really close to everything including the Metro  The high ceilings were fantastic and the dramatic lighting highlighting the columns was certainly a unique touch  Prices were very reasonable also I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Montreal and would stay there again  
P => Great place to stay At the risk of spoiling a good thing e g  making it become too popular I can give highest praise to this hotel for people who like to have a large room with kitchen or even larger suite very clean very good location at a very reasonable price and a very helpful staff  The breakfast is quite sufficient in a large dining room read some comment that it is small but in fact it is quite large so be they made it bigger  The deli type restaurant off the lobby is convenient for afternoon tea and is open until about PM and also has some convenience grocery and drug store type items  We did not use the pool or small exercise room but they were good the pool is inside and looks out over nearby buildings  There is also an outside sun k up there We did walk to and from the historic area a couple of times on the way back there is about a two block uphill climb and the old town itself is fairly large area so you should be able to do a fair amount of walking unless you use a taxi  One comment is that the beds in our room were very firm  
P => Great Place Great location For a very competitive rate and a great location right off St  Cathrines I can highly reccomend this place  We where given a giant king bed full kitchen large bathroom etc   all spotless clean and modern  Very friendly staff  
P => Exceeded Expectaions Le Square Philipps has a great location My husband and I walked to museums shopping and the old town too  We found it to be a very clean tasteful and quiet hotel  A friendly and helpful staff were always ready with directions and dinner suggestions  And    e mail was available and complimentary  We look forward to a future stay to continue our exploration of Montreal 
P => Great Location wonderful units I just returned from a Fall Foliage trip with a good friend  Both of us brought our senior citizen Mothers  We stayed at one of the  bedroom deluxe suites  The unit was huge with high ceilings and huge windows on the corner of the building  It was lovely and excellent for both generations  The only downside was  bathroom for the  bedroom unit  Great location right in the middle of the shopping area on St  Catherine street Rates were quite reasonable too  
P => We will be back We have been vacationing in this wonderful city for many years and have stayed at many hotels  This hotel has been our best experience yet Great location off Catherine Street in the heart of the city  Clean quiet amp comfortable large room w kitchen  Continental breakfast served each day on the nd floor try the delicious Montreal style bagels with free newspaper  Great little fitness room w small pool  Handy deli style shop on the lobby floor  We will be back 
P => Great Vacation We live in Cancun Mexico i had my vacations coming and my teenage dhter wanted to go to the Backstreet Boys concert we where there  nights so before the concert we took some toursvisited museumsdid some shopping and since i like to walk walked the city we had a great time the concert was Excellent so my dhter enjoyed every minute of it my wife joined us a few days later so i visited Quebec for the day while they did more shopping great time of the year to visit Montreal and the Square Phillips Hotel what can i say i am an hotelier myself and they run this hotelvery well great bell boy and front desk staff very professional well managed clean  hr  internet free  my dhter loved it walking distance to movies museums shopping restaurantssupper ket on sunday we went to mass walked a block and a half to a beautiful church We enjoyed the pool sun kgym and even did some laundryNext visit to Montreal Square Phillips Hotel 
P => Excellent Hotel My husband and I just returned from a weekend stay at this hotel in Montreal  It was absolutely wonderful  The hotel was even better than we expected after reading about it on Trip Advisor  We went to Montreal to celebrate our th wedding anniversary  We arrived at the hotel at noon and were able to check in at that time  The staff was extremely helpful the room was beautiful and huge  We stayed in the studio room  The k on the roof was awesome and the pool was also very nice  This is an excellent hotel in a great location  It is less than a block off St  Catherine Street which is a main road in Montreal  It is very close to several nice restaurants and is close to Old Montreal as well  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone from a couple looking for a romantic getaway to a family  
P => Brilliant Great Place This is retrospective as it was some time ago   we stayed here but it was everything the reviews on here advised so I think we owe it to comment because we probably wouldnt have stayed in or even heard about Saint Phillips if it wasnt for the reviews here This was the hotel that made TripAdvisor essential for us The location is brilliant The rooms are hugely fantastic with fridge microwave etc etc etc and are very attractively finished really very st The friendliness of the staff stood out great   although we found Canada to be like that generally I cant quite recall the price but it was very competitive a real bargain for what we got and that is why we would unreservedly recommend this hotel it is simply fantastic  Enjoy 
P => One Of The Best Hotels I must say as a frequent traveler this hotel is one of the best  The entire hotel from the lobby to the roofs pool k workout area are far above expectations I stayed in a BR suite and have rave reviews The rooms are huge and always kept fresh and clean  I would recommend this property to anyone who is seeking a friendly and courteous environment This staff is to be commended  They are by far the most helpful in any situation  They are professionals who anticipate their guests requests  Everyone willing to assist no matter the situation  A team who actually go the quotextraquot mile  The Le Square Phillips is a friendly residence where I would return without question  
P => Great place The reviews are say it all  No wonder this place is ranked so high the place has great location BIG comfortably rooms and a friendly outgoing staff I traveled to Montreal with my parents and wife  I reserved two rooms a ior suite and a studio  So I can speak of both types of rooms THE HOTEL Le Square Phillips has a small but clean and efficient lobby  The  studio  room was huge and equipped with a full kitchen a spacious bathroom and a cavernous sleeping area  I joked with my wife that I could actually run across the room it was that big The  ior suite  that my parents stayed in was even bigger  The suite was also equipped with a full kitchen a spacious bathroom and a bedroom  The room also had a large common area with two armchairs a sofa and a desk with a chair  This was great as we gathered here for drinks and to plan the next day  The suite also had a large walk in closet to keep baggage and coats We were all amazed with size of both of the rooms  The rooms were newly orated and were clean  Cleanliness is important to us  The rooms do have an industrial feel to their orations and furnishings  It is not a quaint bed amp breakfast type place  We still loved it  Incidentally the kitchens have four place settings The breakfast is complimentary and satisfying  As others have noted it has breads muffins croissants cereal juices coffees fruit salad and chocolate milk  It made for a good start THE LOCATION Le Square Phillips is perfectly situated  It is approximately a  minute walk from the street of Ste Catherine which has great shopping and an abundance of restaurants  It is approximately a  minute walk from  Old Montreal  about  minutes to the Art Museum and a good  minutes to the heart of Mont Royal Park We felt safe in and near the hotel  Montreal is a quiet city THE STAFF The staff was quick to help with check in luggage the car the taxis recommending restaurants serving the rooms  We were very pleasedOVERALL You simply can t beat the price for the room location and service  This hotel gets my highest recommendation  
P => Fabulous Suite Hotel in Center of Everything Le Square Phillips is right off Phillips Square in the heart of downtown Montreal  The hotel is walking distance to virtually everything there is to see with the exception of the Olympic Stadium Metro stations are a quick jaunt  We stayed in a one bedroom suite our  nieces in the family suite  Both suites are HUGE  erate kitcheneating area family room area with TV and bedroom with TV  Full size fridge microwave small dishwasher complimentary coffee no minibar  Mattress on sofabed was wonderful Breakfast was in a spacious room with the usual offerings cold cereal juice fruit croissants scrumptous bagels toast etc  Hotel staff very friendly and helpful  Hotel clean efficient maid service  Complimentary safe provided behind front desk  Would stay here again  
P => Amazing Suites We have stayed at this resort twice this summer and found the suites extremely stylish spacious and beautiful  You simply will not find a hotel room like this for the price  It is more like an apartment with a full kitchen living room in the ior suites and huge bathroom  You actually want to spend time in your room here and its in a very central location  For  cdnnight for a ior suite it cannot be beaten   most other resorts in downtown montreal charge this for a run of the mill room with a bed  You will not be disappointed 
P => A great place to stay We found Le Square Phillips on tripadvisor com and were so grateful that we chose it  We ided to sign up on tripadvisor com because it was so helpful  It was clearly the best deal for Montreal hotels and it did not disappoint The hotel is central for all activities  St  Catherine Street the main street bounds one side of the Phillips Square  The underground city and metro system are less than a block away  The old city Vieux Montreal is a  min walk as is Mont Royal the mountainpark The room    the smallest the hotel offers    was anything but small  We had a king size bed a full kitchen with four dining sets large fridge amp freezer ample closet space and a large bathroom  Everything was clean and nicely orated  The hotel has a beautiful indoor pool and outside k on the roof and an exercise room that was smallish but not busy Continental breakfast included was among the best of any hotel weve visited  There is a small delirestaurant on the ground floor but they close at pm we did not try the restaurant  As for the staff they were courteous and helpful in English amp French  There is a small business center downstairs as well as free high speed internet in the room if you bring a laptop The service was not that of a luxury hotel but it isnt necessary unless you really need to be indulged  We enjoyed discovering the city on our own and this hotel more than met all of our needs For dinner the area doesnt have a lot to offer but Crescent Street to the west and St  DenisPrince Arthur to the east are full of options  min walk or  min metro ride in either direction All in all a terrific hotel and great value We paid around night  tax CAN in early tember  If you are a not a resident of Canada the government of Canada will refund the federal tax GST on your hotel bill which is   if you fill out a one page form known as Tax Refund for Visitors to Canada this applies to any hotel as well as merchandise you buy  
P => Rave Reviews are True The hotel is great  The rooms are huge with high ceilings and full facilities   refrigerator microwave toaster dishwasher stove dining table  Free high speed internet connection  Staff was friendly and helpful  We had a  bedroom suite   king bed in one bedroom double bed in nd bedroom and a pullout sofa   for a family of four  We paid night during Labor Day week  
P => Great Hotel Just had  days in Montreal at this hotel based on the reviews and it more than lived up to our expectations We arrived by train and the hotel was a  dollar with tip drive away We booked the hotel direct and got a good rate because we took the no cancellation option Based on the reviews we booked a ior suite and were allocated room  on arrival It is the biggest room you could imagine The kitchen had a fridge freezer dishwasher microwave etc and a table with seating and settings for  The walk in cupboard included iron and board and was great storage for cases etc Large bathroom with bath and shower The living area had  setees and there was a tv in this and the bedroom Included was a buffet breakfast which could be busy at times but there was enough variety to please most folks and endless coffee A short taxi ride to the pedestrianised Rue Prince Arthur east off Boul St Laurent will give you all the resteraunt choices you need and has plenty of atmosphere We ate at several including the Muzerka which was good value If we visit Montreal again we will book this hotel 
P => The place to stay in Montreal I would recommend this hotel to anyone   whether you are a tourist business traveler family traveling with children solo couple student  The rooms are the most spacious I have seen and even come with quite well appointed kitchens and the price is unbelievable for what you get  The hotel is very clean the staff at the front desk helpful and friendly the breakfast spread plentiful and the location central to the metro the train station shopping and the old town  The pool and k are nice relaxing areas and afford views of the city  After my stay here in y  I wouldnt stay anywhere else in Montreal  
P => what a gem We stayed overnight here with our three teenaged sons and cannot rave enough over this hotel  The two bedroom suite was very generously sized and the beds were great  It was clean as could be and when we called down for an extra cot it was delivered within minutes  The staff were very pleasant and the complimentary breakfast was an added perk particularly for such an affordable price  The hotel was very well located particularly for the University and restaurant districts and we will most definitely stay there again when in Montreal  This hotel deserves the reviews it is receiving 
P => Terrific hotel We stayed at the Square Phillips ust  through  with our two kids  We had a one bedroom suite that was HUGE  It is really a one bedroom apartment  Lovely bathroom king sized bed in the bedroom  Ample closet space with shelves in both rooms  erate climate controls in each room  The staff was great  Very nice breakfasts  Within two blocks of two different subway lines  Our teenager appreciated the  hour business center with free internet so she could check her email etc  There is a little cafe adjacent to the lobby with very good Italian food snacks etc  The night my husband and I went out to dinner alone we took the kids downstairs to pick up dinner first  They offered to make cheese ravioli instead of meat even though it was not on the menu  And one of girls working there said she would bring it up to the room when it was ready  This place works like room service for hotel guests  Very convenient  We would stay here again anytime  
P => A great hotel choice My husband and I spent one night here based on reviews I had read  This hotel lived up to all the rave reviews already posted here  The spacious rooms high ceilings cleanliness continental breakfast good value and amenities made it a terrific choice for a visit to Montreal  It is especially nice to have a kitchen area arate from the sleeping area  We highly recommend the Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites  
P => Top flight space and service This hotel is everything previous reviews say  The high ceilinged rooms are enormous and so are the windows  If you get a  bedroom youll have a better view and more windows  The hotel was spotlessly clean during our  day visit and the staff could not have been more accommodating whether fetching the car making dinner reservations or loaning umbrellas  The location a half block off Rue St  Catherine makes it easy to shop eat or just people watch  If you like to walk many attractions are within easy reach  Combining all that helps make a visit to this vibrant city seem like a return to a familiar place  I cant imagine a better big city hotel experience for the price  Or be any price  
P => Great value I go to Montreal quite often but made this trip with my wife  children and  year old mother in law who has always wanted to see Montreal  Stayed in a HUGE suite for a price comparable to room at some other establishments  This is a wonderful hotel  Spotless rooms incredibly high ceilings and a very nice daily breakfast  Good computer access and a nice pool too  
P => good for families I booked a ior Suite for one night   with my two teenagers  The bill was  CDN  tax quotsuper specialquot on Travelocity The room was huge and had a high ceiling  feet  Everything was new and clean  Bathroom had smooth granite look counter  Kitchen had nice IKEA style cabinets dinnerware teacoffee fridge stove microwave and dishwasher  Living room had dining table with  chairs armchair desk TV and pull out couch I slept well on it  Bedroom had a queen size bed and another TV  We got a rollaway bed for my son  There was easily enough room for  rollaway beds  Window overlooked big parking lot behind hotel so you  want to ask for a room with a better view  The free continental breakfast was good Location is excellent    easy twenty minute walk south to Old Montreal  For shopping go west from the hotel on St Catherine  My dhter  had most shopping success at Simons at Mansfield  We liked Le Commensal vegetarian buffet at McGill College  For those who are addicted there is a Tim Hortons one block south of the hotel  If you are hardy you can also walk east on St Catherine to St Denis    it is  short blocks but there were street youth and vocal pan handlers so the subway might be a better choice  
P => Wonderful Montreal Hotel Stayed here for two nights in ust with two boys  and   We had a ior suite on the th floor  The room was enormous much larger than my last NYC apartment which we all had a good lh about  The room was very clean bright and comfortable  Full kitchen including microwave range and dishwasher  Living and bedroom areas both had individual thermostat controls Breakfast was great and they let us all go down and bring whatever we wanted back up to the room The boys really loved the hotel and the city Although the location is not inconvenient   Metro is about  block walk Old Montreal and the river are about a  minute walk   we did find ourselves doing quite a bit of walking The concierge was very helpful and always pleasant  We parked in the hotel garage which was convenient and reasonably priced  
P => This place is great My husband and I stayed at the Le Square Phillips Hotel for  nights and had a wonderful time  We arrived early on a Sunday and they let us check in at  first good thing  The room was very nice high ceilings and quite large plenty of space  Nice kitchen area  It was very clean all the time we were there  There is a pool on the top floor which is very nice and you can sit up there and see the city  The breakfast was good all kinds of food such as cereal breads muffins and bagels  Coffee and juices too  It kept us going for most of the day  And the most important thing was the staff they were so nice and pleasant and willing to help no matter what you needed  Excellent We did need to ask them all kinds of things as we were not familiar where everything was in Montreal they even gave directions on the map for us  Parking was very easy too car went into the garage most of the time while we were there when we did need it it was ready in less than  minutes  Most everything is near enough to walk to and if you need to go other places the Metro is great it goes everywhere  All in all we had a great time here and will come back again for sure  
P => Best Hotel of Montreal This  possibly be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in  The hotel is in a great location right across the street from a historic square and next to Ste  Catherines street a shoppers paradise  It is also only a short  minute walk to the Old City  The hotel is pretty big at to floors  Our room was the  bedroom suite and it was enormous  I live in NYC and I can tell you this room would sell for more then a million  The two bedrooms were huge there were two TVs plenty of closets the windows stretched right up to the ceiling offering spectacular views there was a complete kitchen that even had a dishwasher and the was a large table pre set for two  The other rooms in the hotel are equally as great  Our friends had a room with two beds  You would be suprised at how great it was  It too had a fully equiped kitchen and it was much larger then the typical hotel room with two beds The entire staff was great  They would tell us restruant recomendations and how far it would take to walk to attractions  They would call a taxi for us and it would arrive in a minute  The housekeeping staff was just as good  They were unbelievably neat  They would even do the dishes and put everything back into its original place  The amenities of the hotel include the pool which is on the top floor offering great views of the skyline  Next to it is the exercising room which was fully equiped and even had a TV  Then outside of the pool area was a long balcony with lounge chairs  It was the perfect place to relax after a long day with a great view  On the first floor of the hotel next to the lobby is a cafedeli  They had plenty of snacks drinks and other foods you could take up to your room  Then even had dinner specials  This hotel will make your trip to Montreal as memorable as mine was  Tripadvisor showed me how great this hotel was and they couldnt have been more right  
P => Mom and teenager loved this hotel We selected this hotel for a one week stay starting  based on location and the comments posted on TripAdvisor  All the glowing comments that we read are absolutely true Perfect location it is within a couple of blocks of the La Reine Elizabethcentral train station  Metro stop for one of the main subway lines is just a block or so away    thats McGill  The Victoria Square metro stop is about two blocks away downhill and on a arate line  That covers wherever you want to go thats near a metro stop including the botanical garden olympic stadium La Ronde amusement park St  Denis area etc Place Jacques Cartier and Vieux Port arent really near metro stations but are walkable from hotel  We usually did cabs for these locations about  to  CAD including tip a bargain Yes the rooms are huge and very nice  Service is nice  Continental breakfast has no hot food but good bagels croissants fruit salad good coffee with real creamer different juices etc  Downtown this is worth around  to  per person every day so we were NOT complaining  Adjoining the hotel is a nice deliconvenience store with hot italian food good sandwiches to order good minor groceries and sundries of the type useful if you are in an apartment hotel like this milk butter cold cuts soft drinks individual beers and wines laundry supplies etc  Right next to the hotel on the square are several restaurants with terrace seating  A good moderately priced french restaurant a mid level italian restaurant that also has pizza an interesting noodle restaurant that we just didnt make it to and a Second Cup Montreals Starbucks just steps away and sit outside if the weathers nice Immediately across the street from the hotel is a bank with ATM located in an indoor vestibule  Right around the corner on St  Catherine a two minute walk you find a full sized pharmacy that carries everything the little deliconvenience store doesnt have  Next to that is a Future store which offers one hour photo processing from film memory cards whatever youve got  They also sell any type of battery or phone recharger that you  have forgot  Just past the Future store is a movie theatre All along St  Catherine in either direction is just about any sort of retail shopping that you  be interested in  I noticed the hoochy coochy places that a reviewer mentioned    they are just typical downtown business man types of things nothing overt and certainly not any kind of red light district from any stretch of the imagination One half block away on St  Catherine is The Baie Hudson Bay Company upscale dept  store  This is also a gateway to the McGill metro station a shopping mall and the underground city  At rack rate but with weeks stay discount we loved this hotel and thought it to be a bargain at  CAD per night We stayed one night at the La Reine Elizabeth for proximity to train station  It was beautiful and quite fancy but at  CAD no breakfast Id choose Square Phillips again with absolutely no hesitation In sumy this is a well located squeaky clean well priced hotel that has every travel amenity imaginable within one block  It is not touristy nor is the neighborhood  We loved it  
P => LOVED this great small hotel  a GEM  and a huge value We booked Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites for a  day visit to Montreal  We needed a suite with a arate bedroom with door for us and comfortable sleeping accommodations no air mattresses on the floor for three  year old girls  We had a moderate budget and despaired of finding anything in our price range in a large city such as Montreal  By a stroke of luck we found Trip Advisor and we will never again plan a trip without it and through the reviews of Montreal hotels we found Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites  The reviews raved about the rooms location value for the price free breakfast cleanliness staff friendliness service etc  Upon the advice and after calling the hotel to speak directly with a representative we had a lot of questions and he was completely helpful courteous and patient as were ALL the desk clerks during our stay we booked for y  through   We reserved what they call a family suite two sleeping areas one a arate room with a door very comfortable king bed TV huge closet and the other a double bed in a semi private area of the main room   open to the main room on one side and walled on two sides with a frosted glass and wood panel for the third wall  There was also a sleeper sofa in the living room  The suite was huge the size of an apartment with contemporary furnishings large windows high ceilings some lovely architectural columns with lighting to enhance them and a soothing color scheme  Beside the sleeping areas and living room there was a full kitchen with  seater table  The kitchen is beautifully clean and equipped with everything you would need to cook and serve if you wished to do so we didn t  Also has a full coffeetea service with a thermal carafe coffee pot and fast heating electric teakettle  The creamer is the powdered kind but if you plan ahead bring up some individual creams or a container of milk from breakfast and keep it in the fridge   The bathroom is also enormous and seems to be fully set up for handicapped access  We had originally asked for a two bedroom suite but the reservation agent we called the one mentioned above suggested this as a more affordable alternative and it was perfect for us and fit better into our budget  The family suite was  Canadian per night with our AAA discount which netted down to about  USD  A stretch for our budget but a great price for what we needed and we discovered it was an enormous bargain for what we receivedThe housekeeping was perfect with only a small glitch in the beginning only four towels for five people and the coffee we used was not replaced the first day but after we left a note every other day was perfect  They even accommodated us on a very late room cleaning when my husband had an emergency at work that kept him on the computer and in the room most of the day  At his request the housekeeping staff cleaned around him and they respected his need to work whispering and working very quietly  Ask for a view of the park there is a pretty square with trees and lights and jewelry artisans selling their wares  Be sure to check out the rooftop pool small but pretty and immaculate also heated and glass enclosed and the terrace comfortable lounge chairs and a view of the square a large gothic church and some beautifully lit city buildings very pretty and peaceful at night  There is also a small but well equipped fitness center near the pool area There is a bountiful free breakfast with an enormous selection of breads muffins croissants cereals fruits and beverages in a very spacious and comfortable area on the nd floor  However if you are counting carbs you ll need to pack your own protein sourcesWe drove to Montreal and when we arrived at the hotel we had the hotel park the car in their indoor garage and retrieved it only to drive home parking is   a day Canadian Dollars you might find cheaper parking but we didn t think it was worth the hassle  We purchased weekly Metro cards for  each and so had unlimited access to the Metro and busses during our stay  There is a metro stop only a few blocks away McGill and you can take that three stops east to a major transfer point Berri UQAM to purchase the weekly tickets  The agent at the McGill stop allowed my husband to travel through at no charge since he did not sell the weeklies at McGill  The Metro is VERY easy to use and navigate clean and fast  The most we had to walk from a Metro stop to get to a destination point was perhaps  or  blocks  If you like to walk much of what you will want to see is within walking distance including Old Port a     minute walk southeast  My teens were tired after our Old Port day so we took the Metro back  My husband walked back and he made it to the hotel before we did The hotel is located in a major shopping area near McGill University  St Catherine Street is just north of the hotel and if you head west you ll find a lot of shops and restaurants including entrances to at least two sections of the underground shopping malls huge  Eaton Place is the biggest and is about four blocks west of the hotel on the north side of the street  Heading east on St  Catherine s is not as good   gets a bit seedy There is an abundance of reasonably priced food in the area from the burger chains to great ethnic food super Lebanese place next to the hotel and one in the food court of the underground shopping nearby  The hotel has a small eat in type of deli but with tablecloths The food is reasonable delicious and huge portions  If you like great vegetarian food there is a terrific buffet restaurant Le Commensal on St  Catherine s Street turn west onto St  Catherine s  and walk about  blocks  The restaurant is on the second floor southwest corner  If you ask the concierge they are also great  especially Alex he can give you the exact street  Le Commensal also has a location on Rue St  Denis in the Latin Quarter take the Metro to Beri UQAM and walk north a few blocks on St  Denis  As we were with three teens we didn t do any night life but we passed many cafes and clubs playing great music into the night especially in the Latin Quarter on Rue St  Dennis and on Crescent Street about  blocks west of the hotel between St  Catharine St  and Ave  Masonneuve  We took the girls to a late dinner at the Hard Rock Caf  their choice not ours on Crescent  pm on a Friday night late for us but average dinner time for Montreal and when we came out they got a real taste of a bustling Friday night club crowd wild But safe the streets are packed with people and lit like day with club after club and caf  open to the air and spilling with revelers  A blast to just watch Other things to do the week we were there Montreal hosted three festivals the Comedy Festival you MUST see the street performances especially the main events amazing the international fireworks competition Wed and Sat nights at La Ronde amusement park these fireworks were beyond description the best we ve ever seen beyond worldclass  Pay a bit extra with your La Ronde admission for reserved seating there is as much to watch at eye level with these as there is in the air  and the world swimmingdiving competitions  We missed those for lack of time but saw two nights of the comedy festival and saw the fireworks twice also Wed at La Ronde and Sat from the city also beautiful just not the same as seeing them close up We also took a Gray Line sightseeing tour so we could take in as much of the city as possible we did the six hour tour with four stops with three teens tired from a late night a La Ronde the day before it was too long for their tolerance  However there is a three hour tour and that would probably have been a wiser choice  Our driver was Henri and he spoke non stop in French and English for most of that time   his information was fascinating  We took a boat tour for an hour around the harbor hoping for the same type of guide but were very disappointed  The scenery was great and the harbor interesting but the guide spoke little and it became just a scenic cruise  I don t know if all the tours are like that or if we were just unlucky  The boat company was Le Bauteau Mouche  Some other things To save some  look for  Passport  books at the information counters in the underground malls  There are lost of coupons in there  However we found that the La Ronde coupons were not honored on Fireworks days and that the coupons for the boat tour were not accepted since the hotel had made reservations for us  We were told that they would take them but that we d have to ask the hotel for a refund on the reservations seemed a bit weird so we just passed on the coupons Like other cities there seem to be homeless people everywhere in Montreal and the hotel s area of the park and St  Catherine s St  is no exception  People do beg and seem to be a bit more aggressive about it than they are in New York City but there are so many people around that you don t feel unsafe  It is a bit unsettling at first but you do get used to it  Exchanging USD to Canadian is easy as there is a bank across the street from the hotel they gave the best exchange rate   transaction fee  We reversed the process to exchange CD to USD the day we went home but since it was a Sunday we had to use an exchange store  The rate is not as good but not bad  There are exchange Change stores all over the city Crossing the border on the Canadian side was easy and fast on a Tuesday afternoon about  pm  Getting back into the USA on Sunday at noon was rough   a nearly two hour wait at the border  It was a great trip in great part because of a great hotel  We re planning to return in a year or two for the Jazz festival and will be sure to book the Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites for that trip and any others to come  
P => Great reviews were right on Visited Montreal in mid y and spent several afternoons reading reviews and comparing prices for city hotels  After much contemplation we ided on this hotel  The reviews were all so good that I was worried my hopes would be too high  However in this case the reviews were right on  The hotel staff were very accomodating and friendly the location quite central and easy access to the underground the room was VERY clean spacious and the kitchenette very useful and parking could not have been more convenient hotel valet or public lot right next to the hotel  My husband son  year old dhter  month old and I had a great stay  I recommend this hotel to everyone  You get more than you pay for 
P => Stop looking  This is the place to stay in Montreal  We loved our stay at the hotel when we visited the  Jazz Festival  The location is superb  Walk from the quiet street directly outside and  minutes later youre right in the middle of Rue St Catherine shopping at The Bay department store or the Underground    minutes away is Rue Sherbrooke and McGill U or Place des Arts amp the Jazz festival    minutes south is Chinatown and Old Port while   minutes north is the PlateauSt DenisSt Laurent district with many boutiques and dining possibilities  The studio room with bed dining table  equipped kitchen is HUGE and has a bit of style with high accent lit ceilings  The arate bathroom is modern and large  An included continental breakfast served on the nd floor in a windowed seating area is convenient  The rooftop has a tiny enclosed pool and a handful of excercise machines  The adjacent small outdoor terrace is a pleasant place to catch the summer sun The front desk and bell staff were friendly and eager to assist  It was an excellent value at the AAA  studio price of C wo taxes Strike select hotel off your list of to dos  This is the one  
P => Great Hotel   And We Found It Thanks to Trip Advisor I second the y th  review completely Wonderfully large rooms in fact the gems if you can get one are the two bedroom family suites which include an additional bed in an alcove rather than a enclosed bedroom but they are priced closer to a one bedroom  We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded upon arrival  All interactions with the desk and bell staff were great Do get to breakfast before  or the food selection reases  Not hungry yet or everyone in your party not awake Use the tray in the room its under the coffeemaker to bring back crossants and juice Yes finding the hotel the first time is a trick  Not only are portions of the street on some signs and some maps called Phillips or Beaver Hall or Aylmer but between am and pm weekdays you cant make a left off Rene Levesque Boulevard onto the street and the Alymer portion is one way the wrong way  After three circle the area tries we lucked into approaching it from ther east where a right turn is permitted  The desk staff seemed surprised about the traffic restrictions so be this is a traffic pattern change  But find it and it will be worth it  
P => wonderfl experience Our family of four just returned from a brief trip to Montreal  After researching many hotels we ided to stay at Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites  What a wise choice We were greeted by a friendly staff  The room was very spacious and clean  We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a king size bed in one bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room  The suite had a fully equipped kitchen  The location was great  Close to everything but quiet at night  We found the hotel staff to knowledgeable and very accommodating  The only negative experience was finding the hotel as the street which it is on has three different names  We will definately visit this hotel again  
P => Nice Hotel But Location Not So Great We found Le Square Phillips to be spacious modern and very clean  We spent  per night plus tax for a family of four    a little pricey  We were disappointed in the area that the hotel was located  Only a couple of blocks from the hotel are XXX related businesses and shops on St  Catherine  Old Montreal is within walking distance but it is a   minute distance  While for the most part the staff was friendly and accomodating one clerk gave us a restaurant recommendation whereby we walked out of the establishment prices were very expensive when we had asked for a very reasonable but good location  Other clerksbell staff were uncertain when we asked for restaurant recommendations  There is a nice indoor parking garage on the second floor of the same hotel for C a day  The breakfast is included muffins toast cereals fresh fruit and is at least average but nothing special  Dont arrive late or you will find little  The pool and exercise facility looked very nice but we did not use  I would consider staying here again but we came across other hotels in nicer locations that I would at least check out and research before making another reservation  
P => Unbelievable Thanks TripAdvisor I searched all the usual suspects hotels expedia etc   for lodging for our family of  possibly  people and learned wed need two rooms at any of the chain hotels  Did a google search for quotfamily friendly hotels in Montrealquot  Trip advisor dot com came up and I began reading reviews about quotSquare Phillipsquot  I went to their website and looked a little further  We took a two bedroom suite which had one king bed and one queen a living area with a pull out dining area and kitchen  When we arrived all of us couldnt beleive how huge our room was  Just amazing I think it was over  square feet  If you have a family this is the place in Montreal for you to stretch out and not be stumbling over all the kids and their stuff  Theres dining within a few paces as well as shopping and the Metro all within an easy walk  The value I thought was superb when you compare the cost to two regular rooms in this locale  We paid CN plus taxes just under US per night saving us about US per night for two regular hotel rooms  You pay additional to park most other hotels charge too  This will be my choice again when visiting Montreal  Thanks again Tripadvisor and all the folks that posted about this hotel  Thank you too to the staff for making our stay a memorable one 
P => We loved the Phillips Square We selected this hotel based on the reviews we read on TripAdvisor com  We were so happy that our stay there turned out to be as good as expected  The room we stayed in was one the smallest offered and yet its the biggest hotel room we have ever stayed in  The staff was friendly and quite helpful  The hotel also offers a free safe box and computers with internet access if you dont bring your laptop  The hotel is also conveniently located near the main attractions in the city  And for those places that you want to visit and located relatively far you can take any of the metro stations near by there are about four within walking distance  Theres also a grocery store about two blocks away where you can buy your own food and save money  The hotel also offered free continental breakfast which was quite good considering its a hotel and not a bed and breakfast place  We trully enjoyed it 
P => Excellent Incredible Suite My wife and I and two dhters ages  and  stayed here over Memorial Day weekend  and this place was truly terrific  We had a one bedroom suite with a door to the bedroom One dhter slept on a pullout sofa in the living room and the other slept on an aero bed which we travel with  This suite was indeed quite large and the kitchen area was very handy for leftovers from meals  And the suite was sparkling clean as others have written  The location was also excellent with the following quotclarificationsquot but in no way intended as criticisms first of all while a great city to walk in large part Montreal is still a large city so a hotel in any area willl have its pluses and minuses i e  closer to some sites further to others  The walk to the boarder of Old Montreal was about   minutes and then it could take another several minutes to walk to certain sites there i e  Notre Dame Old Port but this was all very manageable  In Old Montreal we particulalry enjoyed Museum of Arcehology a very different and fascinating presentation good for kids  The paid admission to Notre Dame  adults  kids was worth it as the quottourquot was interesting  You can also go during mass times for free but no tour and hear the organ  We are not Catholic but we found the tour interesting and the church beautiful  Jacques Cartier Place has enjoyable street performers and the old government buildings are impressive especially at night  Having said all these postives Old Montreal didnt quite take my breath away but still a quotmust goquot  Also one way to get to Old Montreal is to walk through Chinatown and do that especially the pedestrian mall  very enjpyable and superb Chinese bakeries  Speaking of eating there are several places to eat on the same block as the hotel   a quotfast foodquot Lebanese Meditteranean place which was very good and inexpensive and a bisro Comptoir  which was excellent and gave us the feel of Montreal style eating  Locals go there and the price for dinner was a few dollars cheaper than in some pure tourist areas  More re  location  if you walk out of the hotel and make a right you will quickly come to St  Catherine a major street  If you turn right you will be going in the direction of the Place DArts  However we found that walk to the right to be somewhat unimpressive and and not particularly enjoyable  But there is a dollar store right there if you need anything last minute and a very extensive and reasonably priced quotsouvenirquot store there too  But if you turn to your left you can walk in a very enjoyable commercialbusinesscollege McGill area with plenty of shops and eateries and my wife and I did a lot of walking in that direction including up the side streets  The vegetraian buffet place  Cassolet  was excellent  There is also a neat bilingual bookstore Indigo with a cafe superb cohoolate banana cake where we got a map and we needed one  I am pretty good at acclimating to cities but I found Montreal to be a little difficult to orient perhaps because it is not a grid streets are in French etc  It took the length of our stay for me to get real good at it so Ill be ready next time  But the people are very nice with directions and the cab drivers we also found to be very nice when we had to take a cab  If driving from NYNorthway stop at Quebec tourist center soon after the border to pick up their own guide books and maps More on the hotel the breakfast was very good featuring real Montreal bagels from Fairmount Bakery which is a car ride away but we also went there to take some home the bagels are very good sweet  Also the bread in Montreal is great not only at the bakeries we found  The hotel buffet served store brought bread cinnamon rasin even white which was better than the home made breads we have here in Albany i e  Paneras  I went to a superket to take several loaves home The hotel has valet parking but there is a public lot right next to it for only day on weekend but day or so on week days  And banks right across the street to exchange money and when closed places near by on Ste  Catherine St  In sum we found this hotel to be truly excellent the accommodations cant be beat for a family  P S  Enjoyed the Biodome which you can reach by subway or cab also there are regrettably many homeless persons in all parts of Montreal so if you wish you can get change at the bank to use during your stay  
P => A Terrific Family Hotel My family spent a long weekend at Le Square Phillips Hotel  Our experience was wonderful in all regards  The hotel offers spacious comfortable suites perfect for families with children  The staff are friendly and helpful the included breakfast was delicious and top notch  The location was perfect   close to McGill University shopping movies and museums  All this for a reasonable price   I cannot imagine choosing another hotel in Montreal  
P => The best place to stay in Montreal We absolutely loved the Square Phillips  It is reasonably priced the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the location just off Rue Ste  Catherine is perfect  near restaurants and shopping  We had a spacious studio with a lovely kitchen dinette electric range dishwasher microwave refrigerator  The lighting is gorgeous in the suite  High speed internet is free  I wouldnt stay anywhere else  
P => Really Excellent Just got back from our stay at Le Square Phillips  I was in Montreal on business and my family joined me  We had a  bedroon suite and it was perfect  Spacious very clean and the staff were   frinedly and genuine  Fast internet link to the room was great maid service perfect and the the kitchen area had everything  The pool on the top floor was great to jump in and out of at the end of the day Our  yera old son loved  The gynm there is great too   machines and free weights  Downstairs in off the lobby is a great little bistro which serves great food at great prices and huge portions Fantastic if you dont want to go trudging looking fro somewhere to eat every night  Over the road we went twice to a superbe French restaurat iens   go there The hotel is a  minute walkf from a the underground network of malls and subways and  mins from the main shopping streets of Peel and St Catherine All in all   you cannot do better  We saw the other hotels as we went around by cab Hilton riott  Inter Cont etc and the location of this hotel was jsut far superior and far nicer from the outside too Oh by the way   breakfast was great  served on floor    a manned help yourself set up  I am so glad we satyed here  
P => Highly recommended I really liked this hotel where I stayed for a week recently  Its impeccably clean the staff are friendly the room spacious and the downtown location most convenient  I booked a ior suite which has a kitchen and dining area which is great if you are like me and want your hotel room to feel like home  The only thing you be want to check if a nice view is an essential component of a good hotel room for you ensure you are on the Square Phillips side and not the car park side  Having said that even if you do have a room at the back like we had you can still go up to the roof and see lovely views of the Square and the rest of the city including the leaning Olympic tower  If the weathers nice you can relax on the sun loungers  This hotel is really good value for money and I highly recommend it to business and pleasure travellers alike  
P => Enormous and well appointed suites We stayed at the hotel from il  to   The staff are very friendly and the rooms are unprecedented We had a one bedroom suite which was much more than the two of us needed    a studio suite wouldve been sufficient  Were were quotwowedquot by the suite which has a walk in closet bigger than some bathrooms  The bathroom was spacious and clean  The kitchen included a full size fridge stove oven microwave oven and dishwasher A very nice living area lead to the bedroom which was arated by a frosted glass and wood wall  There are TVs in the living room and bedroom  The king sized bed looked small in the bedroom We estimate that the entire suite was likely close to  sq  ft The   foot ceilings and lots of windows made the place feel spacious A continential breakfast was included and had great baked goods try the bagels coffee fruit cereal and very good juices the grapefruit juice tasted fresh  The gym was a little small but had an assortment of dumbells which ranged up to  lbs which we found rare in most other hotels  The pool and patio area were nice too though we didnt use them The location cant be beat  Only steps away from the Bay department store St  Catherine Street the main street downtown and the quotunderground cityquot shopping galore  If you go down the street towards Rene Levesque Blvd and then turn left theres an IGA grocery store about   blocks  The variety there is great and there are ready to heat meals which are quite good Montreal in general is an awesome city    so much variety and great deals shopping is a must friendly people who switch easily between French and English are helpful people stopped to ask if we needed any directions or ideas on where to visit and service in the hotel and stores care hard to beat  The residents are proud of their city and its evident why  Theyre also however generous in sharing their pride with visitors and helping one to really experience the city As for food    Try Reubens for Montreal smoked meat  Its probably the best place around within walking distance  When you go west on St  Catherines youll see a Reubens on the left side of the street    it looks like it goes downstairs  That one is more of a deli by the looks of things  However if you keep going for a couple more blocks youll see a Reubens restaurant theres smoked meat hanging in the window  Give it a try  Oh and also St  Hubert chicken and ribs are always a treat  Wish we had the chain in BC Id highly recommend Montreal and the Square Phillips Hotel and Suites  The hotel is the best deal and I havent come across such a well appointed suite before especially for the price which was  Can for us  Enjoy your trip   
P => Very helpful staff We enjoyed a thoroughly comfortable stay at the hotel for the duration of a week long conference  On our first night the young man on the desk at Le Square Phillips recommended a restaurant to us which we discovered featured in our conference guide and as a consequence was heavily booked  With great courtesy and a lot of charm he managed to secure us a booking for that night and with only a  minute wait  The restaurant was excellent and his attitude and approach sums up what you can expect from this hotel  
P => Loved it We have just returned from three days at Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites  The hotel is extremely clean and everyone was very friendly and helpful  Breakfast was included each day coffee juice bagels croissants cereal oatmeal fruit etc  and was lovely  The rooms are very large and we couldnt hear anything through the walls which hopefully meant they couldnt hear my  and  year old  Lots of room for them to run around  Full size fridge stove plates utensils glasses   even a dishwasher  Bathroom very clean and good sized Will definately be staying with them again  
P => Le Square Deal Although we only got to stay here for one night last week we loved what we saw  The staff who checked us in were so hospitable and wanted to please  They had a nice business center with free high speed Internet  We did not get to see the pool or fitness center but judging by the rest of the hotel I am sure they were nice  They have three speedy elevators and the hotel was exceptionally quiet  It is located on Square Phillips the one with the statue of King George across the square is Chirst Church Cathedral and The Bay Department Store  with easy access to the underground shopping areas  The Gare Central main train station is within easy walking distance  The Place d Arts the theater complex for symphony opera plays etc  is also within walking distance The Montreal Symphony Orchestra OSM is excellent by the way This location is more central in downtown and nearer to the quotactionquot esp  at night as opposed to the quiet atmosphere found at night in Old Montreal  The room are HUGE and include a microwave stove breakfast table desk and a FULL sized fridge It would be a great place to stay for an extended period of time for a business traveler  What a classy place and an island of solitude and style in downtown Montreal  
P => Excellent hotel excellent location Stayed at Le Square Phillips Hotel in   for  nights  They didnt have the room i requested so they moved me up to another room   well holy cow it was great  I booked a room but was upgraded to a suite  Not sure what suite this is but it was huge Looked out onto Phillips street and could see St  CAtherines from the window also   could see The Bay from the window  There was a arate bedroom with a king size bed big window and a tv and huge closet  There was a queen bed off of the living room and a pullout couch in the living room  Huge dining room with kitchen too  Very clean  Colors were neutral   furnishings were nice   simple but up to date  Bathrom was large and clean  Tv also in the living room  Kitchen had a fridge stove microwave and fully equipped with dishes utensils and a few pots and pans  And some tea coffee  Daily breakfast was served on the nd floornot sure of the floor   serve yourself style  Cold cereal oatmeal juices coffeetea muffins bagels toast cookies fruit  Did the trick just fine  Hotel or was nice and clean and quiet  There was a small cafe in the lobby   looked good but never did eat there  Also internet is available in a small office behind the lobby  Although everytime i wanted to use it seemed that it was occupied  But i eventually got to the computer  Front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants  Good smoked meat deli right next door  Location was very central to everything  Half a block from the heart of st  catherine street  Perhaps a  minute walk to Old Montreal  I have no complaints rather I am sure if i was ever to go to Montreal again i would pick this hotel again  
P => Le Square Phillips Hotel is wonderful and comfortable My family ided on Le Square Phillips Hotel completely based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed  We were there for four nights and with  adults and  children we had a wonderful and very comfortable experience  The suites are enormous and we were happily surprised to be upgraded to a suite with a king size bed in a arate room a living room with a pull out sofa and an alcove with another double bed and a large kitchen area  We have never been so comfortable in a hotel  The included breakfast was more than adequate and my kids loved the beautiful rooftop pool  We would certainly not hesitate to recommend this hotel and cannot wait to visit Montreal for another stay at Le Square Phillips  
P => Wonderful place to stay We just returned from three nights in Montreal and the Le Place Phillips was a wonderful place to stay  We were with our ten month old son and the hotel provided a Graco pack n play can be used as a crib and a high chair for our room  The studio suite came with a kitchendining area and that was very convenient to store baby food wash baby bottles etc  The staff was courteous and helpful  The hotel is in a good location  we were in walking distance to Chinatown Old Montreal and the underground shopping district  The condition of the room was very clean and new  I would definitely stay there again if we visit Montreal  
P => Le Square Phillips Excellence Spent there  days last  and as everyone else I was quite amazed with the size of the rooms which are rekably spacious  Was also very pleased with the stuff attitude and the helpfulness in the front desk  The location is beautiful and I personally think ideal near St  Catharine Street as in fact you are as close in the center as possible yet you totally avoid all the fuss and noise  A very well organized clean and ideally placed hotel in the very heart of Montreal  Strongly recommended  
P => Great location room size  We spent  nights in ember  The breakfast is adaquate  The room was excellent  The size spoiled us and it was great having a kitchen amp frig The front desk helped us look up movie times amp locations amp were friendly amp helpful  It was nice having a internet computer available at no charge although I wish there had been more then one  
P => Huge rooms I travel to Montreal frequently on business and thought I would give the Phillips Square a try  The first thing you notice is the size of the rooms  I stayed in the smallest suite and it was three times the size of a typical hotel room  The room was well equipped with a clean bathroom and nice dining kitcen area  This is very much a hotel for the middle of the road tourist especially families because of the spaciousness  It is not really a hotel for the romantic weekend getaway or your typical business traveller  Parking is very convenientbut the food offerings are essentially limited to the continental breakfast  However there is a splendid restaurant the Restaurant ienonly a few doors away  The overall location of the hotel is reasonably good and very convenient for Ste Catherine Street shopping  There is no way this is the second best hotel choice in Montreal as your rating suggests There are at least a dozen hotels in Montreal that are superior  
P => Will recommend to all of my friends and family We take multiple trips to Montreal each year and have been looking for a great place to stay  Le Square Phillips is in a great location has a great staff and wonderful accomodations  Instead of being cramped in a tiny room Le Square offered high ceiling beautiful rooms with a dining area and kitchenette  The continental breakfast was chaotic and just okay but the rest of the hotel makes up for it ten fold  I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know 
P => Couldnt be more pleased Stayed for  nights in a BR suite which we shared with friends  Huge and beautiful room   ceilings plenty of large windows nice architectural details  zoned temperature controls  We had  adults and  kids and there was plenty of room and sleeping areas  Nice sitting area nice kitchen with stoveovenmicrowavedishwasher and pretty much anything you would need to prepare meals in room large attractive dining area as well  Staff was excellent with maps directions etc  We valet parked and each time we left the hotel the car was ready by the time we hit the lobby  Extra pillows were delivered within  mins of the request  Early check in was allowed  Breakfast was extraordinary given it is complimentary  Choices of cereals breadsbagels croisants juices fruit coffee tea in a very nice dining area  Walking distance to many area attractions and only a few blocks from the McGill Metro station on site laundry facilities although without a soapsoftener vending that I could see nice work out area beautiful roof top outdoor lounging area  The only complaint I would have at all is that the roof top pool was a bit small as well as too deep   ft throughout for small children without floatation aides which I forgot to bring for mine  
P => Loved the Phillips Square We loved our large two bedroom suite at the Phillips Square clean new  TVs great kitchenette  We were adults who wanted to sleep arately and thanks to arate bedrooms with doors and the sheer size of the suite we had lots of privacy  Best of all was the location  We were about  seconds away from the shops on Ste  Catherine Street and McGill subway station less than a  minute walk from Notre Dame Basilica and Old Montreal and in about a half hour we walked to Schwartzs on the quotMainquot for smoked meat  There was a great shop downstairs for groceries  I recommend the Phillips Square and will certainly go on my next trip to Montreal  I cant imagine staying in the suburbs ever again  
P => Great hotel I got the recommendation from Trip Advisor and while I was not the cheapest place in Montreal it is one of the best at any price  For about  per night we got unbelievable service and a huge room  They do charge for parking but there is a place next door that is a little cheaper  Just remember that you have to pay each time you come and go from the parking lot I think  At the hotel it is also valet parking from the front door  The location is also superb if you want to be near downtown and lots of restaurants  Overall just an incredible place and breakfast is included  
P => Superb We just returned from a week at the Le Square Phillips Hotel Suites  It was fantastic   spacious and immaculate rooms delicious breakfasts courteousfriendlycheerfulhelpful staff perfect sightseeing location exceptionally quiet room very clean and convienient laundry facicities  The enclosed roof top poolwas gorgeous   especially at dusk when the city lights came on  It was a superb experience  This is a lovely hotel with very wonderful staff  I am smiling as I write this and think back on our time there  
P => Fantastic experience My husband and I stayed here on a recent vacation and st trip to Montreal  We could not have been more satisfied  The location is ideal    block from St  Catherines   the major downtown shopping street the subway and underground city  We were able to walk to the Latin district Chinatown and Old Town  The rooms are large clean and stylish  The rooftop poolfitness roomoutdoor k was very nice  The staff was very friendly and accomodating  We will definitely stay here again if we return  
P => Great Hotel in an OK city I would have given this hotel  quotstarsquot if it wasnt for the fact that its located in Montreal   needless to say we didnt think Montreal was all that great   however this hotel is awesome   we stayed in a king studio on the top floor   apparently the smallest room they offer and it was huge   a nice size bathroom roomy tubshower combo a full kitchen area which led into the bed area   I do suggest bringing your own pillow though   the bellmenconcierges were all very nice and very helpful   Im very glad I did more research and ended up staying here for  US a night   it was definitely the right choice for the price   especially because the place is only a couple of years old and is very clean   and the maid service was great   she did a wonderful job   dont get too excited about the continental breakfast because if you stay longer than two days it gets old   but there is a small store downstairs that sells all sorts of things   its a cross between a mini tdeli   they have breakfast items they make sandwiches pasta soup and salads for lunch   you could see many locals eating there on their lunch hour   also a good place to pick up some bottled water and some snack food   they stay open until like      the hotels location is good too   its just off of Rue St Catherine which is a main street and about a  minute walk to the Old Port   its not worth taking the subway to Old Montreal because by the time you walk to the subway youre almost in Old Montreal   the subway can be used for getting to other areas although the system is not as expansive as I was led to believe   we had our car which was useful   Montreal is an easy driving city   I wont get into why I didnt like Montreal because I think this review is long enough but I will say that unless you have business there or a specific reason to be in Montreal then I would skip it and go to Quebec City instead   it was so much nicer and had a lot more history   Montreal had a few attractions but nothing major compared to other cities Ive been to   be in the height of the tourist season when there is a festival going on Montreal might be more exciting   I probably wont go back so I wont know  
P => vellous Facility Ive just come back from three days in Montreal  We stayed at Le Square Phillips Hotel and I was very impressed  It is in a central part of the city and allows for easy access on foot to to the old cityand its attractions and the waterfront as well as the newer part of the city its restaurants and bars and McGill  The rooms were so large and spacious the kitchen was of a good size too and very well equipped and the bathroom had lots of counter space  There was so much room for all our luggage and personal belongings  The continental breakfast was also very good  I was able to use the pool and do some sun bathing on the roof of the hotel which was nice after a day of sight seeing  If I ever go back to Monreal I will be sure to book into Le Square Phillips a great deal for its very resonable price  
P => Great location I stayed at Le Square Phillips for seven nights in y  and found most of the comments within tripadvisor to be correct  I had a one bedroomed suite which was enormous both clean and nearly new it was almost too much space for one person  The gym amp swimming pool were adequate if a little on the small side but the general level of service was very good  However there were a couple of points which were not so good  The sound proofing between the rooms was very poor to the extent that I was repeatedly awoken by the next suite who kept rearranging their kitchen furniture on the stone tiles first thing in the morning  Imagine nails scraping on the blackboard and you get the picture  There was also a problem with the TV in the lounge not working which would normally not have been such a problem except for the fact it was a Sunday when the maintenace man did not work either  I did ask reception what would happen if something serious went wrong on Sunday but alas recieved no reply  Also there was no bar at the Hotel which I did not think I would miss but I did  That last convivial drink with fellow guests can be a really nice way to end an evening and make new friends  Finally the price I was quoted over the phone was not the price I was asked to pay upon leaving  The difference amounted to only   per night extra which in real terms is almost irrelavent when compared to the total bill for the stay however that is not how I do business and that is not the point  Overall Im still happy to recomend Le Square Phillips for those who seek space and location with a minimalist feel  
P => loved the Le Square Phillips Hotel Suites fantastic hotel clean good service and grate location 
P => Fabulous   fabulous   fabulous Superb in every way  We had a Studio room    It was huge and beautifully furnished and equiped with everything you need  The breakfast had a huge assortment to choose from  nothing was any trouble   The staff were friendly helpful and polite  The situation of the hotel was central for anywhere you wanted to go and yet the Square is very quietWe found this hotel on this site and would recommend strongly anybody going to Montreal to stay here  You will not be disappointed 
P => An Awesome experience My family of   children stayed at the Square Phillips ust  through ust    We were very happy We had a  bedroom suite and I could not believe the size of it Our kids favorite activity was to play hide and seek in the room  After  days they never tired of finding new places to hide thats how large the suite was I was impressed with how clean our room was it literally sparkled The bathroom was enormous and it was spotless Even the pipe under the sink inside the cabinet was sparkling clean Icouldnt believe it The beds were very comfortable  The windows in our suite were huge They were so tall with big fat window sills  My kids would sit on the window sills and watch the city  There is a great little cafe in the lobby area of the hotel  It sells drinks food great salads sandwiches very convienent Breakfast was served each day on the second floor  It was a great selection of fresh fruit bagels breads donuts cereals pastries etc  Even my  finicky children found something they liked to eat The hotel is in a great location very close to  metro stations  We parked our car when we arrived and did not touch it again until we left  The rooftop pool is small but just fine My  kids loved swimming as the city lights lit up at night all around them  The staff at the Square Phillips is unbeatable They were so friendly and wanted to help in any possible way  They really made our stay so enjoyable  A great big thank you to Sebastian concierge and yann They were the best If we ever visit Montreal again  we will definately stay at the Square Phillips  
P => TripAdvisor Reviews were correct I selected Le Square Phillips for a three night stay ust rd th based on the reviews by past guests on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed  The location downtown is central to everything and a  minute walk from the VIA station  I booked the king studio suite and was surprised by how large it was  square feet or more  There was a walk in closet large bath full kitchen with full sized appliances including stove fridge dishwasher and microwave  There was a arate living room and very large bedroom  So much space and still a very reasonable price  I didnt go with the   or   rated properties as one was a BampB and the second much more expensive than Le Square Phillips Breakfast included toast muffins bagels croissants donuts cereals juices fresh fruit fresh fruit cocktail tea coffee milk   and chocolate and hot chocolate I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a spacious comfortable reasonably priced well run downtown property  If youd rather have the convenience of a full apartment rather than just a hotel room look no further  
P => Nice Hotel Great Location We just spent a weekend in Montreal and stayed at Le Square Phillips and found it to be a lovely property with huge rooms and a very friendly staff  Its located right in the heart of downtown so many quotmust seequot tourist things are right within walking distance  We had a two bedroom suite and I can honestly say that it was bigger than my Brooklyn apartment and my Brooklyn apartment is big compared to other NYC abodes  The bedrooms were large but there was only one bathroom which made mornings a little bit slower than we would have liked  The kitchen was small but very usable with a four burner electric stove with oven a microwave pots pans and dishes a small full size refrigerator and the all important dishwasher  The continental breakfast offered breads and bagels for toasting Montreal bagels are not at all like NY bagels but are really good in their own right pastries and donuts cereals fresh fruit juices tea and coffee  Nothing fancy but enough to get you going  The pool on the roof is very small and kids staying at the hotel dominated it the whole time we were there  But the outside k around the pool was a lovely spot for evening coffee as the sun sets  The work out room is small but very functional with a bicycle treadmill elliptical lat pull down that can be adjusted for other exercises a rowing machine free weights and an adjustable bench  The only complaint and I hesitate to call it a complaint because its so minor is that there was only one trash can in the room in the bathroom if you dont count the teeny tiny trash bag in the kitchen which can hold a tea bag and a paper cup and then its full  For the money it was well worth it and I will most assuredly stay there again  In the past we have stayed at the Saint Sulpice which is superior but this is bigger and more affordable if not as luxurious  
P => Montreal Le Square Phillips We have just come back from a  nights stay at Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites ust  ust   I had basically picked this hotel with my fingers and toes crossed based on all the positive reviews Ive read on tripadvisor  I really was a bit nervous about picking this hotel  First of all Ive never picked a hotel based only on on line reviews especially one Ive never heard of  Secondly not one Montreal tour book Ive looked at listed this hotel as a recommended one actually most of the books did not even have this hotel listed   which normally is probably not a good thing  Anyways once in a taxi in Montreal I figured it was a good sign that when I gave the driver the hotel name he knew exactly which hotel I was referring to  The hotel is about  mins from the Trudeau Airport  The cab ride is a flat fee of CAD  You can charge it if you have not at that point exchanged for Canadian currency although I will say I think the driver will be happier if you pay him in cash  When we pulled up to the hotel I was definitely happy and relieved to see that the hotel looked very nice from out front  The lobby is not big like the Sheratons and riotts of the world but it was very well kept  Check in and check out was taken care of efficiently  The front desk and concierge were very professional friendly and helpful throughout our stay  We had booked a studio room with a king bed  I was amazed as to how big this room was Do not let the term quotstudioquot fool you  Its definitely not the usual size hotel room  For those of you who are familiar with studio apartments in New York City this hotel room is bigger than some of those apartments  Everything looked brand new  I dont think Ive ever stayed in a hotel that looked this new and clean  The kitchen is stocked with dishes and utensils including wine opener and can opener  There is a full size refrigerator which came in very handy for keeping cold drinks and leftovers  There is a full size stove with oven dishwasher toaster microwave oven and coffee maker  The bathroom is very roomy and has very bright lights  The reason I specifically mentioned the bright lights is because the rest of the room is not very brightly lit  It has very modern lighting fixtures which is more for looks than practicality which unfortunatley I think is the trend for the boutique hotels  I found that with the desk lamp and the two night table lamps on it wasnt too horrible  There is a tv but unless you understand French you wont get much use out of it  There are a couple of stations that have English speaking programs but most are in French  Although my husband thought it was entertaining to watch Bart Simpson The Simpsons speak French  The bed was very comfortable nice and firm  I have to have to agree with the other reviewers that the pillows are way too hard It was just better for me to not use it at all  The hotel offers free high speed internet access  If you forget to bring your network cable you can pick one up right downstairsthe one we got was about CAD  There is a computer store adjacent to the hotel  Adajcent to the other side of the hotel is a little deli  grocery store where you can pickup drinks and assortment of munchies  The locale of the hotel is great  On the same block of the hotel is a coffee house similiar to Starbucks a pizza place    not your usual pizza place    they offer over  varieties and a couple of other restaurants  bistros  The Metro is about two short blocks away  Its a very user friendly subway system  Fares are CAD  one way but you can also get daily passes or multiple days passes for discounted rates  We took the Metro to see an Expos game and to the Biodome  Old Montreal is about a    minutes walk from the hotel  We took a taxi to the Casino which was about a     minutes drive  The cab fare was about CAD each way  Rue St Catherine where all the shops are is about a block away  Unless you plan to go outside of Montreal you really dont need a car and note that the hotel charges CAD per day for parking valet  In our wandering we had walked by some of the big name hotels riott Sheraton Fairmont and they dont seem to be as conveniently located  Another thing I found useful is that there is a phone in the lobby that is a direct line to the taxi company  We called and they were in front of the hotel in about  minutes I can probably go on a bit more about this hotel  trip but this review  be too much already  So to sumize this is a really nice hotel and if youre debating whether or not you should book at this hotel     go for it 
P => A really great value for your money We selected this hotel after reading the wonderful reviews  We checked into a kingsize non smoking studio and    all those great reviews were correct  This studio is HUGE   easily the size of  large hotel rooms  I can only imagine the size of the suites  The bathroom is large and the kitchen is complete  Everything is spotless  Staff is very friendly  The outside of the hotel is ok looking but the location is good  Old Montreal is a  min walk downhill  The Metro is  blk away Victoria Sq station and shopsrestaurants is whithin a few blks  Attached to the hotel is a small restaurant that also carries some basic stuff like milk yogurt tylenol etc etc  Very helpful when you have a  yr old kid  The swimming pool is on the top of the hotel and the view from the top is of surrounding buildings  The pool like the rest of the hotel is clean  Im writing this review from the room on the free high speed internet  We are here one more night and loving every minute  Will defintely book this hotel when we come visit Montreal again  be try the even bigger suites     
P => Excellent hotel great value We stayed four days in a one bedroom suite  As other reviews have indicated the rooms including the bathroom are huge and reasonably well appointed e g  good TVs in both living room and bedroom  The staff is very helpful and the location is unbeatable  Also the unlimited high speed Internet access is a real plus The lobby and or are only fair but this is a minor point  The hotel aims to please and it is a terrific value  Breakfast is included so with kids which we didnt have its a real bargain  It is also nice to have the roof pool and workout area  For some reason not many cab drivers know about the hotel and it is not written up in Fodors  In any event we would come back and highly recommend it to others  
P => Excellent Hotel We stayed one night ust   and chose the studio with two double beds  The room was huge and very well set up  We found it exceptionally clean along with the rest of the hotel  The outdoor area on the poolfitnesslaundry floor was fantastic  The complimentary breakfast was very nice with with many tasty items to choose from  All the staff was friendly and helpful Location was perfect and we would not hesitate to book again 
P => Excellent accomadations at Le Square Philips My husband  two children ages  and  and I stayed at Le Square Philips Hotel for two nights and we were quite impressed with the property  The location is excellent within walking distance of the quotmust seesquot in the city  There is a well appointed cafe off of the lobby which has a great selection of every snack sandwich and beverage anyone could want  The lobby is warmwelcoming and well orated in a simple and modern style  Staff is friendly and service is prompt  The one bedroom rooms were huge like one bedroom apartments with high ceilings immaculate and orated in good taste  Everything was brand new  Pool excercise room and k were in great shape  Excellent value and quality Highly reccommened for families and business travelors who need more space in thier accommadations  
P => Absolutely wonderful From the moment we walked in the door until we checked out the staff was absolutely wonderful and exceptionally friendly  It was the biggest hotel room we have ever had and very nicely appointed and very clean  We stayed in a jr suite deluxe and we estimated the room size at  x  feet  Very convenient for shopping and eating  Will definitely stay there again 
P => Central location big rooms nice concierge One of the highlights of our recent trip to Montreal was staying in this hotel  It was reasonably priced and offered a nice clean modern centrally located and friendly place to stay for our extended weekend  The concierge pool and free yummy continental breakfast were great touches  We would definitely come back 
P => Square Phillips was nice location cant be beat The Square Phillips was very nice in most ways  First one could say that its definately one of the best locations of all downtown Montreal hotels  Its located between rue St Catherine and Ren  L vesque Blvd   on a quiet street which means that the suites are also very quiet  Secondly its true the staff is friendly and was one of the most responsive Ive seen ever  Thirdly its suites even the studios are HUGE  They all have a fully equipped kitchen local calls and internet access are free  What kept me from giving it a perfect rating its true If you are used to feather pillows youll find theirs extremely hard  The mattresses were also a little too hard to my tastes  But some of you will like that  The hotel itself is still brand new and it shows but I found that it lacked a bit of personality the rooms and the lobby are orated in dark greyish tones that are a little sad  Not that I dont like art o contemporary or on the contrary but it seems their mix contemporaryclassic did not work that well But that shoudnt stop you from booking I would return there myself also because of their incredible value for price  
P => Totally excellent  Best hotel Ive stayed at      All aspects of this hotel are great Room one bed suite was extremely large with high ceilings  Since building was originally built as warehouse this means that the building is extremely solid and almost no noise from other rooms in contrast to other hotels on our trip  Actually the suite was bigger than my small one bed flat that I rented some years ago All facilities provided as mentioned by previous reviews Free in room high speed internet access although the connector had disappeared into the stupid fancy lamp and had to be dug out Staff very friendly and helpful and do not quothang aroundquot for tips like in regular hotels The attached cafe was very good and was also a small shop containing many useful food items  Nearby IGA superket was excellent Location was brilliant and extremely close to the efficient and cheap metro Pool and laundry excellent  
P => Great  Clean spaceous central nice pool  I spent a week in a  bedroom suite in this hotel  The room has plently of space about m and nice high ceilings  Everything was very clean and in good condition  You get a kitchen with a cooker microwave fridge freezer and a dishwasher  There are clothes washing machines on the top floor  On the top floor is a small gym and a reasonable pool  Neither was very busy at all For food you get a self service breakfast included in the room rate  In the foyer there is a simple cafe  There is a big superket about  blocks away  High speed internet access is also included The location is really good  Its central  blocks from the central train station but on a fairly peaceful road  I was staying with kids aged  and  and it was much nicer than on one of the busy thoroughfares like Sherbrooke For a room rate of CAN  a night we had a really comfortable stay  Highly recommended  
P => Definetly worth it   I wanted to join in on the praise this hotel is receiving  My stay was at the beginning of uary for  nights and on top of being very close to the train station the hotel was above average in almost every category I can think of for this price range We had a  bedroom suite  I gave the king bedroom to a couple took the queen room for myself and we had a pull out sofa and  rollaways for the other guests  The diningliving area accomodated us all reasonably well and the nook kitchen was a nice added bonus for storing wine and making coffee in the morning  There is only  bathroom which is atypical of a  bedroom hotel suite but not at all uncommon for a small  bedroom apartment   which more aptly describes the space  Room was clean and comfortable and maid service was very nicely done  The continental breakfast is a nice touch   especially if you take it back to your room  The breakfast room feels more like a school lunch room than anything but it still more than what would be expected for the price you are paying  Hotel had no problem accomodating my request to hold my bags after checkout until my trains departure time  If you are on a budget but want to stay in a nice place do not hesitate to book this hotel  You will not be disappointed  The staff the suites the location are all equal to the praise offered them in the other reviews ThanksBrian 
P => Wonderful hotel w friendly staff    What a wonderful stay we had  Great location that is close to everything  Rooms are huge and had fully equipped kitchens  The free breakfast was fantastic  I needed x tra pillows due to a last minute foot injury and they were delivered immediately  Very friendly staff  Would recommend this hotel to anyone 
P => Outstanding Le Square Phillips continues to live up to the stellar reviews  Great suites large nicely furnished clean very comfortable and amazingly quiet great staff friendly courteous oh so accommodating great location close to Metro and to shopping on Rue St  Catherine and Underground Montreal easy walk to Chinatown and Le Vieux Port great amenities excellent breakfast lovely pool and rooftop k    dont miss the view great price   
P => Thank You Tripadvisor All that is said is true    This is a great new hotel in the center of Downtown  Highly recommend Thank all of you who contribute to this website and help everyone make the best educated selection  
P => great place I spent a weekend in Montreal and there wouldnt be a better place to stay  Must admit it was hard to find at first not the most obvious hotel in Montreal  I think that is why it is so great  We went in il  I think if the weather would have been warmer the outside k would have been great  The only complaint was because the weather was so cold that weekend the walk to the bars was a little far  The staff was great very friendly  I will not stay anywhere else in Montreal  This is the place  We had  of us there and we had plenty of space  The hotel for the price is incredible  Stay here and you will have a great time  Full kitchen bathroom was bigger then my bedroom at my current house  The pool was awesome looking over Montreal at night  If you are looking for a party hotel this isnt the place for you but dont get me wrong you can still party  There just isnt half naked people running around like some of the other establishments in Montreal Days Inn etc       
P => Simply the Best  This is a wonderful hotel clean quiet beautifully furnished courteous and helpful staff  The rooms are comfortable and have every convenience  The hotel is in a great downtown location  This hotel is a great bargain and a terrific place to stay   dont tell anyone else 
P => Good value What it lacks in excitement it makes up for in value  Nice large rooms  Clean amp modern A great place for a family trip kitchen is a great feature  Good location  Not necessarily what Id choose for a romantic getaway  
P => one more happy visitor Le Square Phillips Hotel fully lived up to its excellent reviews on our two recent stays  The small lobby is inviting and contemporary the staff most courteous and the hotel is exceptionally well maintained  The accommodations are attractive and very large made to seem even larger by the  foot ceilings a feature from its previous life as a warehouse  You can get an excellent meal at ians one block over or a smoked meat sandwich just up the street  The Bay and the Montreal Underground shopping are a block away and we walked from the art museum to Vieux Montreal with our hotel right in the middle of things  More money will buy you more ostentation but not a better place to stay and enjoy this city  
P => Hard to believe but it lived up to the great reviews Spent  days in Montreal and  great nights at this wonderful hotel  First the hotel is in a great location with easy access to the Metro a couple of blocks to two different stations on two different lines  Second the rooms are immaculate well appointed and spacious  While we were there for vacation this would be a great place to stay if you were on business or had an extended stay  Third the hotel staff is outstanding   friendly helpful and courteous  Stephen Antonin Dominic   all of the concierge were awesome  Little things like having a bunch of umbrellas available to the guests is a very nice touch  Everyone was extremely fluent in English overcoming one of our fears of traveling to this province  While we did not make it to the pool it was nice to know that it was available  The Continental breakfast buffet was sufficient  Bottom line the value was outstanding and the hotel was top notch   I highly recommend it to everyone  
P => Great stay Fantastic hotel for longer stays or special diet needs  Each room is more like your own apartment  Full kitchen and super high ceilings  Only downfall is the gym   old equipment and very limited selection  
P => Square Phillips is the BEST The Square Phillips is by far the nicest hotel Ive ever stayed at in Monteal  It is located right in the heart of the city and is within walking distance to everything  The rooms are exceptionally clean and very big  The continental breakfast was very good  The staff were all pleasant and spoke very good English  Even though we were only  block from St  Catherines street it was extremely quiet in the hotel couldnt hear a thing from the outside  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Perfect Weekend We booked this hotel just because of the reviews posted on here  Everything was so wonderful  We had a short walk from the train station  Hotel is in a nice area some pretty churches near by amp shopping too  Staff was very polite amp helpful  They recommended a restaurant arund the corner amp it was also excellent  The one thing that really stood out about this hotel was that is was so CLEAN I dont think I have ever stayed in a hotel as clean amp tidy as this one  Someone posted on here that there werent any snacks in the room for the kids well that shouldnt be a problem there is a nice little cafestore right off of the lobby  They had every snack right there amp beverages also prepared foods amp they made sandwiches too  We cant wait to go back amp we have told several friends about this treasure 
P => Fabulous Located this hotel on the web  Spent  weeks in summer of  y  while on business  Found it to be clean centrally located beautiful rooms  Stayed in a one bed suite complete with a kitchen  The kitchen was great since one does not want to eat out every day for six weeks  Grocery store is a bit of a walk but with a backpack and sneakers I managed easily  I am currently online to book this hotel again for e   
P => You must stay here Fantastic  The photos on their webpage dont do it justice  We stayed in a one bedroom suite that was much bigger than my apartment  Everything in the room and hotel was new modern and classy  The staff all spoke English and were incredibly helpful and nice  The location cant be beat  Within walking distance of all the major shoppingeating areas downtown but the hotel itself is not on a busy street which was nice  Highly recommend it and look forward to going back  
P => WOW  what a hotel An excellent property Stayed for  nights  adults and  children huge room high ceilings very clean and wonderful service what more can you ask  Located in downtown Montreal  steps to the US Consulate train station and Underground  Only drawback were the pillows too hard  Highly recommended  I will be sure to return to this hotel on my next visit to Montreal 
P => Great stay We just returned from a stay at Le Square Phillip Hotel  It was spotless very comfortable and the service was outstanding Our studio room was a regular sized hotel room but had a stove micro large refrig  and even a dishwasher  For all of this and being in the heart of downtown we paid a special holiday rate of under  USD per night One drawback of trraveling over the New Years weekend was that nearly all stores were closed on     On a side note a cab driver suggested dinner at Gibbys in Old Montreal and it was phenomenal Great food service and ambiance  Make reservations early and ask for an upstairs table  WOW 
P => The LeSquare Phillips is just great Stayed for  days late ober   Reasonable price  Appears to be new within the past year  Everything in the suite seems new  Good roomy bathroom great kitchen even with a dishwasher  Comfortable King size bed  Very bright and cheery in spite of the weather  Good Continental breakfast  Just half a block from the Bay and Sherbrooke Street  Good service by all departments in the hotel 
P => Simplement le meilleur Le Square Phillips has to be the best downtown hotel among all worldclass city hotels The reasonable price the prime location the rooms ambience and the courteous service are only some of the qualities that make this hotel the only place to come back to on future visits to Montreal  
P => Best place Booked this hotel for one week stay after reviewing so many good reviews and we werent disappointed  We stayed in a studio and its very big unit with good size kitchen  Since this hotel was reated  months back every thing looks new  Hotel is in a very good location and every thing is close by  Hotel staff are very courteous  You get free high speed internet connection  I forgot to take network cable and hotel provided me that freely  Complimentary Breakfast buffet is OK breads muffins bagels cereals oatmeal juices cofee and fruit salad but no Donuts or Danish I had a chance to see mini suit at the famous Elizabeth hotel and I can my room looked better than that  
P => OUTSTANDING We just got back from four days in Montreal  We stayed at this hotel because of the wonderful Trip Advisor reviews  I will definitely stay there again  The rooms were huge clean and well equiped  Nice clean bathrooms that were well supplied with towels and nice soaps and shampoo  We had a two bedroom suite  It was perfect  We fell inlove with Montreal it was our first visit  The conceirge and entire staff were more than helpful  One night the conceirge overheard me talking to my family about where to have dinner that night  A few minutes later he telephoned me to tell me he had printed a few recommendations up for us and brought them up to our room  The price was great and the location perfect  Out of all our travel and we travel a great deal Montreal and Le Square Phillips is our favorite

P => First Class All the Way When my boyfriend and I booked this hotel we did not realize that it had only opened in Spring   We stayed in a King Deluxe corner room which was absolutely stunning  Service was first class and the staff were very professional and polite  The hotel is also a mere   minute walk from St  Paul in Old Montreal  The breakfast buffet was also impressive with top quality food and service  We would definitely stay there again when we return to Montreal  
P => Great Value Stayed for a weekend with my wife hotel location is pretty amazing right near downtown core  After you get there pretty much anything is within walking distance  Got a great deal with flight from West jet  Hotel was still under construction so the pool was not open yet but the rooms are fairly large quiet and well orated  Bathroom is also very nice with higher end finishes  Overall great room for the value would def  stay again  
P => A couple of new hotel hiccups but great value and a beautiful room  Best rate in the city by  per night  A brand new hotel   everything was very clean  The room was beautiful great beds and bedding large well appointed excellent bathroom the buffet breakfast was great and the public spaces were lovely  The gym was the best in hotel gym Ive seen   the equipment was state of the art  On the downside staff communication didnt seem the best   the front desk gave us coupons for the bar because the Club was closed and the bar staff didnt seem to know what they were  The in room movies arent in place yet   annoying when travelling with kids  But all in all this would be our first choice next time we go to Montreal if the rate was right  Great location too   couple of blocks from the harbour in one direction couple of blocks from St  Catherines in the other  
P => Overvaluedvery poorly managed shouldnt be a Westin Stayed at Westin Montreal for two nights during labor day weekend  The hotel was somehow crowded and although I asked a high floor room and checked in at around pm they werent able to find a room higher then the rd floor  Obviously we got waken up early in the morning since there is a lot of traffic noise coming from St Antoine st  Staff at the reception was a total disapointment rude indolent and wouldnt speak to me in french do feel more comfortable speaking french  Also when we checked in our room I checked the sheets to make sure they were new as I always do and I found some red stains that looked like lipstick on it  We also got surprised when we asked for bathrobes and that the delivery man about  seconds after knocking on the door got into the room although the do not disturb sign was on the door this shows how well managed this hotel is    On the plus side they brought after two requests a nice dog bed for our pet  a night  Beds are also very comfortable  Very limited selection for room service  Wont return   
P => Brand New Clean and Good Location We stayed in the Westin for  nights in early ust  It was brnad new and very clean and fresh  The staff tried top b helpful but being that it just opened there were a few glitches   but we still enjoyed it The buffet breakfst was great and the location was good  It was right across from the convention center and a short walk to the old streets of Old Montreal 
P => Centrally located hotel with a Great Breakfast We had an excellent stay at this hotel  The room was clean amp spacious  Breakfast buffet was generous and delicious  The architecture of the pool being right above the main entrance was very cool   kids loved it Our only complaint was that because it was so new some things werent working the hot tub and the staff although very accommodating didnt have it fully together yet  I am sure that by now things are running very smoothly  
P => Good Luxury Hotel in Excellent Location Excellent modern hotel in the center of Montreal on the edge of the old town and a short walk to the city center shops Had a great room with a nice view up to Mont Royal  Clean modern spacious very comfortable beds well equipped bathroom cable TV AC etc  Seen gripes about the staff on here but they seemed fine to me I cant vouch for the price as I didnt pay and I didnt eat in the hotel  
P => Brand New    very comfortable Everything youd expect in a new Westin property  Perfect for business travel even though it is about a  min taxi ride from downtown or for a couples getaway  Service was personable  Rooms are brand new and fresh  The hotel is so comfortable and pleasant  Excellent room service for breakfast  Get the yogurt parfait and fruit platter   heavenly  Bathrooms are modern and clean  Go now before more people find out that it has opened 
P => Amazing beds lousy front desk personnels great location very clean reation done best beds in all of the hotels that weve stayed in   and weve stayed in many     not very helpful front desk people especially this one guy   we wanted to extend our stay one more nite at the same rate and i didnt like the condescending tone of speech   no smiles   I said i needed a cab to one woman and she just asked me to flag one on the street    i asked the same to the porter and bellboy outside and they were so helpful in calling a cab for me   and even recommended restaurants for me to go to when I asked    they were much much more friendlier than the so called quotfriendly staff at the deskquot     and the nice Korean lady who was the part time lifeguard there was very personable and also gave me ideas for food     oh internet is  cents a minute forgot to mention the cleaning lady was so nice that she even folded my dhters clothes left on the sofa 
P => Great Location   Nice Hotel My husband and I spent three nights at the new Westin Hotel in Montreal  There have been some bad reviews on this new hotel but Id like to say that we had a very nice experience  The room was very spacious and the bed and bathroom were truly quotheavenlyquot  We didnt have any lines for breakfast check in or for the valet  So Im assuming some of these issues have been worked out  Additionally the location is perfect  You can walk just about anywhere in the city  It is very centrally located  The only negative would be the pool  It is very small and cold  
P => Gives Westin Chain a Bad Name We got a really good price for the Westin and that is probably bc they have trouble attracting customers wall of their problems  They cant get basic things right like refilling the coffee service cups in the bedroom or say hot water we had none for  days  which they compensated for wa day of free parking at least  The staff seemed apologetic and nice but they cant do anything about the fact that the hotel is so strangely built if you get a cheap rate youll be in the short tower which is an escalator ride and about   mile away from everything the fact that its not busy enough to sustain a bar that stays open or that the hotel is in the middle of a sterile part of a city a part of the city that feels and looks surprisingly dead  One great thing the bed was heavenly at least and for the most part it was quiet  
P => Great new Hotel Despite reports of poor service at this recently opened hotel we ided to try it having been very satisfied with Westin Hotels elsewhere We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel  Service was excellent   no problems at all The rooms are on the large side and have the usual Heavenly Beds and Shower Location is perfect on the outskirts of the old city  There is a back entrance that enters directly into the old city  Buffet breakfast was included  Plenty to eat and high quality  Fruit was outstanding Located conveniently on the Metro for those who do not have a car or want to avoid Montreals horrific traffic congestion  
P => Beautiful hotel wonderful service great value ust      My husband recently had to go for a training in Montreal  The kids and I tagged along  ages   and  weeks old  I chose the Westin based on being new and I thought the kids would like the pool it has glass bottom panels that allow you to look below to the entry way of the hotel  We did the opening special which was  per night and included valet parking and breakfast for the  of us  I think I heard that the price of the buffet breakfast alone was around  per person so this deal was quite the savingsThe room  When we walked in to our room on the th floor we thought it was beautiful  An oversized hotel room with  heavenly beds very comfy a large desk  chairs and side table  Lots of room for the  of us to move about  The view out of the huge window was of the city  It was a gorgeous view The drapes on the window blocked out so much light that my kids slept in and had to be awakened at  every morning  You would have thought with how dark it stayed with the drapes pulled that it was night time   this was a very good thing no peeping sun in the morning The bathroom was large with a very large walk in shower  The vanity was granite and overall the lighting in the bathroom was very bright  The only bad thing is that they didnt have refrigerators yet  The bellman said that they would be getting them and there was a place for them in the dresser drawers cabinet  The place was very clean and housekeeping was more than accomodating  The service Not speaking any French had me concerned as I heard that this  be a problem for us  Not so everyone was very friendly to us and most in the city as well as the hotel spoke ent English  We had trouble getting our laptop to connect to the free high speed and the front desk was very helpful with connecting us to the people to get it working  Within  minutes we were able to access the internet  Also the concierege was very helpful in pointing out areas of interest and the best routes to get there The location  This hotel is within walking distance to the pier and about  or so blocks away from the Notre Dame Basilica  The metro was right across the street  This hotel is located in Old Montreal The pool  Although very small it was great for the kids  There were also  quothot tubsquot on the other side of the pool but because all of the water was soooo cold they were more like small pools  The kids would shower to get warm and then run and get into the pool  We never found out if there was a problem with the heater but construction was still going on in the building close to the pool area Construction  We did hear some construction noises but not until about  am and never in the evening  This was not a problem for us Parking  It is all valet parking I think it was  or so per day but we had it included in our package  It only took about  minutes for us to get our car when we needed it Quick service Restaurant  This was a  or  star restaurant and had a wonderful breakfast buffet with everything you could want  The omelets were the best Room service was very expensive but isnt it always Very good food though and only about  minutes wait  Dinner was very good and we received coupons for buy one entree get  off of the second along with kids eat free coupons when we checked in  We still spent  with tip included but it was very delicious food with excellent service as the restaurant was pretty empty at  pm Overall impression   Even though this was a very nice hotel there were lots of families there  You would have never known it though because the hallways were very quiet It seemed as though we were the only ones there but we saw our neighbors going into their rooms a few times  I am very picky in my taste for hotels I stay at and this one definitely met and exceeded my expectations  I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would stay there again if I ever go back to Montreal 
P => Its ready    best sleep ever until the am fire alarm Had a free night at this new property  Reading the reviews I was worried but figured the hotel construction would be over by now  It basically was  The room was spotless brand new etc  Great mattress  Got a quiet room facing another building  The location was great if you are at the Congress convention center  otherwise it would be a bit of a walk in the winter  Only one complaint  they did a fire alarm drill at am  I ran downstairs only to find out it was a test of the fire system at am  PS The hotel does not have a mini bar or other food for sale in the room  Also it is not owned by Westin  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
P => Beautiful new hotel across from convention center This hotel and or are really lovely and the rooms very large We were just getting our Montreal sea legs however and I would comment that while it is equi distant to both Old Montreal and St  Catherine it is really not super close to either   minute walk  It really is located super conveniently across from the convention center which was not of interest to us  With that said the hotel value was fantastic and the breakfast amazing The hotel was very busy with all types of travelers and they did a great job accommodating all of the needs  Best features large lovely clean rooms and wonderful breakfast in a hip urban environment  
P => Champagne Hotel for a Beer Budget Just got back from  days in Montreal  The Le Westin is still under a little construction I only saw a few things and none had any impact on our stay  I traveled with my wife and  yr dhter  We book a standard king room and I brought a inflatable mattress with us for the little one  However I was the one that ended up in it  The rooms where larger than average and brand new and very clean a nice double shower in the bathroom too  I have stayed in a lot of hotels that cost alot more and where no where near as nice  Great location just a block from Notre Dame Church We didnt eat at the hotel and followed recommendations for eggspectations just around the corner breakfast was really good Do not eat at Le Pyrennes the carriage ride guy that took us for a ride recommended this place and it was horrible The Bad The bar closed at  each night we where there the pool was a little cold for me too  
P => Worderful hotel   choice in Montreal Our family of four spent  nights in y and we loved this hotel  We were somewhat skeptical because of the previous reviews but were pleasantly surprised  From the service to the location this hotel is a great choice  The staff was extremely helpful and the rooms were spacious clean and nicely orated  We arrived after a  hour drive and were supposed to drop off the rental car at the airport  The young man who greeted us suggested we drop it off at a location near the hotel so we would save the  minute drive and the taxi fare when returning to the hotel  He called the company himself and made the arrangement  We met with him later in the lobby and he gave us wonderful restaurant suggestions  It turns out he was the food and beverages manager at the hotel  It goes to show how much effort they are putting into service when the food and beverages manager pitches in wherever he is needed  The location is hard to beat  We walked everywhere and after a long day our dhters enjoyed the glass bottom pool  Very unique indeed We highly recommend this hotel when visiting Montreal  
P => Not Ready For Prime Time In time say  to  months this facility  be ready for service  Until then I wouldsuggest you try another property  As a Starwood member we usually select a Westinwhere available because of the outstanding service provided  However this hotel isfar below the high standards of The Westin  There are so many problems with this hotel that it is difficult to know where to begin Rarely have I ever written a critical review of a Westin Hotel  The facility has great po tential but is not ready for prime time  I has opened far too early with inadequate training of staff completion of work in progress and poor design Several previous reviews have mentioned some of the difficulties they have encounterede g  poor concierge service lack of adequate staff inconsistent service long waits togain quotaccessquot to your car even after paying over  a night for parking  My wife and Ilove Montreal and Quebec appreciating the people and the culture but this hotel doesnot give a good first impression of such a wonderful city  We travel to Quebec for pleasure often and have never been disappointed  Management really needs to takenote in a very serious way the needs that are to be met  While I received an apology from the hotel for the poor service that is fine but it wont quotcut itquot if this is not addressed While the few staff we dealt with were very pleasant and did the best they could underthe circumstances smiles and kind gestures need to be met with service At this point I would not recommend this hotel to my friends  Perhaps in another  to months with a hit and miss here and there this facility  be ready for quotprime timequot  
P => Great location lovely service clean and rooms to perfection We just barely got back from Montreal and couldnt wait to write a review  Service  Amazing always polite and helpful  The concierge gave us maps to everywhere and just about anything  Valet parking was very helpfull Rooms  Lustrious beds comfortable pillows bi lingual stations on the plasma tv and extremely spacious Location  Le Westin is located smack center of all of the attention  All restaurants are within walking distance  very close to Subway for fast travel  This by far was one of the most elgant and relaxing hotel ive ever stayed in  
P => Le Westin Montreal is the best Just got back from spending two nights in Montreal at the newly opened Westin  It was fantastic We were greeted at the door by a very pleasant parking valet who whisked our car away while another valet carried our luggage into the hotel  The hotel lobby is breathtaking as is the or throughout including the restaurant bar and our room  Every staff member that we encountered spoke flawless english and made us feel very welcome  We will be going back 
P => Nice building good location not quite finished  Stayed there for three nights in early ust  Everyone there was very helpful and the hotel is located in a very convenient location in Montreal  It is a brand new hotel and is somewhat trendy and well designed Several problems came up over our stay  First there werent refrigerators in every room  We order one from the front desk but they were all taken  They put us on a waiting list but we never received a fridge Also the wireless internet was broken on our floor  We couldnt find any do not disturb signs and were constantly being bothered by the cleaning staff  While there is a pool in the building it is rather small  The heater for the pool was broken during our stay and the general pool area is not all that nice I wouldnt stay at this hotel again unless I was   certain all of these problems were fixed  
P => Fabulous location clean pleasant stay wouldnt stay anywhere else upon returning to Montreal My boyfriend and I were a bit hesitant to book this hotel after reading reviews of incompleteness elevator malfunction etc  But we ended up booking a standard room king size bed for our two nightthree day mini vacation to Montreal  It was one of the better experiences I have had while traveling  To begin the location is WONDERFUL  If you walk one way you are at Old MontrealNotre Dame Cathedral and if you walk the other way you are downtown right on Sainte Catherine street  It seemed to be only a max of  minutes from anything and everything  We have extremely high standards for dining and every restaurant we went to each within comfortable walking distance of the hotel was outstanding  The GPS brought us right to the entrance of the hotel on Sainte Antoine street and we had the car valeted  We had booked through hotels com and since I brought a copy of the confirmation email check in was easy  We received two keys for the th floor  Upon arriving in the room we were pleased with the simple elegant or complete with a flat screen TV and an iHome speakerclock radio  After two nights I can say that the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on  Everything was extremely clean and newWe had brought some juice and beverages to have in the hotel and were a bit surprised to find that there was no mini fridge  However we called concierge for some ice buckets and they were brought up promptly by an employee  This ended up making the drinks colder even quicker so it ended up working out nicely  For  a night this was super comfortable clean and a great location  It would be great for a businessman as well as it would be great for a family vacation  I would ONLY stay here if and when I return to Montreal HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
P => Terrific Stay Great Location We recently stayed for a week at this hotel while attending a conference at the Palais de Congres across the street The hotel was also in easy walking distance of the Notre Dame basilica and Old Montreal  Thanks to my husbands Starwood Gold status we were upgraded to the club lounge level  We had also signed up for a great pre paid deal where every other night was half price  Our room was fantastic comfy beds double headed stall shower good blackout shades  The workout facilities were open and provided various machines plus a pool  The only sign we had that the hotel was still not complete were workmen around during the day although we didnt hear them in the morning and the elevators malfunctioned a couple of times  However I would highly recommend this hotel the room was great and the staff were all helpful and friendly  
P => Great spot wonderful bed I arrived late for my meeting  Fortunately I was greeted in the lobby and my car was taken promptly for valet parking  I checked in went to my room changed and was back on the street in  minutes Everyone was polite courteous and efficient  I felt like I was staying with friends  The rooms are new the bed is comfortable and the food at the hotel restaurant was excellent  It was hot in Montreal  but the room was nice and cool  Excellent location both to reach by car and to visit the old city  I will definitely stay there again  It is an excellent Westin hotel  Wife agrees  
P => Nice stay still not ready I was excited to stay at this new Westin property in Old Montreal  There still seems to be a bit of work left to do to make it an inviting hotel experience  The style is very nice I liked the grand entrance and the glass bottom pool  The room was fairly spacious and well appointed very nice bathroom with glass door shower and very comfortable Queen size beds  You can tell the hotel is not ready yet because lack of signage I had no idea how to get to my room The hotel is very big and feels like a maze There are two quottowersquot in this hotel    I was in the rear tower  To get to my room I needed to climb the escalator to the restaurantlounge level then find the elevator    of which there were several  The first bank of elevators I tried nearest to the escalators brought me up to an open and unfinished space which was definitely not my floor  It looked like unfinished convention or office space which was strangely unrestricted to curious or lost guests  When I returned to the lounge level a security guard approached me and instructed me to go down another hall to find the correct elevator  On my floor I also noticed a number of rooms with sheets of paper taped to the door with room numbers on them and boxes of materials light bulbs signs etc just sitting around  Trying to find the poolfitness room involved going down the elevator to the lounge level walking through the lounge area and going up another set of elevators in the other tower  Again no signage so I had to guess where these other elevators were and what floor the pool was on  Some travel tips    the Metro is just across the street at the Palais des Congres  You can also park there for half of what the hotel charges for parking  There is an Eggspectation restaurant around the back of the hotel where you can get a good breakfast or lunch for a fraction of what the hotels restaurant charges  Aside from the problems experienced    which I can overlook now that Ive explored and figured out where everything is    the staff were very polite and helpful for any questions I had or issues I couldnt resolve on my own  Id like to see what this place will look like in another   months from now after these issues have hopefully been corrected  
P => Westin was okay but still has a few problems  As previously posted there is still no fridge in the room the hardware on the dresser fell off and the elevators in the main tower are slow  The main problem with the elevators was in the morning and the evenings around dinner time during the weekends  There are only  elevators to service the main wing and even thou the floors arent that big the elevators are always busy  During the week days we didnt have this problem with the elevators  The snack shop in the lobby had very little of offer and you had to go to the front desk to pay for your items  This was a real turnoff especially when there was a long line of guests waiting to register  Also there are no ice machine on the floor so I called the operator to have someone bring up some ice  After about  minutes I had to call again about the ice  Another  minutes went by and finally the ice arrived The pool and fitness center were open but there is still work needed in the immediate area i e  the bathrooms  Overall the room was nice and clean  We didnt have to wait that long at check in and the location is great close to Old Montreal but the hotel still has some issues that it needs to work on  
P => Great location great staff but overall let down Great location amp great staff   friendly and helpful  But there are things that spoil the overall experience in this hotel which is out of the control of the staff Whoever designed this hotel should not be designing another one  First of all the drive in drop off area is too small   put  big cars and a taix in there and you have urself a traffic jam  It is much better to park temporarily on the street to unload   kinda defeat the purpose of staying at this luxury hotel  During check in checkout times despite the valetbell boys working flat out it still takes  min to get my car out of the carpark  Cmon Westin we are paying  for the valet   at least provide some service  This is not a matter of valetbell boys being lazy they arent but a matter of having a better system  Same goes to the checkin checkout counter   you should expect a longggggg queue during quotpeakquot hours  Express checkout solves part of the problem nd bad design if your room is in another tower at the back you have to haul your luggage from the lobby up the lift or escalator one floor up then haul it  metre to another lift then haul it up to your floor rd bad design the king bed room is tiny with hardly any room to move  Trying to squeeze so much furniture in is stupid  Switching on all   lights in the room still does not provide adequate lighting   but I guess some people like the room dim  The light surrounding the ensuite bathroom mirror is nice but stupid   it is too glarey to the eyes Everything used in the room is genuinely good stuff though from linen to toileteries to the heavenly bed  The room is also very well made up each morning  But if youre paying that much youd expect that much So overall its a good hotel but I wont go there again just because there are too many little things that add up to spoil the overall experience  For similar price you have heaps of options around town  But if the helpful and smiley staff makes your day then go ahead and stay there  
P => Still not ready for primetime    Dont believe the reviews saying that this hotel has worked out its kinks anyone there this past Sunday when the elevators were all broken again and the valet area was a complete disaster would disagree The rooms themselves are large and nice and ready for guests at least for the most part but the property as a whole still seems like it hasnt undergone a final check through with Starwood in preparation for actually opening  As a result as with any franchise it kind of tarnishes the brand as a whole The underlying problem we witnessed over four days was a managementmanpower one this property needs desperately a competent general manager and then it needs to hire many more workers especially on weekends  The staff we encountered were helpful and great but there just werent enough of them  This caused a horrible tie up in the valet area with guests waiting an hour for their cars and an employee passing out from being overworked  This also caused long check in lines and in actuality no real dedicated concierge as they were expected to check people in too  As for the elevators the property should act like the airlines and give some sort of credit to anyone staying there when they are broken  It really isnt fun carrying kids up dozens of flights of stairs  This isnt all the propertys fault   Im sure its Thyssen Krupp   who installed defective elevators   including designing a system that could take down all of the three elevators at once  But as consumers we dont think about the bad service work of Thyssen Krupp but instead blame the hotel Its just not the only little design flaw of the hotel   Aside from the parking debacle and lack of sufficient space I dont understand how someone could have designed a swimming pool that small for a property that large  The heat still doesnt work so it now appears that there are three small pools but at some point in the future they will eventually fix the heating problems and then the sole remaining pool will be tiny even if the glass bottom is very cool Whether its space in the cabinet of your room empty begging for a small refrigerator or an exercise room lacking earphones this hotel still doesnt live up for the westin name  Which is ashame because the hardworking staff few of them that there are are nice and make a great effort and should be recognized  Time for a management change to actually get this property to the level it should be  Hard to believe someone spent thirty plus million dollars to leave it at this state of functioning  Im surprised at Starwood for allowing the property to open and operate at this level   its a nice property  
P => Great Location Huge Rooms Wonderful Stay We stayed at the Westin    through  and were pleasantly surprised  especially after reading the less than stellar reviews  PositiveOur room was huge  two queen beds  not doubles  with a seating area desk etc  and plenty of room to spare  Excellent location  the metro is right across the street and Old Montreal is a two minute walk away  We walked to restaurants every night and found the area to offer lots of options Cleanliness  our room was spotless as were the common areas we saw  The bartender was very friendly and welcoming  and made good wine recommendations too Room service was really fast  a plus after a late  p m  arrival NegativesThey are grossly under staffed  They need at least four or five people on the front desk during peak periods  The most we saw was three  Fortunately for us we didnt arrive or depart at peak but I felt for those who were standing in line The restaurant is crazy expensive  Breakfast for two bagel with smoked salmon and a yogurtgranola parfeit with coffee for two  with tip  Food was good though They need a real gift shop with a real clerk  You have to pay for gift shop items at the front desk and if theres a line   well you get the picture They were having elevator issues Sunday morning as I was leaving but a quick call to the front desk and they sent someone up with the frieght elevator so I could check out  I would definitely stay here again when visiting Montreal  
P => Uninspired Corporate Hotel with a Good Location and Restaurant Spent four nights at the newly opened Westin on a upper floor  The room had great view of the city skyline with Mont Royal in the background  Originally I had thought is was a good deal at  approx  with tax a night off their website  But as usual you get what you pay for The previous reviewers were correct Prosa Professional courteous check inb Room was very clean and had a very comfortable king sized bed  You can buy it for  if you wish at the Westin website c Location   Top of old Montreal across the street from the  Palais des congr s  convention centre and right next to the Metro  Tip  At the Congress centre you can find a mini mall with cafes shops Tim Hortons and a shop selling beer wine cigs etc  that is open until  pm  The entrances to the Congress mall are not ked well and look like entrances to an office building d Exercise Room   The pool is great for kids small amp supervised with a glass bottom  The exercise room is very clean and has a variety of both cardio and weight machines beware Ladies   the lowest free weight is   lbs  d Gazette the hotel restaurant was ultra modern had an extensive wine list and was of high quality   Recommended e Room internet wired not WIFI worked well Consa For a new hotel the or is bland uninspired and corporate  The entrance is cave like and always involved navigating SUVs and baggage carts  Layout is awkward and the elevators are  metres from the lobby although they were high speed with rarely a wait b The room did not have a minibar or fridge however the smallest ice bucket I have ever seen was available to find a hidden ice machine behind an unked door  Signage please c The windows are sealed forcing you to enjoy recycled hotel air d My room didnt have a bathtub but the shower was large and modern e I always like to read about the a city s attractions before I venture out to explore the city  In the room there were no city guides and the room information was weak  I then checked out the lobby where quotfive starquot hotels always have obvious large collections of brochures and info  None there  Back in the room I turn on the cheap LCD TV to check out guest services and the local hotel channel  The hotel doesn t even have an interactive TV system  Checking out involved using a paper folder in a drop box  Is this a new hotel in  I am visiting I wonder f A one litre bottle of room water was   Don t insult your guests this way  
P => We will be back at the Westin The service was great  The staff were friendly  The room was very nice and my husband and I loved the bed  We ate dinner at the hotel and I had the best ceasar salad I have ever had in my entire life  The gym and pool area was very nice  Their is a Tim Hortons across the street in the convention center which you always have access to  We will be back and stay at this hotel  My only issue would be the cost to park  I feel for what you pay for the rooms parking should be included  
P => Beautiful Hotel Construction is Basically Finished My family recently stayed at Le Westin Montreal for  nights while touring the city and this hotel is beautiful and fresh  At this point the vast majority of construction in the hotel is finished  You no longer need to worry about the hotel being understaffed elevators not working dusty rooms etc  We didnt encounter any problems  The only things that still need to be finished are the sidewalk pavement on the corner by the hotel and a little bit of construction in a small area near the fitness center  However these are extremely minor things that wont impact your stay When we arrived to check in we were greeted by an extremely professional and upbeat staff  Since the hotel is so new everyone who works there still seems to be energetic and excited ready to help you with whatever you need  The valet staff was helpful but not pushy greeting us every time we walked into or out of the hotel and always bringing the car up very quickly  We were impressed by the staffs ability to recognize us and always greet us in English once they realized that we dont speak French  It was a nice little detail that you dont necessarily find at large city hotels  The front desk staff was also very professional willing to answer any of our questions and addressing concerns with the utmost in professionalism  The drive up entrance area to the hotel is nice in that it is completely covered and removed from the street  It was nice to be able to walk into the covered area and get the car brought up without feeling like we were in the middle of a busy city street  This will definitely be nice in the winter  Because the hotel was made from a combination of old and new buildings and wings it is set up a little bit oddly but we never found this to be a problem  The lobby is rather large with seating areas on one side and a large check in area on the other  There were escalators up to the second floor which offered more seating areas and the loungebar We were given a room with  queen beds in the new main tower where most rooms are located I believe it was called the St  Antoine tower  The elevators were down a hallway past the restaurant and front desk  It was kind of nice that we had to walk past the front desk every time we went to the room since the staff always said hello and recognized us by the second day  Each of the guest room floors is relatively small set up in a square shape with rooms on all  sides  I imagine that some of the views are less than stellar but we were given a room on a high floor facing out toward Rue St  Antoine so we had a ent view of the Palais de Congres the small parksquare by the hotel and some downtown office and apartment buildings  The room itself was gorgeous and brand new  Everything still had a new smell to it in a good way  The room had  queen beds with the usual Westin white down ensemble  There was a small sitting area with  chairs a large desk and a nice large flat screen tv  The bathroom was one of our favorite parts as it was spacious with a huge walk in shower  This is a feature we loved  For a city hotel the room was actually very large and the window was large to let in a lot of light during the day  Everything was orated in gray white and light blue so we found the room to be a true calming retreat after each long day of touring Montreal  We were on the executive club level so we had access to the club lounge  Since our stay was partially over a weekend we didnt get full use of it  We arrived on Saturday night and we were surprised that it wasnt open for breakfast until Tuesday with hors doeuvres being offered starting on Monday night  The club lounge staff was all very pleasant and professional and the lounge itself had a lot of nice seating  It could be a bit small if the hotel was full but we didnt experience any problems  We enjoyed the breakfast with the usual cold items  We didnt eat in the hotel restaurant but we did take a peek at the menu for breakfast and prices were the usual for hotels with the buffet breakfast around  per person and individual entrees around   We didnt check the menu for dinner The indoor swimming pool is very interesting and fun since it has a glass bottom in the center that looks down to the hotel entranceway below  It was always fun to walk into the hotel and watch people swimming above and our family enjoyed going in the pool  There were also two smaller pools next to the large glass bottom pool which looked like jacuzzis but turned out not to be  I dont exactly know what they were since they were the same depth as the main pool but werent any warmer and didnt have whirlpool jets  The pool closes early at  pm so be aware of this before planning a later swim The hotels location is perfect for touring Montreal  There are  metro stops within easy walking distance Square Victoria and Place dArmes  The hotel staff directed us to walk to the  blocks to Square Victoria but we found it easier to use Place dArmes which can be accessed very easily by walking through the nice and new Palais de Congres that is directly across the street  Vieux Montreal and the Notre Dame Basilica are only a block or two away as well  We also walked from the hotel up to McGill University and Parc Mont Royal which were a bit of an uphill hike but still doable  The area around the hotel was a bit dead on the weekend since its a business area but it was very safe and centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go  There are many restaurants close to the hotel  You  not see much upon first inspection but walking around the surrounding  or  blocks in any direction will reveal a good number of cafes and restaurants All in all we loved our stay at this brand new hotel  Everything about it was new and clean with the great service and atmosphere weve come to expect at Westin properties  We didnt experience any problems with construction so Id say its now safe to start staying here Most of the kinks seem to be worked out  Well be back if were even in Montreal again  
P => Birthing Pains at the newest Westin This Westin is the newest in the group and opened in e  The handsome re use of an old Montreal newspaper building is quite impressive The hotels entrance is literally carved into the building and features a one of kind swimming pool atop the entrance where swimmers wave at the visiting guest through the pools glass bottomThe rooms have been cleverly incorporated into the building design  The corner rooms are suite like in size with wall  to wall windows The hotel si still in a shakeout period  On Sunday the elevators had a mind of their own  We rode a full elevator up and down three times as it round tripped between the rd and th floors without stopping The hotels restaurant was inundated with breakfast guests taking advantage of the buffet  There was a long line of guests waiting for a table and the servers were overwhelmed by the crowds  As most of the diners used buffet coupons I cant see a change in the crowds The hotel is only half open and they are finishing construction of a second wing  Hopefully they will be able to accomodate more guests at the restaurant in the future  The location is very convenient to Old Montreal Notre Dame and the Congrees Center  The building is connected to the passageways behind the buiding for those seeking cover during inclement weather and the Congress Center connects the undergorund passage ways and subway  
P => great location great rooms My wife and I stayed at Le Westin in early y for  nights while we visited sites in and around Montreal  I got a deal on the Westin through Travelzoos which gave us   off the listed rate so that was quite nice The hotel was only opened for  weeks when we stayed so they were still working on some parts and the pool was not yet opened  It all still smelled new The valet parking was a real treat and not something this traveler is used to  This service was included in the night parking fee which is reasonable considering you are downtown and you would be hard pressed to find better price to park Rooms were very nice and spacious  Beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows and bathroom was spacious and well appointed  We did not have a tub only shower which was okay with us Location of this hotel is what really sold me   blocks from Notre Dame church and within walking distance of all other old downtown activities  Nice for seeing the sites and going for drinks and dinners  
P => Great Stay We stayed at the Westin for one night on y th  We thought the hotel was very nice it felt very luxurious  The pool and gym were both open and being used  The valet service went smoothly  When we checked in the person at the front desk told us they would give us a nice room with a view and they did We had a beautiful view of the city  Im not sure what other people are complaining about but we thought the room was very nice and the bed is sooooooo comfortable  My only complaint was that they forgot to put bar soap in our bathroom but no biggie  Just ask and theyll send some to your room  
P => Great location and good price The staff were really nice and helpful the rooms were clean and spacious beds really comfortable  Bathrooms were nice and it was really quiet  The pool would have been nice but it wasnt complete and some of the elevators were not in operation yet  Some things in the room caused a bit of inconvenience no fridge no ice on the floor yet some minor details in the bathroom were incomplete ridiculously expensive bottled water in the rooms  The parking is pretty expensive too but the staff pointed us to cheaper parking across the street  Our room had a great view but our friends room looked out onto a brick wall  Basically this hotel is complete enough to be open for operation   but just barely However overall it was good  We got a really really good price for the night and it was in a great location it was very comfortable and the staff were nice  
P => Not Westin Quality My husband planned a spontaneous getaway to Montreal to celebrate our wedding anniversary  We were concerned about the Westin after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor especially as we have previously stayed at the W in Montreal and had a great time  We called the Westin and they assured us that they had improved including the pool being opened Needless to say we arrived at the hotel today  We waited  minutes to check in at the desk for GoldPlatinum members to be told when we were next that the concierge would help us when they could and the attendant simply left us standing there dumbfounded  We were finally checked in and quotupgradedquot to a deluxe king room on the th floor with a city view  City view looking into neighboring office windows including in the bathroom  Deluxe space for  large pillars in the room that make it awkward to navigate the room  My husband grew tired of waiting for the bellman and grabbed our luggage and brought it to the room himself  Nobody even questioned why we were taking luggage from behind the bellmans stand  We found trash from the prior occupants of the room on the desk they were Gold passport members and paid  per night  To our utmost dis housekeeping came after we had checked in and asked us if she had cleaned the room yet  I assume the answer is not completely as we found the prior occupants trash  The final kickers the pool is not open it smells of paintdust there is construction still going on the mini bar is an empty space in the room and it takes   minutes for the elevator to arrive The good part is that they have free Internet and I can post how horrible this experience has been thus far  If it changes I will update this posting but I am not hopeful  It also has a Heavenly bed It  be a great hotel in the future but I would not risk it  The W is a few blocks away and we had a great experience there previously  Their quotdealsquot are not worth a dusty dirty but supposedly new room with a view of office buildings 
P => Unnecessarily Generic with Lots of Hiccups A friend and I have been to Montreal a number of times and had previously stayed at the W great but a little too clubby with rooms built for couples and the St  Paul aims high but pretentious and feels a little beat up  When we saw the brand new Westin was open we figured it would be the perfect place as Westins are usually cool and the hotel was in a great location  Anyway we arrived in Montreal and pulled up to a very ugly driveway and were greeted with a very visible front and center overflowing trash can by the valet station  That was a terrible first impression  The lobby was stark barren and plain and they were three hours late getting us our room    sitting around a lobby is no way to start a vacation  The rooms and hallways were corporate and plain really surprising for a new hotel  And the towels were so brand new that there were fuzzies over all our clothes and in our hair every day  Ultimately if you need a clean place to stay with very comfortable beds the Westin is great  If you want a hotel youll remember forget it  It feels like no thought or style was put into this hotel  Just blah and generic like out of a movie that satirizes corporate generic hotels  Again this is really surprising for a brand new hotel from Westin  Youd expect theyd put more thought and effort into this property  Oh well  
P => Le Westin Montreal should build up to better  I stayed at Le Westin Montreal   y for the Montreal Jazz Fest  My boyfriend is a Starwood employee and got us a special rate which I wont disclose but it was far less than the  night they were asking that weekend which in my opinion is not worth it for this hotel  For starters the hotel is still under construction which the website doesnt tell you although they advertise amenities that are not yet available  The touted lap pool is not completed although you can use the pools of the nearby sister properties nor is the spa although there is info in the room about it  Only one of the three elevators are operational at any given time and painfully slow  There are several incomplete areas of the hotel covered in sheets or tarps and that quotnew carpet smellquot filled the air  We were the first guests to occupy our room which still had a little construction dust in the bathtub and some dust on the furniture  The room contained a flat panel TV a clock radio that supports the iPodiPhone cordless phone several lamps and a Heavenly Bed  The room is spacious with a full size sofa bed and a large desk but no stationery or note pads for writing  The AC worked well and we had good wifi reception  There is a very  green  theme to the hotel evidenced by the soap toiletries recycling bins etc The bathroom was not as spacious as the rest of the room but it wasnt a tight fit  The bathtub has dual shower heads and curved shower curtain  The bathroom fan is very quiet and the towels are wonderfully soft and thick  The vanity however has false drawers so you dont have any storage in the bathroom  Overall the room was OK but on the basic side for what is supposed to be a  Star hotel    we were not impressed and very glad we were not paying the rack rate  We visited two barsrestaurants in the hotel  Gazette on the first floor and the Reporter Lounge on the rd floor  Of course the prices were typical for a hotel  Tuesday Saturday a reception is offered at the Reporter bar from    However you must get there early as the free sampling of food and beverages go quickly  Valet parking is CADday inout but here is a parking lot across the street that offers parking for a few dollars less  The hotel is in a very convenient location to the Old Port and adjacent to a Metro station  Given that Montreal is very walkable you dont need to take your car out unless youre leaving the city  I found most of the hotel staff to be warm and friendly with the exception of the day time front desk staff  The bar restaurant and room service staff were quite congenial  The bell staff valet and housekeeping were good but there was no turndown service  Everyone was always smiling and eager to help although the front desk day staff could seem a bit more motivated  All I can guess is that their lack of enthusiasm stems from dealing with the complaints and comments from disappointed clients who expected the hotel to have the quality of a  star Starwood Group property and the advertised features available  As one reviewer mentioned it seems as if Starwood wanted to get this place open by peak tourist season even though there are still building permits on the windows  They should indeed be ashamed for delivering a product in this condition  I dont think that well stay here again even with the employee discount  There are several properties in the Starwood Group and other hotel chains in the immediate vicinity that would give you better quality for the same price or less than what youd pay at Le Westin  
P => Amazing Hotel     in about  months from now  I stayed at quotLe Westinquot for  nights this summer  In the future I see this hotel as being a great place to stay however the hotel is brand new and during our stay there were a few significant problems  There were also some nice surprises though Checking in the staff was extremely friendly and inviting  Then the first  problems happend all in a row  we were informed that the glass bottomed swiming pool was still under construction  the package we booked was supposed to include a welcoming bag with a free gift breakfast tickets for the restaurant and various other little goodies  This was forgotten and i had to request it later on in the evening  i tried to smoothly slide the valet his tip as I was handing him my keys and instead droped the money on the ground  Not the hotels fault obviously but still felt it was worth mentioning here for comedic effect The room itselft was beautiful  It probably had the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept in in my life  I could have stayed in it for the entire trip if it wasnt for the construction noises well get to that later  The bathroom was also gorgeous  Only problem was the quotdual nozzle rainforest showerheadquot advertized on the website isnt really as neat as it sounds  I was expecting to be enveloped in water sprayed from all sides or at least  sides with absolutely no escape from the wetness  Unfortunately this was not the case  Its just a normal shower head with two different settings on it  At least the bathroom was beautiful My wake up call the next morning was not beautiful   mostly because I didnt order one  It came in the form of construction noises at am  One story above us directly outside our window I know this for a fact because you could see the scafolding from our window  You could say it doubled as a sunshade for our room Its one thing to rent out a hotel while its still under construction but care should at least be taken to avoid renting out rooms that are within a close proximity to the noise  I would have complained had I not already grumbled the night before about the false advertising on the swiming pool being open And now for some positives  delicious buffet breakfast located far away from construction noises   extra bathrobe and toothpastes knew i forgot to pack something given upon request When the check out receipt arrived under our door the total price was incorrect  It did not reflect the special package which I had booked through their website  The staff did however quickly fix the problem at the front the desk  They also appologized again for the lack of swimming pool when i mentioned it and where able to ammend the situation so that I didnt leave the hotel with a negative image of the experience Then ofcourse the valet took  minutes to retrieve my car  Just like the rest of the staff though they were extremely polite which makes it difficult to be annoyed with the situation  A possible reason for the problem could have been insufficient number of valet attendents scheduled to work andor lack of space in the driveway to park all the cars it was full   when I did finally get my car the attendant had to bring it onto the street Overall I would say that this hotel will be a wonderful place to stay but only after its completely finished and all the kinks have been worked out of the system  In my opinion I believe the main thing saving this hotel from bad executive isions is a team of very dedicated and professional staff members  At the moment Im unided as to whether or not Ill ever return but I would recommend it for the traveller desiring fine hospitality in a great location    just give it another  months before you book  
P => Two star service with a four star location I brought a group of my customers to this hotel and we had a few issues  We brought  people and used some convention space the hotel had room issues construction problems and a very unconcerned staff  
P => Le Westin  a nice addition to Montreal I stayed one night at the new Le Westin  It had only been open for a few weeks so it wasnt very busy  The hotel is located on the edge of Old Montreal in a very walkable area  Parts of the hotel are still being finished such as the pool and spa  I was met with very friendly staff members at all times during my stay  My corner room was on the th floor and was of course spotless  The carpet still has that new carpet smellI look forward to returning when all of the construction is done  
P => Nice Hotel   But still Under construction My wife and three children were in Montreal for two nights in e and opted to stay here  It is orated very nicely and is in an excellent location near historic Montreal with only a very short walk to the Notre Dame Basilica  We booked a quotgrand openingquot rate which included valet parking CADday and  days of a buffet breakfast which would have been about CADday for the  of us All the staff we encountered from the front desk valet attendants maids to the waitresses in the restaurant were extremely friendly and professional  We requested extra towels and a rollaway bed the towels were brought in  minutes and the rollaway arrived within mins and they set up the bed with the sheets blankets etc The website was a bit misleading with regards to the pool it was not open yet much to the disappointment of my kids however they do offer to pay your taxi fare to the Sheraton to use their pool which we opted not to do and in addition to the glass bottomed pool over the lobby area the spa area is supposed to have a pool which was not ready either  We had checked in around pm in the evening and didnt notice any construction activity until we were awakened at am by drilling and hammering and pipe work on the floor above us and other noises which seemed to come from other areas of the hotel we were on the th floor  I think if you were on the th to the th floors you would have definitely been disturbed by the noise After mentioning this to the front desk they apologized profusely and moved us to the st floor and gave us access to the Westin Executive Club on the nd floor top floor  We slept soundly the next morning with no construction noise  For the Buffet Breakfast a chef was on hand to make omelets or fried eggs to your preference and orange apple and other juices were provided along with numerous fresh fruit choices blackberries raspberries blueberries pineapple cantaloupe and strawberries  Assorted danishes muffins bagels and toast  Cold cereals oatmeal scrambled eggs bacon ham and more  Overall an excellent buffet  The only issue was a portion of the restaurant was under construction and they were cutting and gluing wallpaper just on the other side of the wall from us  Im sure if this hotel was in the US I dont think they would have been given an occupancy permit or allowed to work when customers were eating  The third floor has two sets of escalators leading to a nice big seating area which overlooks the lobby and some conference room spaces at one end of the floor and a business area with multiple computers with internet access  This floor had areas draped off for construction and parts of the carpet in the public space still needed to be tacked down  At times the revolving front door of the Hotel didnt work and it seemed they were continually trying to repair it  At one point one of the side doors and the revolving door was out of commission which left one door for everyone to go in and out of  Apparently the Hotel had only been open for a month but I dont think it was quite ready for the general public just yet and apparently they have another portion of the block under construction we were told to add another wing to the Hotel  But the two rooms we stayed in were very clean nicely orated and the heavenly beds were extremely comfortable along with free Wi Fi internet which worked just fine  Id stay there again but Id be sure to make sure the pools were open and that the construction was completed  
P => El Hotel Westin En Montreal  
P => Hotel molto buono personale necessita di un p  di rodaggio  
P => 
P => Large Rooms City Center Nice hotel  Great Location  Very child friendly  Carpet in the room could use replacing and room service could use a little work  
P => Week end getaway made perfect Big bright beautiful room with a bed so large I joked with my wife that I needed a shuttle bus to get around it Most comfortable bed I have ever encountered  Bathroom was of spotless ble  Front desk staff concierge and door men were lovely genuine people who went out of their way for us  Hotel bar and restuarant are small upscale brass mahogony and candle lit  Hotel is around the corner from St  Catherine St  and with the new Bixi Bikes all over the downtown a short bike ride from all of the downtown  Lots of restaurants and bars nearby  Do not be concerned about the reports of noise  Friday and Sat  night there was activity on the street but nothing to bother us trying to sleep  I would be more worried if the hotel was right on St  Catherine but it is not  
P => Great hotel in Montreal The Loews is next to great shopping but a bit far from Old Montreal town  Youd have to cab it there  The rooms were quite nice   very comfortable beds flat screen TV big tub robes umbrella in the closet stereo to plug in your iphoneipod  The front desk was also very helpful in helping us find a restaurant  The parking at the hotel is day you can go inout  However if youre planning to go inout there is an outside parking lot right next to the hotel for  for  hours  
P => Always meets or surpasses expectations    Weve been going to the Loews Vogue at least once a year for the past several years  One of their better traits is the consistent superb experience in dealing with their staff at all levels  They are always bright helpful and sincere  We cannot recollect a situation that was handled in the best possible way by this boutique hotel  Not only are they centrally located in Montreal to all the best shopping and most of the high dining establishments but they are regarded as a pet friendly place  They treat customers pets as though they are customers in their own right  Loews Vogue keeps us coming back time and again to Montreal as they keep their charm  
P => The perfect getaway hotel in downtown Montr al We stayed at the Vogue for  nights and were very satisfied with the hotel  Upon arrival just around lunch time the rooms were already prepared for check in  We booked a sweet deal package in a Luxury King room which included continental breakfast by room service  Without any fuzz you could upgrade the breakfast to include eggs and ham etc for a few dollars  As the hotel did not have any breakfast buffet only ala carte in the Cellini restaurant the room service option was very convenient  Everyone in the staff were very helpful and accomodating everytime  Rooms were large and comfortable and the bathroom featured a flat screen tv bubble bath and a arate shower cabin  Our in room coffee maker with complimentary coffee was used several times a day  The only downsides were that you could not adjust the temperature in the room just turn the ac on or off  It did not bother us much though so we never called and asked if that was something they could do anything about  Traffic can be bothersome somtimes so if you are easily disturbed by noise from the street bring earplugs or ask for a courtyard room if they have any  Just a hint do NOT go to the Cellini restaurant for drinks  The hotel bar Opera was full so we went to the restaurant instead  Nice and friendly service and all but the bartender had absolutely no clue of how to mix drinks  A better advice is to order drinks from Opera and bring them to the lounge area by the reception  
P => Clean Quiet Great Service My wife and I stayed here during the first two days of a trip around Quebec  Service from the moment we pulled up was prompt efficient and professional  All requests were handled professionally and with a smile  Bed was extremely comfortable and the views of the city from our room were great and suprisingly quiet  Room service was fast and the food was great  One of the better smoked meat sandwhiches I had on the whole trip  We will certainly stay here again when in the area  
P => Service with a smile From the outset the front desk the doorman and the concierg always referred to as Mr and Mrs  so and so  As the hotel is somewhat small this intimacy made the experience very special The rooms were ent size beds were dreamy and the bathrooms were oversized   We had a corner room with  large windows We used the valet services for our car  They were quite prompt in bringing our car to the front of the hotel  We used taxis at night and they were easily summoned by the doorman The small lobby had free wifi This downtown location is close to most of the business and tourist venues 
P => Very nice location   comfy bed I just visited Montreal with my mom and we stayed at Loews Vogue for  nights  Great location   right by Rue Sainte Catherine in downtown great location if you love to shop  Also there are lots of great restaurants and nightlife near by  Walking distance to a metro station comfy beds large bathroom also if you are jogger you will be close enough to jog to Old Montreal or Mont Royal in the morning  I highly recommend it  
P => Loews is now one of my favourite hotel brands I had a wonderful one night stay in uary en route to Quebec City  After having stayed at the Hotel Vogue in Montreal and at the Loews in Miami Beach I can safely say that Loews is now one of my favourite hotel brands   the level of service and accommodation is top notchWe found an amazing deal on the hotel website     for a King room including continental room service breakfast for two and valet parking I did the math and valet amp breakfast on their own would have been over   My boyfriend ided not to have the continental breakfast and simply paid the difference between it and another breakfast option Pros While quite small there is a clean and comfortable lobby with a fireplace sitting area and two free internet stations near the concierge desk  Friendly staff throughout the hotel from guest services to room service to the valet attendants  Huge room Loads of space for storage tons of room for walking there was even a arate makeup area with a mirrored counter and stool outside the bathroom  Huge bathroom Included a arate shower and a jacuzzi tub with a small flat screen TV overall quite nicely appointed lots of ble though it felt a bit early s  Great location Right next to St Catherine across the street from Ogilvy and down the block from Holt RenfrewCons  The only minor complaint is that they forgot turndown service even though it was requested at check in we mentioned the error when checking out and they were very apologetic I also mentioned this in the online customer satisfaction survey that was emailed to me after our stay and I got a personal email of apology from the hotel nice touchI absolutely would not hestitate to stay here again the next time I am in Montreal and am just a bit sad that I didnt get to spend more time in our spacious room 
P => Great hotel just a little less in the service department than I would expect from a  Star  Dont get me wrong   this is a phenomenal hotel   the bathrooms alone are the size of some hotel rooms We had a jacuzzi bathtub which was great to soak in after a few days of walking everywhere  The robes provided were heavenly and the bedding was incredibly soft Beware though   parking is day but there are in and out privileges  The work out facility is nice but there is no pool  Also as another member reked you must request turn down service  I am used to it being provided  Also there is shoe shine if you leave shoes outside door  Staff was relatively helpful but I feel we had to wait in line for concierge every time we wanted to talk with her  
P => Great Stay at the Vogue Great rooms big ble bathroom ipod docking and all the other amenties that you would expect But it was the staff that really made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived  Thanks to everyone for a fun weekend in Montreal  
P => Superb Hotel Stay This hotel looked exactly like the photos  It was lovely with many little appointments that made it special  two robes two hairdryer stations one in the large bathroom in front of the magnifiedlit make up mirror and one at a sweet little make up area outside the bathroom with a seat and make up lamps  Tip bring bath salts  they have excellent large jacuzzi tubs with a small flat screen tv in the bathroom that begs for long luxurious bathing  I worried about loud parties on the street because of reviews Id read but it was absolutely silent in our perfect room    a corner room in the back  king size bed  huge bathroom  The concierge services were great  They recommended restaurants walking routes and gave maps with easy directions for specific areas we wanted to visit  The restaurant in the hotel  Cellini  was also quite good and very convenient with a good selection of Italian red wines at very affordable prices   We didnt get the turn down service until we requested it  Be sure you do as they provide two bottles of water per night REally a lovely gracious hotel  Only improvement to be made is the carpet in our room was tired and stained  rest of the room was perfect  
P => this hotel is just ok I dont get what all the hype surrounding the reviews of this hotel is all about  It is just ok  It is a  star hotel with service and accommodations that are good but not excellent  This hotel offers you nothing special and the staff is polite but not overly friendly  Amenities are alright but certainly nothing special as you would expect in a  star hotel  The gym facilities are inadequate and they allow you to access a gym facility which is nice  blocks away for a fee of  for each workout  They did not give us turn down service at night which is what you would expect at a quotclassyquot hotel  The front desk staff also made a comment that we made our reservations through an on line company and not directly through the hotel  Not sure what he meant to say but well      ill give them the benefit of the doubt  Honestly if you are looking to stay in a  star hotel and want royal treatment with great amenities i would look into another hotel  
P => Perfect   noise was minimal A friend and I booked this hotel last minute through hotwire night all in and it was absolutely perfect  The room was great   large well equipped clean and modern  The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge  The room had small touches that many hotels overlook   full length mirror great bathrobes good lighting plenty of towels heavy drapes that block out the morning light an umbrella in the closet etc  None of these things are particularly luxurious but they speak to the staffsmanagements understanding of hospitality  The hotel is pet friendly  I brought my dog and the staff loved him  The hotel bills itself as the most pet friendly hotel chain around so theres a good chance that part of the job is to pretend you like animals even if you dont  But either way they gave my dog a lot of attention and didnt bat an eye when he peed on the flower pot right in front of the hotel  They just smiled and washed it off  The website says its stay to bring your pet but they didnt charge us In addition to indulging my dog the staff was great for other reasons   just super friendly and helpful without being overbearing  I think the word Im looking for is quotprofessional quot The concierges were both great too   we took one of their two recommendations for dinner Mechant Boeuf   very good  I also got a recommendation from a friend for another restaurant Au Pied de Cochon   outstanding and the concierge got us in  It was early   PM   but we were still really pleased Others have mentioned that noise was a problem  We were on the second floor facing the street and noise really wasnt an issue  I wore earplugs on Friday night and slept like a baby  I went earplug free on Saturday night and I woke up for a second around AM but didnt have a problem falling back asleep  It really wasnt that loud   perhaps they have replaced the windows Or be its not an issue on lower floors because the bars are on the next block overI spend a lot of time researching hotels before I commit   I feel like half the fun of a vacation is the hotel  Note go to      to figure out which hotel you are getting through hotwire  This one didnt disappoint 
P => Great Rooms Amazing staff and a great location Just returned from a vacation at the Lowes and the hotel is great    The staff goes above and beyond in making you feel welcome and attending to your every need    The rooms are spacious and you sink right into the bed   Loved the bathroom with the oversize Jacuzzi tub   The concierge deserve a special mention as they gave us great recommendations for sightseeing as well as set us up with dinner reservations at some amazing restaurants that they recommended     Montreal is a great city and this hotel is the place to stay  
P => Nice but  Just came back from another Great trip to Montreal  What a great city Loews is in a great location and the rooms and the staff are great overall My only concerns were  we were in room   very noisy and almost seemed like the windows were open You can hear every partier on De La MontagneThe one thing I didnt like was when we booked we took a higher rate as we were getting a food and beverage credit of   They dont tell you that you cant use this in the restaurant and is only good for the barmini bar or room service The prices are of course outrageous so in fact you are getting very little for your money    plus tax and tip for a can of coke   Overall a nice hotel with a great location Ask for a room not facing De La Montagne    
P => Loews is lovely We stayed in a Loews hotel in Miami Beach and LOVED it and so we chose this hotel in Montreal and were not at all disappointed  The service was impeccable rooms wonderfully appointed and location was great for a little shopping  Street noise was our only complaint   we stay in NYC all the time and this definitely rivaled any noise weve ever experienced there  Bar patrons outside to smoke were noisy until the wee hours and reveling students from the nearby university were very loud using this street as a cut through  We stayed Wed Sun and while the weekend noise was slightly more intense it was lous all of the nights  Im sure requesting a room off of the street would do the trick  We are still very pleased with the Loews chain and would definitely return to any Loews in the future  
P => Superb service perfect location   Loews has it all Most hotels use location as a major incentive Loews didnt need that  The service was enough Since we had checked into the hotel late after a long flight we had been very tired and the clean rooms quick service and excellent amenities made us feel right at home  The rooms were well sized with large bathrooms  The hotel interior was not of a very modern design but thats what made gave it more character in my opinion The hotel  like others is a very short walk to the major tourist hotspots and a brief walk away from the tourist information center so that was helpful  The tour operators also do pickups from the hotel unless there is an event or a festival and the roads are blocked  The hotel is only a block or two away from Crescent street where quite a few of the barsrestaurants are located  The price of the rooms is reasonable for a  star hotel as i think there are other hotels who charge much more for mediocre service  The best part of the hotel was the staff who were always very courteous the in room dining was so good that you didnt feel like going out elsewhere  Would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quick weekend getaway as well  
P => It is nice enough for a night I stayed here recently with my niece who is in college  My expectations were through the roof as the rating is very high in Trip Advisor  The experience was just okay however  The rooms were clean  The hotel is bright  But the stay was not at all memorable  
P => Vogue Hotel I heart you I stayed in this lovely boutique hotel last     everything was fabulous from check in to check out  Even when we booked the room for this hotel the rate was set to jump  for the last  nights of our stay and when my dad asked if they could keep the rate the same they were more than happy to oblige I have been to Montreal quite a bit    started at the Queen Elizabeth and kind of bounced around since then to find the perfect hotel LOCATIONservice etc   I dont believe there is any other hotel except for be the one accross the street that can beat the location of Lhotel Vogue There certainly isnt one that can beat the quality in my opinion Myself and  of my family members were in Montreal for a concert last  Kanye West and I had heard good things about the Vogue so we ided to give it a try  We booked out one of the suites   I believe it was the quotexecutive suitequot   as there were  of us  in king bed  on king pull out and we were very pleased The layout included a spacious bedroom with a huge beautiful bathroom that had a jacuzi soaker tub and tons of counter space    a powder room area which connected the bedroom to the living room and as also very very spacious and included a dining area table for  and a kitchenettebar area with nice countertops fridge etc   It was LOVELY  there was also a half bath off the living area with a shower The staff greeted us by NAME and were so friendly even gave us a complimentary movie rental just to show their appreciation    I absolutely loved this place   I remember that there was internet but I cannot recall whether it was wireless or not   either way  no complaint in that department     at one point we had a problem with the alarm clock my dad is technologically challenged and they sent someone up within  minutes to fix it    very prompt servicerooms were clean I dont believe there was much of a view but on my top  list of things I require my hotel have  the view is on the bottom When you step outside the doors of the Vogue hotel you are LITERALLY about  steps from Ste Catherine street Which is amazing    only about a block from the great restaurant quoteggspectationquot    speaking of walking out the doors    the doormen were VERY polite and friendly and always remembered you I CANNOT WAIT to stay at the Vogue againIf I had to say anything else it would be more of a warning than a complaint   we found that for  ppl although the room had more than enough space it was a little tight getting everyone showered in the morning especially with  girls aged  and    It wasnt a big deal but as a picky hotel goer  you might keep this in mind Other than that   AMAZING 
P => One of the nicest places Ive stayed I travel quite a bit and am always on the lookout for upper range hotels with good prices  This is definitely one of those places  Nice location central to downtown Montreal amp close to subway great restaurants nearby  Hotel room was great booked a ior suite which had a huge bathroom two flat screens and nice comfortable bed though could have gotten a standard room and been just as happy  Great laundry service and lots of nice little amenities  for example cold fresh squeezed lemonade in the reception area on hot afternoons  Very helpful amp professional staff willing to help out wreservations for dinner  Nice lounge for people watching as well  Not a cheap place to stay but in this instance you get what you pay for amp more  
P => Very very nice Stayed one night at the Loews Hotel Vogue in early uary for touring Montreal  The location is great if youre all about shopping but not ideal if youre looking to tour Old Montreal  The hotel itself though was just terrific  Small enough that the staff which never seemed to number more than a handful were able to respond immediately to any question or concern that arose  The rooms were great and the bathrooms spectacular  Legitimate  star accommodations  Loews gimmick is having surprises for kids who stay and for our teenagers it was an envelope    with their names on them    with a card for some free mp downloads  A very cool move  The kids loved the place as did my wife and I  Id have no hesitation recommending this to anyone ever  
P => Enjoyed our stay here very much  nite stay at the lowes montreal great room wonderful bath wbigalthough usless jettedtub and arate shower  Fell in love with the city of Montreal  Well maintained clean beautiful public streets flowers planted everywhere  The room overlooked a cute but unused courtyard  Everyone was nice and friendly  Plus with lowes first membership level I get a  food and bev credit in addition to the per nite credit i got with booking the room  The room was slightly more than most other hotel rooms in the city that weekend but the accomodations were above average and with my bonus bucks thought it was an overall good deal  
P => Fantastic Great location nice hotelThis hotel is perfect as a base to visit Montreal  Nice big room  a so comfortable bed a great and clean bathroom  The staff was very helpful giving directions and more advice on local restaurants and must see  Definitely a good choice  
P => Loved it I love this hotel Every year my wife and I take a trip to Montreal to enjoy the Jazz Festival  Weve been going for  years and have stayed at the Vogue  years in a row  The service is second to none and the location is great even if the jazz festival is on the other side of Downtown  We always seem to spend a little too much money at Ogilvys but I guess its all part of the quotMontreal experiencequot Cant wait for next year 
P => WOW  STAY HERE I stayed at this hotel for four nights in ruary and was very very impressed  I travel to Montreal for business quite often but this is by far my favorite hotel in the city The service is great and the hotel is in a prime location But the piece de resistance had to be the bathrooms     very luxurious with plazma tvs and jacuzzis  The room was large and very vrey comfortable Highly recommend  
P => THE BEST My husband and I stayed at this hotel over the Labour Day weekend and I cant say enough We were looking for a hotel where we could take our dogs with us our canine kids but we didnt want to lose the luxury  We have a smaller mixed breed and a St  Bernard which can make it difficult to find a posher hotel  Did we ever find the best We couldnt believe how welcoming and friendly everyine was from the time we called the hotel to enquire to time we left The rooms are a great size with big windows and a big fluffy bed  The bathroom is the topper though  I almost wanted to spend the whole weekend soaking in the big jacuzzi tub watching the flatscreen tv mounted on the counter of the massive bathroom Gorgeous Every member of the staff that we met were so helpful and friendly  A pet bed and bowls were provided for our dogs on the first night with a smile  We picked this hotel because we could travel with our pets but I will return if Im travelling with or without them Loved it loved it loved it 
P => A lot to like about the Hotel Vogue We booked on Five Star Alliance  This was a great thing because the deal included free internet  otherwise  day for in room internet  Surprisingly for a top rated hotel our first room had a dirty carpet  We asked for and received a room change the next day and staff moved our things  Ask for an upper floor  Great location very friendly and helpful staff stylish super bathrooms  
P => if you are looking for the perfect get away What a wonderfu friendly and beautiful botique hotel right in the middle of Montreals shopping district and nearby McGill Univ The only negative thing to mention about the hotel is the carpeting in our room definitely needs to be replacedThe staff service etc  are all excellent  Leave your car at home or if you drive park it in the garage  You are in walking distance of everything  You will need to take a cab to old Montreal  So much to see and do there too  A very safe city to walk around Montreal is very very expensive due to the low value of the US dollar but it was still worth the tri 
P => Great Hotel Stayed here for  nights  Large Spacious room and good service located right in the center of Montreal  Highly Recomended 
P => Beautiful hotel great location Stayed here for a weekend getaway with my husband  Its in a nice location in the city near rue St  Catherine which is lined with shops  We had a premium king room which was orated in a modern style  At one end of the room near the TV you had a nice seating area  The bathroom was large with all black ble a jacuzzi tub and arate shower  
P => Everything was perfect Although we could have found a better hotel rate in Montreal for JazzFest we chose the Vogue based upon location and other reviews  We were extremely pleased  The staff was friendly and helpful the hotel was immaculate and our room was lovely and comfortable  We sprung for the premium room at a modest additional expense and found it to be perfect for us  It had a small foyer as you entered a well appointed and large ble bathroom and an attractive bedroom with a comfortable bed and top notch linens  The coffee machine was a Kreurig model dispensing a premium cup at a time  The hotel is located in a nice neighborhood with several good French bistros within a few blocks the fine art museum two blocks away and within a  minute walk or  metro stops to the JazzFest itself  On our departure day they were very willing to allow us a  pm late checkout  We were completely pleased with our stay  
P => Loews Does Not Disappoint  Excellent Stayed a night at Loews Hotel Vogue while on the way to Tremblant  Loved it so much we spent another night on the way back from Tremblant And we booked into the Vogue for our trip to Montreal later this month  So within a month we will have stayed at the Vogue three times  Thats how much we love this hotel Whats so greatThe location is great well not if you just want Old Montreal stuff  For that Id recommend the Gault  But for this part of town and Mont Royal this is wonderful Facilities very well maintained  Rooms are spacious and spotless  Lobby is inviting Our room had a jetted tub and arate shower  Bathroom was very large  Room was also large  TV in bathroom  VCRDVD in room  Three phones Nice welcoming amenities for Loews First members Everybody we encountered doorman bell staff front desk housekeeper restaurant people  ALL courteous and professional We returned three days later and the doorman recognized us and greeted us by name Nice touchThe service attitude at this hotel is really superb  Others should find out how they have such great service and learn from them This is not the cheapest hotel around even in its class but for what it gives us in service we just love it here again unless we are visiting Old Montreal Had lunch at the Cellini the hotel restaurant  Good prices and good quality and very friendly staff  Would recommend Concierge contacted us way before our arrival and asked for age of our kids  They prepared a nice welcoming gift for them as well  Nice touch We asked the concierge by email to help us make dinner reservations  Quick and accurate  Very prompt and courteous service We will be back 
P => Good Stay at the Vogue We stayed here for part two of our honeymoon and found this to be a perfectly nice hotel  It was great for a city location had nice staff was very clean and we had a nice big room  This is not a historic hotel so the ambiance is newer  But the hotel in reality was what we expected from the Web site when we booked They were very nice and had chocolate covered strawberries for us when we arrived very sweet  We had some really good room service and the hotel restaurant was really good  We were able to sightsee from this hotel very easily and its in a nice shopping area  Overall no complaints  Your basic nice hotel 
P => We loved it We Had  nights at the Vouge Found the staff very freindly and helpfull A great location and easy to get around Do your self a favour and get a bath pillow  I found one at the BS on St Catherine  Made the spa that much more enjoyable especially after walking to the top of Mount Royal Note if you walk from the hotel to the top of Mount Royal allow hrs return  Room service was great cant comment on the restauarant as we never ate there Loved this Hotel and thanks again Trip Advisor 
P => Fantastic short break hotel Stayed at the Loews for  nights and really can not fault it  We  adults are from London UK and after seeing Toronto we chose The Loews Hotel Vogue following TripAdvisor recommendations before going onto Vancouver for the rest of our vacation We found the Loews location very convenient  Short walk to the main shopping street and about a   min stroll to old Montreal which for us given the spring like weather was lovely  Hotel staff could not have been more helpful coffeemini bar replenished every day turn down service and we were on a regular room rate booked via TripAdvisor hotel check rates  Now we have arrived home we wished that we had spent less time in Toronto and more time in Montreal  However they say a good city always leaves you wanting more 
P => Not a bad choice if youre able to book a good rate  Weve stayed here for  nights and were able to get a good deal through the hotel website  If we had paid more I probably wouldnt have given it this rating The hotel is conveniently located right in the middle of the centre on a relatively quiet side street of the busy Rue de Ste  Catherine  The lobby looks beautiful but is quite small  Everytime you enter and leave the hotel a nice door man opens the door for you  That does give a bit of a  star feeling which this hotel is supposed to be The room itself wasnt anything special  or from the late s with a matching TV volume went up and down for no reason a view of the hotel right across the street no seating area with a table besides the working desk which isnt quite suitable for having dinner in your room  The bathroom was quite big modern and very clean though  The beds were quite good Matresses not too firm or too soft  The minibar hasnt been restocked once during our entire stay not even after weve left the minibar key in the room  The coffee cups though were replenished after we did that so perhaps thats a tip for future visitors   The hotel bar is incredibly small and not much fun  The restaurant is very expensive so we didnt eat there  Room service is nothing special the usual stuff youd expect staying at a hotel of this caliber with prices to match Staff is extremely friendly sometimes a bit too much if you ask me  It felt somewhat phoney a couple of times If youre a member of their Loews First Program and youve selected the  minibar credit as the gift check your bill The gift wasnt deducted from our bill but we didnt see that until we were well on our way to the airport All in all not bad at all but not really  stars either  The good deal on the room rate made up for all of the  flaws  but that s it basically  
P => Great Service Fantastic Location Needs a Few Updates    I just returned from the Loews Hotel Vogue in Montreal  It was my first trip to this fantastic city and the Vogue is in a very good location for easy access to many of the best restaurants shops and Mont Royal  Old Montreal and other areas are just a quick cab ride away I have to give the Vogue a  star rating regarding service   friendly helpful and a great welcome to the city  Other than the location other positives were the very attentive bell staff and doormen a top notch bartender in the lounge and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever experienced What keeps me from giving it an overall  star rating is that the or was a bit dated bathroom in particular though the size was excellent and the hotel does not have wireless internet in   Apparently theyre working on it but the wireless signal I was picking up in the lobby was from the hotel across the street  I couldve given them a little slack on that but not when I found out that the plug in internet access at the desk in my room was day  I really enjoyed the Vogue and felt the night was pretty reasonable on a busy and gorgeous weekend though after walking around the city and seeing some of the other choices Id likely give the Sofitel or W or one of a few other highly rated hotels Ive seen here on TripAdvisor a try the next time around  
P => Outstanding Hotel Had a fantastic time at this hotel   staff were great and could not do enough for me and my girlfriend   who had only just broken her leg at Mont Tremblant and had spent the last   days in Montreal General Hospital Reception staff were great  We had reserved one of the suites which was well worth it  Room Service was out of this world too   pure gluttonyIt was a lot of money for us but it was worth any penny and would do it again in a heart beat For a holiday that started so well on the slopes included a very sore and traumatic middle because of the leg it ended sweetly with our stay here  
P => No complaints here We stayed for a week in a suite and it was perfect  Great hotel service    good or   personal touches  big rooms    room service good not great   on site restaurant nothing that memorable   friendly and helpful concierge   great two ble bathrooms    would definitely recommend  downside internet access can be reached at the two computers in the lobby but if not you have to pay   for WiFi a day   
P => Wonderful experience at Loews Hotel Vogue To celebrate our birthdays I took my mom to Montreal  We stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue and were incredibly impressed  The hotel has an antique ish vibe but all of the rooms are well sized nicely appointed very clean and well kept  I had a corner room with an adjoining living space  My mom and I stayed in the bedroom and my brother slept on the pull out sofa on the living room side  Because I am a member of their rewards program I received a complimentary local gift upon arrival  I highly recommend that you sign up for their free rewards program in advance of your stay to take advantage of some of their benefits  Im a person who makes hotel isions based on the look of the bathroom and I definitely made the right ision  The bathrooms are fantastic It was almost as large as the bedroom with a vanity area and arate shower stall but the best part is the tub  I travel quite frequently for work and I can honestly say that it was the largest jacuzzi tub Ive ever seen in a hotel  Though I never used it my mom and brother raved about it  Theyd never been to Montreal before but felt that the jacuzzi tub made it all worthwhile I cant say enough about the place  The prices were reasonable and the rooms were great plus the hotel is centrally located less than a block away from St  Catherine   one of the major shopping destinations in the city  The only quotslightlyquot down side was the hotel restaurant  While the food was enjoyable the prices were abit high  All told I highly recommend staying at this hotel  
P => Only thing more you could ask for would be free Wi Fi in rooms The location is great the staff is friendly and helpful the rooms are tastefully and well appointed etc  My only peeve is that they think they can get away with charging  day for wired internet  Dont they realize this is  The Hotel de la Montagne next door has free Wi Fi  
P => Luxery room excellent service and delicious food I stayed at Hotel Vogue for a shopping weekend in Montreal and it did not disappoint  From the lobby to my room itself it is probably the nicest and most luxurious hotels Ive stayed in  The bathroom was a dream equipped with tv and jacuzzi tub  The service was excellent when the moment I stepped in  Everyone was very friendly and polite  I ordered room service for dinner and the food was delicious  shopping is just steps away which is great  nice to have a dvd in the room too  For a luxury shopping weekend in Montreal or a romantic getaway I would definitely recommend Hotel Vogue  
P => Our Favorite in Montreal My husband and I take quick over night trips to Montreal and this is our very favorite Hotel  You are right off Ste  Catherine and all the wondrful shopping and with walking distance to some yummy french bistrosThe beds are like heaven  From the time you arrive you are treated as if you are really wanted there  I love this hotel 
P => Everything I hoped for and more Two of us stayed from il th at this hotel and it was wonderful  Cant say enough about their service  Concierge was fabulous and really helped us newcomers to Montreal  The hotel itself has an incredible location close to McGill and lots of shopping  Old Montreal would be about a  minute walk The room great with luxury bedding and lots of room  The bathroom as youve seen in pictures on this site was incredible  Huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub and flat screen tv for watching as you soak  There is a rate shower  The bathrobes are a nice touch when you are away Turn down service every night made things even more special Ive stayed at alot of hotels with my work and this really had some of the best service that I have received  
P => Loews Vogue   Still in Vogue The Loews Vogue is a classic smaller luxury hotel in downtown Montreal  My family  adults kids aged  stayed there ch     The purpose of the trip was to explore the largest French speaking city outside of Paris   and to overcome the inability to acquire travel to someplace southThe rooms   adjoining for us   were not large but comfortable and luxurious  Large bathrooms comfotable beds and or with DVD players etc   What I really enjoyed was the quality of the service  The concierges were fantastic and could not do enough for us  They helped with many questions and offered wonderful suggestions for dinner or even how to experience museums We had breakfast each day in the restaraunt and Gerard took wonderful care of us  He took an interest in our family offered ideas and even had small gifts for the kids   all hockey fans   the day we left  The food   breakfast only for us   was very good at the Hotel The lobby bar was a bit overpriced for the one drink we had there Would highly recommend this hotel   and my wife and I would certainly return   alone 
P => Overrated You get what you expect w a  star hotel namely friendly service they recommended good places to eat and watch the Canadiens game and a clean room  You also get a good location if you would like to spend time in the quotAngloquot area of Montreal  However you also get the worst of the chain hotel experience  Namely a knife in the back or in this case wallet every step of the way   daily for parking and   for the bottle of water they leave in the room  I find both over the top  Particularly the water  In addition I stupidly forgot my cell phone charger in the room and when I called the next day to see if they could mail to me they did not have it  So the cleaning staff either took it not sure why they would do that or else lazily threw it in the garbage  Guess it doesnt really matter since they would have probably charged me the cost of buying a new one to mail it  
P => Beautiful hotel with great service First of all thank you to the Trip Advisor contributors  We booked this hotel after reading the reviews and couldnt have been happier  My husband I and our three pre teen to teenaged kids loved our weekend stay in Montreal at Loews  This is a beautiful centrally located hotel with fabulous service the combination of posh or and top notch staff cant be beat  The car valets doormen and front desk staff were all very friendly the kids loved the huge jars of M amp Ms with scoops at the front desk they were each also presented with a personalized note and a voucher for a free in room movie during our stay   they truly felt welcomed here  Our quiet clean connecting rooms featured two doubles connecting to a queen bed with a canopy which worked perfectly for us  Though a bit on the small side as has been mentioned these are gorgeous rooms with high ceilings and well thought out amenities   flat screen TV comfortable bed with a crisp white duvet minibar coffee maker with take out cups and lids desk closet with safe etc    so the size was certainly not a problem  The only negative was our view of the roof of the next building  If I get the chance to visit again I would request a street view  The bathrooms are fantastic    large ble everywhere jacuzzi tub arate shower plenty of counter space two hair dryers one in the bathroom one outside it at the small vanity area nice toiletries and another flat screen TV viewable from the tub We enjoyed a drink at the lobby bar in the evenings while the kids watched their free movies   again impeccable service  Loews is in the midst of downtown dining and shopping including the large underground out of the weather shopping areas entrance  blocks away  The concierge recommended two good restaurants also within walking distance Le Taj for Indian food small portions but very tasty   great naan and Le Pois Penche for upscale French bistro fare great service and ambience and both welcomed the kids  Egg Spectations for brunch which is just a block or so away is not to be missed  The Italian restaurant on the premises looked good but we did not eat there  We also were a quick walk away from the Musee des Beaux Arts and took in the fine Cuban Art expedition We really couldnt ask for more and would definitely stay here again 
P => Fantastic Hotel Recently returned from a weekend trip to Montreal to see the BruinsCanadiens game in which we stayed at the Loews Hotel  The hotel was situated perfectly for us due to the fact we wanted to be close to St  Catherine s Street and the Bell Centre  The room was spacious clean and nicely orated  The bathroom was extremely large with a Jacuzzi tub and stand up shower  The small flat screen tv also in the bathroom was a great amenity  Getting back to location the hotel is a stones throw from St  Catherine s Peel and Crescent Streets  Which means you are close to all the shops bars and clubs  Another nice option was the  hr room service  After a night of drinking on Crescent Street we needed something in our stomachs and ordered some food  They took no more than  minutes to deliver it up to us  The staff is polite and courteous and the concierge was extremely helpful in helping us find restaurants and booking reservations  I have stayed at a few other hotels in Montreal including both riotts and my Loews experience has been far better than the others  I would stay at no other location  Montreal is a great city with a European feel  Everyone is very trendy and extremely polite  As Bruins fans we were not even harassed at the game well be a few boos when I was cheering when the B s scored  Though I love the city and again I would stay no other place than Loews  
P => Fabulous family stay Spent a lovely weekend at Loews Hotel Vogue   during a major Montreal blizzard   with my husband and two teenagers  Booked the ior Suite and it was perfect for four    good sized rooms Bedroom and living room with  full baths  The hotel provided a rollaway as well  Immaculate quiet and great housekeeping services  The staff from the concierge to the bellman to the bartender to the front desk people were all wonderful  We sipped hot chocolate in front of a roaring fire in the lobby while the snow fell and the wind blew in mph gusts down the street in front of the hotel  Great location for shopping restaurants and sightseeing all of which we managed to do despite the snow  Vieux Montreal was lovely  Ogilvy right across the street from the hotel is a truly fantastic department store  We would definitely stay at another Loews hotel after this experience  
P => Great for couples My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in uary for a weekend getaway  and we loved it We felt like we were staying somewhere really special with this one  Our room had a beautiful and comfortable canopy bed and an enormous bathroom with its own television shower and arate jetted bathtub  There was also a vanity mirror in the hallway connecting the door and the room  The room was very large and extremely beautiful  The hotel staff was so friendly and we ended up talking with the bell boy for quite a while  The location right near St  Catharine on Rue LaMontagne is great for tourists because of the plethora of bars and restaurants that are located just a block away on Crescent Street  We very much enjoyed this weekend getaway and would stay at Loews again 
P => Great for a quick weekend getaway I stayed at this hotel just for a weekend but I wish that I could have stayed longer   its fantastic from start to finish After a quick cab ride from the airport check in was very efficient and the staff were very pleasant and aiming to please  Before you go sign up for the Loews First frequent guest program on the companys website and you get a choice of a quotwelcome giftquot every time you stay at a Loews property I chose red wine and mixed nuts   a nice pick me up before dinner  The room a jr  suite was beautiful with a canopy queen sized bed lighted make up vanity outside the bathroom and a fantastic ble bathroom with erate shower jacuzzi and TV  Rooms are serviced twice a day and the turn donw service is a treat  I didnt eat at the hotel so I cant comment on the food but the lobby bar is a great place for a tini and some great people watching The location of the property is very convenient  I was attending a hockey game at the Bell Centre only a  min  walk away  Rue St  Catherine and Rue Crescent are right nearby and have lots of options for bars restaurants and shopping  I will definetly choose this hotel when I am in Montreal again   it was stylish and serene with great service  
P => Unique and upscale This boutique hotel in the heart of Montreal was ideally located  Head one way and youre at the St Lawrence the other way and youre at Mount Royal a great place to walk The room was comfortable the jet tub in the bathroom a much welcomed relief after all of the walking we did in Mount Royal This is considered a quotboutiquequot hotel   which from my experience is an older property thats made some upgrades but none too extensive  The highlights Francine at the LOpera Bar a small lounge near the hotels elevators  Francine was friendly and accommodating and remembered what we drank every visit  
P => Very good  Excellent A solid  star  No other  star compares including the Fairmont Chateau Champlain etc   My only complaint is that the barmaid in the lobby says quottuquot instead of quotvousquot which I think is disrespectful  
P => Unbeatable   Absolutely Spectacular Loews Hotel Vogue is a GemMy most recent stay was flawless from check in to check out The hotel itself is very beautiful The location is unbeatable  Loews is easily accessed from both the train and bus station as well as the airport  The local metro is also close by The lobby is warm and cozy There are always little treats and current newspapers available The internet access is a great feature very convenient for checking your email etc   The staff are all very friendly and informative They are extremely knowlegable and are eager to answer any questions you  have The rooms are a perfect size They offer plenty of space for all kinds of luggage shopping bags and so on There is a well sized entry to the room closet vanity and workspace The beds are very comfortable and the sheets are divineThe nightly turn down service is lovely The bathroom is gorgeous and huge I might add They are very clean with plenty of amenities The jet tub is like an oasis after a long day of shopping The flat screen t v  is a nice touch There is great sized shower with good water temperature and pressure Loews offers a wide variety of guest services Reading the long list really confirms that they have your best interest in mind They offer services that would benefit all types of travellers  Whether it be a business traveller a couple or a family Judging from the list they have anticiapted your every need and desire I have stayed at multiple hotels in Montreal and a fare share of others across the globe and Loews stands tall everytimeLowes is by far my favorite hotel in Montreal I would never consider staying anywhere else  
P => Awesome Stay   Again What a great hotel in a wonderful location  We have stayed here many times over the past few years and have never been disappointed  The rooms are spacious and VERY quiet and the bathroom has a arate walk in shower  Everything is spotless and the service from the front desk to room service to the doorman and valet is top notch  We return to find the same friendly faces working in this hotel which definitely says something about the way Loews treats their employees  We cant wait to go back Superb    
P => Bijou of a hotel in the centre of a lovely city This is a plush small romantic and luxury boutique hotel in downtown Montreal just minutes walk from the best shops and restaurants  Ive stayed here twice this year during erate months and enjoyed it both times I recommend room  with a four poster double bed large work desk spacious bel bathroom with jacuzzi bath  This is one of the best hotel rooms Ive ever stayed in  The staff here are helpful too  I left a pair of shoes in the room and they mailed them to my address in Toronto straight away I saved a lot by booking my room here on the Five Star Alliance website and got free internet access which is normally an extra charge  
P => Great hotel for kids I absolutely love this hotel  I have stayed here twice in the last few months once with my husband and once with my mom and I wont even consider staying anywhere else for future trips to Montreal The hotel is gorgeous and the staff go out of their way to ensure that guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay The rooms are so comfortable with plush pillows duvets and nice sheets  The whirlpool with the flat screen tv is also great for relaxing after a day of shopping and walking around Valet parking is  which is on the higher end for Montreal   hotels seem to range from   but I know my car is safe in a private underground parkade The restaurant isnt very good and I dont recommend eating there  We didnt eat there this last visit but I ate there in ust when I was traveling with my husband and my infant dhter because it was pouring and we didnt want to leave the hotel  Our dinner was  and we only had one drink each  My husband had a steak and there were so many cuts in it to check if it was cooked it looked like something that came off of dads bbq not something youd expect in a restaurant  I have to give credit to the service though and the waiter brought plain pasta for my dhter at no charge The hotel staff also provided exceptional service  Their slogan Loews loves kids holds true as they have a contract with Fisher Price so you can borrow toys during your stay  I requested a couple of toys when we arrived and when we returned to our room there was a potty  I have a one year old and I did not want her playing with a potty I called the front desk and one of the staffers returned to our room  times with different toys a push toy a xylophone and another musical toy Loews is in an excellent location between St Catharine and Sherbrooke  I love this hotel and I highly recommend it 
P => Potentially great boutique hotel but    This is a potentially great boutique hotel   great rooms excellent staff very comfortable BUT I resent having to pay extra for water and internet which other comparable hotels The Nelligan Le Germain throw in  It just feels like Im being nickled and dimed to death  Other posters have made the same comments and Im hoping that Le Vogue is listening   Im heading back there tonight Otherwise its a terrific hotel in a great location whether youre in Montreal for business or pleasure  
P => Great Hotel Great hotel In a great location Had meetings in the hotel great facility for this Stayed     Again location was great close to shopping night clubs and the underground  On stie restaurant was good the bar in the lobby is packed at night  Easy check in very friendly staff secure hotel business center is convenient free use of computer and printing in room internet is  per day Rooms were large bed was comfy bathroom large shower could stand for an update  ipod alarm clock in room was nice  No complaints and would stay here again Other restaurants that were not too far and food was great   Version Newton Primadonna  
P => quick trip to Montreal My girlfriend and I went to Montreal recently  She mainly went for the shopping and I went for the food The hotel was great for shopping as it is just off Rue St  Catherines  We were within walking distance of several malls such as Eaton Center and Montreal Trust building  The Holt Renfrew Department store was really nice and in addition the hotel was directly across the street to Ogilvys Department store I will review the restaurants arately  The hotel restaurant was excellent  The concierge was great with suggestions and help with reservations  We were lucky to be upgraded to a very nice suite but the regular room with a king bed seemed very comfortable  The only problem was the construction outside which led to some noise during the working hours  We totally loved Montreal and would like to come back  
P => Generally fine experience but a couple of sour notes Spent  nights at the Hotel Vogue chosen on basis of strong TripAdvisor reviews  Rooms are large comfortable and very attractive  Bathroom was huge and very nicely appointed  Staff were friendly helpful and professional a very nice mix  I particularly commend the doormen I paid night   in taxes which is the AAA rate  When the US dollar is strong this hotel is a bargain at parity we are approaching NYC rates My quibbles are that at this rate I would expect internet access in rooms to be free not  to use a wire wireless in the lobby is through a vendor that seems to want you to buy minutes  I relied on my Blackberry instead and the free computers in the lobby  Those loby computers complete with free printing are a nice touch There is a breakfast buffet laid out in the restaurant   or so for fruit cereal juice coffee coldcuts cheese and yogurt  Not bad not generous OK heres a pet peeve others  not share I strongly resent the bottle of water in the room that costs    Yes I know by know most experienced travelers have seen this trap  But it seems wrong for hotels to lay traps for quotguestquot    for the bottle and the have the snotty temerity to add quotEnjoyquot to the label  More fundamentally these days we are all subject to incredible demands on our attention  airports airplance hotel rooms all full of ads and commercials  In the room we really deserve a little TLC which would in this instance translate into not having to read every label to know what peril lies within As for the minibar which I think had some device that would indicate if it had been opened let alone accessed   you would not find my fingerprints on that one Heres a tip If you head down Ste Catherine and turn left on St  Denis  about a mile walk or a couple of metro stops  a few doors up the street and on your right you will encounter iette au Chocolat a shop that serves truly extraordinary chocolat in almost every imaginable form  I am not given to hyperbole I think your cup of hot chocolate  be white milk semi sweet or several grades of dark with cocoa  s given served in the classic or quotanciennequot Grandmas style  with a few fair trade options to salve the conscience   There are also chocolates to take home chocolate brownies fondue crepes etc  So enjoy Loews and consider a stop at iettes if you enjoy fine chocolate on a cool day  Oh I understand the lines can be lone at night so try afternoon to avoid disappointment Bon appetit 
P => The Gold Standard of Boutique Hotels I travel to Montreal on business   times a year  I have tried a couple of other hotels just for diversity but there is no reason to stay anywhere else in this city  Heres whyLocation Un the heart of downtown near shopping with easy access to expressways that can get you anywhere within minutesI have stayed at some of the boutique hotels near Old Montreal but I find that location a bit isolated  Rooms  The rooms are always nice but on this last visit I had a room that somehow seemed bigger and recently reated  It was beautiful and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom  The bed is extremely comfortable and the linens are top notch Value The overall experience is  star without question at  star prices  That does not happen too often in todays world Service  The highest standard I have ever seen  Everyone addresses you by name  They cant do enough for you  The room service is the fastest I have ever had and very good  The small bar is really warm and friendly and always busy at cocktail hour humming with nicely dressed people  In fact a few years ago they were filming a movie in Montreal and many of the actors were staying at the Vogue and I was invited to a private party at the Vogue Bar and was served a tini by George ClooneyTrue story The concierege will go out of his way for you  On this trip I was extremely busy with appointments but needed to find a particular bottle of French wine with a hard to find vintage year of  that I was unable to locate in my home city  I called the concierge and he tracked down two bottles for me  It was delivered back to the hotel and wrapped for transport back to Toronto They also seem to keep their staff a long time  The doormen have been there for many years and I continually recognize other staff  They are clearly doing something right on many levels Bottom Line There is no need to stay anywhere else in Montreal  
P => Consistently Excellent Ive been vacationing in Montreal for the past  years and I can safely say the Vogue is the best downtown hotel  The staff is superb and they always seem genuinely happy to go the extra mile Example   Shortly after entering my room the front desk called and mentioned that the bell hop thought the room was rather dry so they offered to send up a humidifier  I experienced that level of attention throughout multiple visits to the Vogue  This attention also extends to room service which is extremely prompt and the menu has something for everyone    my girlfriend thought the three cheese pasta was the best pasta shed ever had Rooms are big and clean with massive bathrooms that contain a bath many with tvs and arate standing shower  The mini bar is very extensive and they include plenty of snacks that actually taste good The location is unbeatable  Right off St  Catherine st  in the heart of the always active downtown area  Everything you want is within walking distance including the metro And if you like to feel secure during your stay youre in luck  This is the only hotel I know of to require a room key in order to use the elevator Overall one of the best hotel experiences in Montreal  
P => Great Hotel Lovely clean and upscale  Large ble bathroom had a tv whirlpool tub and arate shower  Helpful staff clean and comfy bed  Will stay there again  
P => First time at the Vogue and going back later this month As the title of my reviews suggest it I liked it so much I will be going back on my next visit to Montreal What a great hotel If you look at my profile youll notice that Im a Montreal regular and usually go a few times in the summer  Im also a Priceline regular but this time I wanted to indulge and it was also the Nascar AND Pride week end in Montreal which meant few hotels had availabilty  Found a good rate at the Loews and jumped on it and boy was I ever glad I did What makes this hotel so special certainly is its high level of personalized yet not overpretentious service  Of course you have its great rooms too From the moment we walked in the door to our departure we had everything we could have wanted  Bellman always there to greet you nice fresh cut flowers in the relatively small but elegant lobby  Check in and concierge staff were gracious and made us feel at home  They were professional yet not cold and too distant like the often case of large chain hotels  Such a constrast with the Sheraton I stayed at a few weeks before a few blocks from there  Cannot say enough good things about the staff  I called them back to book again for late ust and the lady at the reservation office was equally helpful and you can just tell they like what they do The hotel might not have a pool or many services but its rooms are heavenly  Certainly not dated but rather orated in a more classice way  Our furniture was in a good repair  The housekeeping and cleanliness top notch  They vacuum around the edges  The bed was the best I slept in so far this year liked it better than Westins heavenly bed  The pillows were equally amazing I would have all brought them back home but then housekeeping would have noticed    Kidding aside bathroom equally great despite the shower being more ordinary than is some other prestigious hotels but still fine in my book  Im a Loews First member and all my preference were accomodated and the wine and nuts promptly sent up to the room  We had a queen room with a four poster bed overlooking De la Montage which others found noisy but I did not  Drapes keep the room pitch dark its quite amazing  There is an iHome iPod compatible radio in the room If you have one The location is great we were in town for Divers Cit  and even if this hotel is relatively far from the Gay village its an easy subway or cab ride away M tro is two blocks away Peel  In fact its proximity to Ste Catherine and Crescent is a big plus for some  We had a good time on top of Lhotel de la Montagne patios on the rooftop across the street  Nice spot for a quick eatdrink on a sunny summer afternoon I was very sad to leave this wonderful hotel and bed for home  I cannot wait to be back later this month and am ready to make it my only home away from home in Montreal  
P => th time at the Vogue  Still the best  This is the fourth time we have stayed at the Hotel Vogue  We always look forward to staying there and were not disappointed  The staff is wonderfully courteous and efficient  Our room was nicely appointed  We had a package that included parking and room service breakfast which was very nice  US newspapers are delivered to your door each morning  Location is great near galleries museums and McGill  We will be back  
P => What a great place to stay My friend and I ided to go shopping in Montreal last ch sorry for the delay in writing this  Neither of us had very much experience with Montreal hotels so after internet searches we ided to stay at the Vogue  We were totally unprepared for the Vogue experience We flew into Montreal and arriving early at the hotel we were concerned that we would have to wait hours to get into our room  While checking in a hotel guest who was sitting in the lobby asked us if it was our first time here When we answered yes he said quotwell it wont be your last you will never stay anywhere else in Montrealquot  My friend and I just smiled and looked at each other rather skeptically as we were not particularly impressed with the lobby  It was clean but small and unassuming  Anyway our room was available and we drilled the fellow who brought out bags to our room  He was soooo knowledgeable about the city and spent at least twenty minutes with us providing shopping and restaurant tips  I could go on and on but the long and short of it   the doorman and all of the bellmen knew we were there to shop and became quite excited when we came back with bags and equally disappointed when we returned empty handed We dined one night at the hotel restaurant  The service was impeccable and food superb  The amuse bouche was wonderful The hotel barThe hotel bar After the third night of going there for a nightcap we became regulars as were   of the people there  Everyone knew each other as they all had been coming to the hotel for years and the bartender knew them on a first name basis  I happened to mention to someone that my husband was a scuba diver   the next thing I knew everyone in the bar was involved in a discussion about scuba diving and providing me tips of the best diving sites in the world to pass onto my husband  Honestly it is like a small friendly community As far as our room  It was large and clean  Two very comfortable queen sized beds with lots of room for our luggage and to sit and relax  The bathroom was fabulous  It was enormous with a large jacuzzi tube arate shower and ble vanity  The room also had a lit vanity mirror and second hairblower in the hallway  This was a bonus for two femalesThe location is great for shopping   right across the street from Ogilvies Holt Renfrew is a short walk with lots of boutiques along the way and St  Catherines Street is very close  Alsothe location is a short cab ride to Old Montreal for shopping or dining One tip   on arriving at the Montreal airport we ided to pay a bit more than the flat fee taxi fare I cant remember how much and take a limousine to the hotel  We had ided to take a limo back to the airport but found out that there is a huge increase in limo fares from Montreal back to the airport My friend and I are going back to the Vogue in the fall 
P => lovely people lovely hotel Great hotel with large clean rooms  My room had a large tub with jets and a tv so I became completely addicted to a nightly soak and movie  I didnt ask for much but the hitel staff that I interacted with was friendly and helpful  Stayed last year at the Sofitel which is just a few blocks away  Also a good experience although they insisted on making up my room everyday despite the fact I put my quotdo not disturbquot sign up every morning  The only down side to either of these hotels is that theyre located in the business distract which is less than quaint if thats what youre looking for  Location is convenient for metro or taxi though Id happily recommend the Loews to friends and probably stay again  
P => Most satisfying hotel experience EVER We have travelled extensively around North America and I can say without reservation that this was the most satisfying experience that Ive had  Yes Ive stayed at properties that have bigger rooms or more luxurious surroundings but looking at value amenities location and service all together this hotel is head and shoulders above the rest  An important note we took the advice noted below and requested a room on a high floor toward the back of the building and we received this with no problem The room itself is very nicely appointed with a large bathroom that contains a whirlpool tub with television and a arate shower  There are two hair dryers one outside the bathroom at a vanity which really speeded things up in the morning  The bedding is high quality cotton with down duvets  We were impressed that they offered twice daily maid service  very nice not to have to reuse wet towels in the morning  The service at the front desk was friendly and prompt  I speak French but all of the people I spoke to were fluently bilingual  The location of this hotel could not be any more convenient to the main shopping area of rue Ste  Catherine  We did not eat at the hotel so I cant comment on the restaurant We will definitely be finding an excuse to go back to Loews Hotel Vogue  
P => Loved This Hotel Just got back from New York and Montreal  I loved Hotel Vogue  The rooms are great in size style and comfort and you couldnt ask for better service   the staff is exceptional  Great value for your money  Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again   one of my best hotel experiences  
P => Great stay at Hotel Vogue My husband and I spent a long weekend in Montreal and enjoyed our stay at Hotel Vogue  The service at the hotel is outstanding  The bathrooms are large and were always stocked with plenty of towels  The rooms are large and clean My only complaint about the hotel was the noise from the street  The hotel is a block away from Crescent and the noise from the bars on Friday and Saturday night got a little loud  
P => Best service in Montreal This was my third trip to Montreal this year Ive lost count at how many in the last few years all on business  Ive been looking at the Loews Vogue for awhile and this time I booked it  All I can say is I finally found a hotel with great staff good beds and first class housekeeping all in a really good location  I had a suite with what the hotel calls an urban view   code for no view  Didnt matter as I was out all day and preferred the quiet away from the noise of busy Rue de la Montagne  I could actually sleep  The hotel is only  floors so there are no great views from any room  I had two fellow travelers there as well and their rooms were on low floors and faced Montagne so they had lots of noise  The living room area was very large but had no windows as it was in a corner area  Now that I wasnt crazy about  I could have done with less space but lots of windows  The dining table made for great meeting space  There was a quot flat screen with a DVD player and surround sound  A guest bath was handy as we worked for most of the afternoon The bedroom was about the size of their Premium room and had a king bed desk with a good chair lots of phones and a small club chair for sitting  Nice  inch TV with DVD built in  Good radioCD player clock in the rooms  The bath was huge but that did take away for the room space  Two narrow windows  One of my fellow travelers had a Deluxe room  standard  and said it was small for him and his wife  All had nice appointments and though not new the furnishings and carpets were spotless and well maintained  The Opera Bar off the lobby had excellent drinks and offered light meals  I didnt try the restaurant as Cresent St with lots of choices is just a block over  Eggspectations was half a block in one direction and St Cathrines half a block in the other  Old Montreal is a cab ride away so this hotel is not as well placed as many for those visiting on vacation Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful  Better than the Omni Sofitel or the Ritz  Turn down service included fresh towels  The only thing I didnt like besides the lack of windows in the living room was no wi fi  I really wish hotels would do two things   include internet access in the rate  I pay enough for the room so PLEASE stop charging me    tax per day  and   have wi fi OR hard wire choices in the rooms  I like to sit on a sofa or love seat and work in comfort  The other thing was a tiny shower stall in the guest bath  The main bath had a jetted tub with a hand held shower  Not my favorite after a long day so I used the little stall instead The Loews Vogue made a believer of me  And if for no other reason the great staff I will go back even if its only a standard room  Two thumbs way up  
P => OK but ONLY because I got a great deal The only reason I chose to stay at this hotel for a weekend in  was because only this and one other hotel in the city offer special benefits through my credit card  Next time I probably will forgo my credit card benefits and stay at another hotel as I noticed there are many others that appear to be newer and more luxurious The hotel was an excellent value for what I paid  I was upgraded through my credit card to a one bedroom suite with two bathrooms with useless flat panel tvs above the tubs  all for the price of the cheapest room  The view was of another building across an ugly alley but that was fine since the room was large and adequate although dated no flat screen TVs in the main room fancy radios or updated light fixtures bedding etc  The room also seemed a bit worn around the edges and the condition of the carpet was only so so  It was like an airport Hilton that hadnt been updated since the mid s and without ble bathrooms I don t want to come off sounding like a snob but a hotel rated this high should be a lot nicer  Especially since it was voted Trip Advisor s best luxury in Montreal  This hotel is by no means bad but it absolutely CANNOT be the best luxury hotel in Montreal  It needs a loving overhaul  The lobby was small but nice with two computers for free internet  Valet was  CAD a night and I did notice that there were some public parking lots nearby  There is no hotel driveway so your car is left double parked in the street and they hurry you through like crazy to free up the space  Room service arrived on time and was presented nicely  I was happy with the amount of salmon that came with the lox and bagel selection Every staff member I interacted with was extremely friendly and helpful   especially housekeeping Next time I will either stay in a boutique hotel in the Old PortOld Montreal area or the glitzy Sofitel on Sherbrooke every time our cabdrove us by the Sofitel I strangely felt drawn to it   it was modern and definitely looked good  The Loews Vogue wasnt terrible and youll have a fine time but there are better options in Montreal  If you do stay here join the Loews loyalty club on their website for the perks  
P => Very good service We just loved our recent stay at the Vogue The service is always very good the location is great and they have those small attentions that make a difference they let a bag in our car with  apples and  bottles of water for the road The breakfast room service was delicious We just cant wait to go back 
P => Spacious Rooms Great Location Stayed at Hotel Vogue in a ior Suite with our two young children in early   We usually reserve suites when our family travels together and this Suite in comparison to others we have stayed in was extremely spacious and well appointed  We really appreciated the  full bathrooms and all of the extra space The Hotel was very centrally located and within walking distance to many restaurants and stores Service was very attentive in the Hotel although we found the waitstaff in the main dining room at breakfast a little supercilious  I did not feel that quotLOEWS Loves Kidsquot in the Dining Room at the Hotel Vogue  Room service was prompt helpful when we ordered our childrens meals and asked for different options than offered on the menu and ent in quality I would definitely recommend this Hotel for families  My kids loved the big jar of MampMs at the Front Desk   a nice welcome touch for little ones Overall a very comfortable stay that met and sometimes exceeded my expectations  
P => Nice Hotel We just returned from a  night stay at Loews  The hotel was very nice the hotel staff goes out of their way to make you happy The bathroom was awesome with the huge bathtub with jets and extra large towels  The room was large and came with complimentary valet and breakfast room service breakfast was wonderful  My only complaint was that there was some construction going on outside of our room and it was very loud and started at am  We called the front desk and they moved us to a quieter room  Other than that it was a great stay  The hotel bar was very fun 
P => Best Hotel  First thing you do is join the Lowes First program   This is the hotel in Montreal we have stayed in several and this is it  Wonderful restaurnats and shopping right outside your door  The staff cares about your stay and are attentive  The rooms are comforatble and bathroom is amazing ble tub w telly Beds are soft and cozy  nice sheets Great little apps and wine in the lobby bar Just a great hotel   It is where we always stay in Montreal  Cant beat it or the price Just cant say enough nice things about this hotel  
P => bon jour Montreal  Great location and great staff   The room was spotless clean   Seemed like they were expecting us   We loved the maple fudge that they served in the afternoon   One block and you will be on St Catherine Avenue   I would definately stay there again   Merci P amp W Doudar  Los Angeles 
P => Well located Great Service and Beautiful Just returned from a  night stay at the Loews Vogue and it was truly a delight Its a boutique hotel located right near first class shopping and restaurants in downtown Montreal  The service was great rooms are beautiful     no complaints whatsoever  The bathroom is very large at least in the Premium rooms with a jacuzzi tub and a small TV among the nicest features  The bed was extremely comfortable The lobby has  computers available for guests to access the internet free of charge  You can also get internet service from your room but there is a per diem charge for that about  I think   Theres a cozy and stylish little bar area where you can have a drink and another area with comfy chairs a sofa and a fireplace where you can read the newspaper etc The only thing to avoid is the hotels restaurant  The food was very mediocre and disappointing in contrast to so many other places in Montreal  Service was only fair even when the restuarant was practically empty  Dont waste your money You are steps away from much better food     even the food courts in the malls are better  
P => Great Value Jetted Tub and friendly staff Wife and I just got back from Montreal and had a great stay at the Loews Vogue Montreal  Being from the west coast I wasnt very familiar with the Loews chain we dont have one in Vancouver or Seattle   as a matter of fact I dont think they even have one in Toronto  Nonetheless this place was a gem  My room was  and included chocolates nightly on the pillows a surprise gift which was an ice wine type local product  The room was a good size the bed was absolutely perfect  We chose a King Size bed and it took all we had to get up in the morning   very very comfortable  The bathroom was the best Ive ever experienced  Alot of square footage a Jetted tub erate shower and heat lamp for additional warmth  They have a DVD rental program and lots of little extras like free shoe polishing Customer service was second to none and location could not be better  One street over from very active Crescent street and a block up for shopping haven Ste Catherines street  Ive staye and more high end hotels than I could count   The Loews is my new favorite  We need a Loews in western canada  
P => First time staying at Loews hotel chain  and will return It was our first visit to Montreal we went end of t   sorry for late review and we usually pick luxury hotels if possible when travelling   to  star  The Loews met our expectations LocationWe found the hotel was difficult to find because of all the one way streets around the hotel  We missed the turn as the hotel is not located on a main street  So make sure you ask for good directions when leaving the airport Service We took the red eye flight at the time it seemed like a good idea at the time  However we forgot that check in was at  pm  So we were forced to tour Old Montreal early  Our room was not ready but the front desk said they would call us once it was  We were able to get our room around  pm   so we were very tired  The hotel lobby is small and your room key is required to access the elevator  The doorman was very helpful with directions and greeted us each time we came and left the hotel  When it rained the doorman provided us with an umbrella for our shopping trips  There were fruits in the lobby for guests hidden the corner ParkingValet parking is the only choice  we found they we had to wait often despite calling ahead of time  I think they were short staffed and the hotel does not have a private drive for the valet cars so you see the staff moving cars alot along the busy Montreal street the hotel is located  If you are thinking about self parking there is none that is within walking distance  One thing about Montreal some of the older areas you will notice very narrow streets  RoomWhen we finally did settle into our room the room was a nice size  Bathroom was nice jacuzzi tub with T V arate walk in shower arate vanitymake up mirror outside of bathroom  Bed was comfortable clean room  no dust  window coverings provide a dark room if you are looking to catch some sleep  Nightly turn down included  LocationAttractions NearbyThe hotel is located directly across from a gentlemans club and the shopping district on St  Catherines Street underground shopping  also has several gentlemans entertainment and shopping an odd mix but you see the bouncer standing outside of these locations  You cant miss the neon signs  But dont worry it is child friendly and we found the crowd was not as loud as downtown Toronto night life  Loved the location it was very close to the underground shopping centre that Montreal is so popular  Shopping was great because we found lots of deals  end of summer sales   We found alot of restaurants within walking distance  However to tour Montreal I would recommend renting a car to see Old Montreal or Latin town  Lots of choices of restaurants if you are willing to drive   mins  
P => Great location super comfortable room We often go to Montreal but have never stayed at the Vogue  We really enjoyed our stay there  The location is great the bed super comfortable and the towels are extremely abundant and plush  The hotel also has a small gym with nice cardio equipment  
P => Best Service in Montreal My wife and I stayed in early    for a good week end shopping trip  The service was excellent The rooms were very good  Nice spacious and quiet The bathroom was very good  Above average size deep jacuzzi tub shower and bathrobes The downstairs restaurant was average Room service was excellent Free internet downstairs in the lobby If traveling by car do yourself a favor and take the package deal for breakfastcontinental and parking  Worth every penny since parking is getting expensive in Montreal including no more free parking on Sundays  
P => Best Hotel My husband amp I stayed in this hotel last weekend and we absolutely loved it  We went there for my birthday and the concierge essentially planned everything for us  He recommeded a wonderful bakery a  minute walk from the hotel a wonderful spa a  minute walk from the hotel and a wonderful romantic restaurant on the same street as the hotel In addition on the actual birthday the hotel surprised us with two wonderful cakes The room was amazing The service was superb Def  cant wait to go back I highly recommend this gem  
P => Amazing Stay I was staying at this hotel on business last week and I must say that it is THE best hotel Ive ever stayed in  More than the gorgeous rooms the great bathroom the fantastic food      the service and staff were second to none  Theyre the best ever in every way  
P => Best part of the trip We had a very rough unlucky weekend of bad travel and bad weather and the only bright spot of the trip was Hotel Vogue From the moment we arrived the service was amazing the rooms were very nice and the concierge was so helpful  We loved staying here and would absolutely recommend it if youre looking for a peaceful getaway and a great hotel If we go to Montreal again there is no question we would stay here  
P => A lovely Christmas at Loews We spent Christmas weekend in this hotel and had a great time  The rooms are well equipped and the sheets are especially luxurious  The bathroom was huge and always well stocked with towels high end soaps and bath products  The staff is very friendly and eager to help  The hotel itself is in a great location  The street is relatively quiet in terms of foot traffic but it is Montreal and if somebodys having a good time a couple of blocks away youre bound to hear it  It is close to the main shopping strip great restaurants and other tourist attractions  We felt safe and looked after in this hotel and though we knew the neighbouring rooms were occupied we never once saw or heard anything We would definitely recommend staying at this hotel again  It has the true Montreal charm that is lacking from the larger hotels  
P => Great Location Room was nice but if you need peace and quiet ask to stay in a room facing away from the main street  The location was only blocks away from shopping and nightlife  The rooms were large and comfortable  I would stay here again    out of  
P =>   Loud construction am to pm   Single pane windows  While we loved the hotel charm friendliness et al  When you get woken up before am with construction noises outside of your window you quickly realize the Most important thing about a hotel is that you get some sleetp A building is being torn down on the rear of the property  Our neighbor says that he heard the noises too  Blinds and curtains dont help much when there are single Pane windows that let the sound in Avoid this hotel until ember  
P => Excellent Hotel We have just had a few days at this lovely hotel  Right from check in the service was extremely efficient and friendly  We consulted the concierge desk several times for restaurants and car hire and they could not have been more helpful  The room was big and pleasant and I particularly liked the fact that there was a properly lit dressing table area in the room   pretty rare in my experience  The bed was very comfortable  There was noise from the street outside on Friday and Saturday nights other nights were ok  The location is great very central and there is a fantastic department store called Ogilvys opposite the hotel  We really enjoyed our stay and would certainly return  
P => What Makes This a Great Place I arrived at Loews in Montreal after a  hour delay at the hub airport from which I departed   getting in close to midnight  When I reached the front desk the hasstles of the day ended  I was checked in quickly and smoothly baggage sweep up by the bell captain shown to my room great corner room in quiet location    and despite the hour was told that no problem at all exited with room service that it operated  hours a day and one could even have breakfast anytime throughout the day  Dinner arrived in less than minutes everything just right and as ordered And so it continued for  days for example when out of tea in the room a supply was delivered by a hall captain when a problem existed with a plug for the lamp an electrician appeared in short order and when some supplies were needed for a professional presentation the concierge provided just what was needed It is the case that the rooms are well furnished and well equipped and that the bathrooms are terrific  A certain range of other hotels have those features too    but few if any provide the service the attentiveness and the superb staffing of Loews Hotel Vogue Montreal  A great place  
P => Excellent Hotel Just spent a romantic weekend at this great hotel  The room was spacious and well furnished  The staff was very attentive and polite  We really enjoyed the lounge and their sausage appetizers  The only complaint is the noise from the street below  As long as you dont go to sleep before  am youll be fine  The jet tub is a great way to start the day  I would suggest this hotel for any getaway  
P => TripAdvisor   on the money again Although Hotel Vogue doesnt maintain the highest hotel star rating there is absolutely no reason it shouldnt The rates were modest for the area the service sublime and the room was fabulous  Please note You must force yourself out of bed  Its that comfortable and peaceful of a nights sleep From the knowledgeable conceirge to the happy go lucky bellmen and doormen we felt as if we were staying in our home away from home  When we departed we were gifted adieu apples and water bottles to ensure our appetites and thirsts would be quenched in our travels home  Book this hotel  Period  
P => Great Unless You Want to Sleep This is a charming upper end property in the heart of the city  The only problem Single paned windows mean you hear everything    I mean everything from the street below  There are lots of bars below  See where Im going Loud loud loud in the rooms We checked out after one day and headed to the Inter Continental a fabulous place  
P => Staff puts this hotel a cut above the rest  Inspired by the overwhelmingly positive reviews I read on the web I booked this hotel for its location and jetted tub  I would reccomend it without hesitation to anyone priily beause our experience with the staff  they were outstanding at every single turn with everything from booking us appointments at a nearby spa to accomodating my boyfriends need to keep his insulin type one diabetic cold at all times  The room service was lightning quick even in the middle of the night and while pricey which was to be expected the portions were quite generous and the quality surpassed my expectation for hotel food  If I was going to nit pick one tiny thing I wished the lighting in the bathroom had a dimmer switch or a different option  the somewhat harsh overhead light took away from the relaxation we so anticipated in the tub  Everything else was outstanding and I look forward to staying there again  
P => loved this hotel stayed at this hotel for  nights the staff couldnt do enough for you and the rooms were wonderful  The location was perfect would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any one  
P => Flawless Just lovely  Exquisite rooms  Clean and excellent  Great location  I felt like a movie star  A pool would have made it perfect 
P => Delightful Hotel This hotel is a gem in the heart of Montreal  Spent a delightful weekend at the Vogue  Close to everything in downtown Montreal  One half a block from Ste Catherine Street shopping the hotel offered an oasis of quiet in the middle of Canadas most dynamic city  Room service breakfast was fabulous  Staff was most helpful  The ble bathrooms were great as were the duvet comforters and feather beds  Would stay at this hotel anytime I visit Montreal  
P => Loved the Hotel Vogue My husband and I visited the Hotel Vogue for a Labor Day weekend getaway  We picked the hotel by using Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed  The hotel was absolutely beautiful  Our room was enormous  It had an entryway a makeup application area with lights and a bench and the largest bathroom I have ever seen at a hotel  The bathroom had a fabulous jacuzzi which we used every night while we were there  Another nice touch was the plants in the room and in the bathroom  There was a flat screen television in the bathroom  While thats certainly not a necessary amenity it did feel extremely luxurious  Housekeeping was wonderful  They even straightened up at night when they came for turn down service  and left classical music on to relax us when we came back to the room  The hotel was extremely well situated right in the heart of downtown Montreal  We could not have been happier with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a little pampering in the center of the city  
P => Top Notch Reviews were right on the money  Had a great stay with my wife  Rooms are spacious quiet amp clean with exceptionally comfortable beds sparkling linens and a stocked mini bar  Bathrooms are luxurious with ble tubs quick filling bath with powerful jets amp a nice mini t v  to boot  One of our days was very rainy amp the comfort of the hotel made it enjoyable  The staff is extremely attentive and really went above amp beyond the call of duty to ensure a nice birthday for my wife  I would never stay anywhere else in Montreal  Thanks again to the Vogue staff for a great stay  
P => Perfect Our  night stay confirmed everything positive youve read up to this point The hotel is beautifulThe rooms are gigantic we were upgraded because it was our wedding anniversary simply by askingThe bedding is wonderfulThe quotelectronicsquot are great    DVDVCR you can hook up your iPod if you bring proper cabling lots of TV stations which is kind of fun if youre from out of the country and enjoy discovering French language TVThe staff is impeccable  Everytime we called for help and we kind of asked for a lot of little things they sounded genuinely eager to help    and did This hotel is the very definition of refined timeless luxury  Would stay again without hesitation  
P => Awesome service and location This hotel is awesome  The service was perfect from the moment i arrived the bellman took my bags and the check in was quick and smooth  During my entire stay there was always a doorman ready to greet me and open the door  Its located a block from the pubs and restaurants of Crescent street and in the center of the city  The old town Montreal is just a  to  min taxi ride away  The room was very large and comfortable the linens were awesome  The bathroom was HUGE with ble everywhere a erate tub and shower stall and a small TV  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  For a more romantic getaway i would recommend the St Sulpice in old town Montreal ive stayed there many times and it is a great hotel  
P => A hop skip and a jump away from rue St  Catherines I love the location its just a hop skip and a jump away from St  Catherines street  I lived in the area for many years so Im familiar with the area  I loved waking up to the trade papers every morning and seeing the Bell Cap dressed in his array  As soon as I approached the Hotel the doors were opened my bags were wisked away and from that moment on the Vogue had me in the palm of its hands  
P => top of the line I have been returning to the Hotel Vogue ever since it opened in  and I can tell you it is still one of the best hotel experiences Ive had anywhere As a hotel owner myself and director of keting I know the business  I can say without hesitation that management here is terrific and that the staff is so so well trained I wanted to steal them all for our hotel They are pleasant informed well groomed clear and just a delight to deal with A request for a room change was handled perfectly No questions asked the room was changed and the guests were happy  This is the way it should always be done Congratulations et tres tres bien fait well done MerciJim BraudeDirector Of ketingHotel Saint Louis Bastille Paris France 
P => The Vogue was fantastic My husband and I stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue from  st until e th  We loved it We stayed in a queen canopy room    it was lovely  Elegantly orated with wonderful linens a luxurious bath ked out in ble and a whirlpool to boot  The hotel itself was very clean and our room was immaculate  Housekeeping was wonderful    so friendly and they did a terrific job  Our room was cleaned each time we went out and restocked with fresh towels and robes  In the evenings as part of the turn down service we were stocked with chocolates and a little card letting us know the next days weather forecast  Our package gave us a daily continental breakfast served as room service  Fresh croissants danishes and muffins were served with excellent jams and malade as well as tea coffee and juice complimented with a vase of fresh flowers  Service by all staff at the hotel was wonderful    from reception to the concierge the bellmen to the parking attendants we were met with smiling faces all eager to help  The concierges were especially helpful suggesting restaurants and jazz clubs that turned out to be top notch  Check in and check out were quick and easy and upon our departure we were handed a little bag for the road containing fresh fruit and bottled waters  A nice touch for a long drive home My husband and I have stayed at many hotels and resorts in various places around the world that have all been highly rated but this one  just be our new favorite Oh and for dog lovers like us this is a dog friendly hotel and has room service for dogs consisting of specially prepared balanced meals and bottled water  For those with children or babies like us they offer different programs to make your stay more enjoyable as well as cribs for the little ones  We cant say enough    the Loews exceeded all of our expectations If anyone has any questions feel free to e mail me at iceliv yahoo com  
P => Great location in Montreal Excellent hotel in an excellent location  Had an issue the first night with not getting a double bed but the receptionist made sure the next night we had the room we wanted Great friendly staff a joy all round would stay here again  
P => Lovely hotel This is a really lovely hotel in a great location  Service is impeccable and the rooms are large and very nicely appointed  Huge jacuzzi bath and arate shower in a very spacious bathroom  Quality towels and bedding just everything I love in a hotel  Very comfortable and not intimidating for a lady travelling on business alone  
P => Exquisite This hotel is fabulous Wonderful attentive service sumptuous rooms with ble baths with whirlpool and TV centrally located  We stayed at this hotel for a week and cant wait to go back  It was like being royalty  
P => Still a winner     I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and liked it very much  Returning this year I was a bit skeptical in that the hotel was a few years older and was concerned about its wear  I was pleasantly surprised in that the rooms are still first rate and have been kept up quite nicely  The location is excellent near all of the Catherine Street shopping  We did have some minor issued at the hotel but after addressing them with the front desk they were remedied  The only downside is that there is no official hotel restaurant and although there is one attached to the hotel it is not owned by them and service can be lacking  
P =>  star for the Loews Vogue hotel My wife and I spent  days at the hotel and just loved everything about the hotel  We were amazed by the size of the room and the bathroom  We were given an upgrade since our room wasnt ready and we had arrived on an early flight quotthanks Sandraquot  The in room dining is a little expensive but arent all hotels similar We were around the corner from the best Street in Canada Crescent St  We found an amazing Italian restaurant Pino s that served awesome meals till am  The concierge at the Loews recommended it and he was right on  We then went and did a little bar hoping at several pubs and this was all within a block of our hotel  If you want to be in the heart of it stay at the Loews 
P => A five star experience for a three star price Im very picky about hotels and generally dont enjoy traveling for work  However my stay at this hotel made a  day conference trip really wonderful  My room was as elegant as a five star hotel in Manhattan  The bathroom had beautiful granite and in a lovely way not in the cheesy way you see in many hotels  It had a deep tub as well as a arate glassed in shower  I never use tubs in hotels but this was more like a spa so I used it twice fun to watch Star Wars with French dubbing at am  Even the artwork on the walls was lovely The room was so quiet and the curtains so thick that I was able to sleep late every day stayed on west coast time successfully  The two elevators were very fast and I never waited more than a few seconds  Even the gym was ent enough to get me in there working out and open  hours My only complaint is they charged day for the internet connection which was very fast  Trying to freeload off the local wireless didnt work  Also all extra amenities and food are very expensive so I recommend eating out I used the metro extensively  Its  short blocks from the hotel  The street one walks on St  Catherine something is quite lively with shops but there are also some relatively tame looking strip joints along that walk and late at night there are transients out and about  The metro stop itself at this particular location Peel is a bit gritty the others I went to were much nicer  So that might be a turn off for some people  I recommend buying a week long pass for  if youll be using it extensively I would definitely stay here again if I visit Montreal again  This was a magical hotel for me  I was so relaxed there and slept so well and should add now that the bed linens were wonderful as was the turndown service which left classical music playing and truly terrific chocolate  And all this for night plus tax 
P => Excellent location My husband and I visited Montreal and stayed at the Loews Hotel for  nights  Upon arrival we were given a twin bedroom as it was the only one left  I was disappointed to say the least however I was assured that we would be given another room the following day  As promised the following morning we were moved to a  poster room  The best part of the hotel is its location   its  seconds walk to the main shopping area    perfect The bedrooms have large bathrooms erate shower cubicle with tvs so you can have a bath and watch tv the bar is rather small but adequate for a prepost dinner drink and the restaurant menu sounded nice but the restaurant itself was pretty much empty on all  nights  There are plenty of nice restaurants to visit in the Old Town and so it wasnt a problem  The staff were all courteous  All in all a good place to stay  
P => Luxury and an Ideal Location This hotel has the atmosphere and individualized service of a boutique hotel but is really not that small  Luxurious but unpretentious beds and bathrooms are outstanding friendly staff remember your name  Really the only drawback to this hotel is that rooms are hot in this cold weather and you cant turn down the heat enough  My favorite Montreal hotel partly because of its location in the heart of the best shoppingnightlife area  
P => Warm cozy luxuriant    Located right in the heart of downtown Montreal this hotels unprepossing facade faces a very busy street and across from the very chi chi Ogilivys department store  However the noisy busy exterior is soon left behind the minute you are welcomed by the accomadating doorman and step into the small warm and cozy lobby interior  To the left upon entry was a cozy bookshelved fireplace and waiting area furnished with oversized chairs sofas and coffee tables displayed with impressive looking hardcover books on art natural history architecture and the like There is a small sunken cocktail bar to the right upon entering the lobby and just beyond that is the hotel restaurant My husband and I have stayed here twice   once in early fallober  and again recently in winter ch    Both times we were thoroughly satisfied and enjoyed what the hotel had to offer in the way of service comfort and anemities A word of caution to summertime and fall guests because this is a downtown hotel and located right in the heart of the bar hopping and nightclub scene ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the front facing rooms pick up a lot of street noise from below  This is not so much a problem during the winter when downtown revellers generally stay indoors and tend to leave their cars at home but in the summer the noise level picks up quite a bit and can interfere with a good nights sleep This was our only complaint and a minor one as the room was perfect and met all my expectations which the hotel front desk staff duly noted I was pleasantly surprised upon our second stay that the hotel remembered our comments and not only welcomed us back as guests and greeted us by name upon check in but remembered to give us a quieter room towards the back of the hotel  It is the small details such as this which give the hotel extra points for service as far as we are concerned  Two thumbs up for remembering their homework hereBoth times we booked through the hotels web site for a premiumdeluxe room Check in was courteous prompt and friendly and secure  You are given a credit card type room key with which you must use on the elevator to access your floor and then your room Now we come to the best part   the rooms The rooms are absolutely  WONDERFUL   Spacious cozy warm and tastefully furnished  Generous closet space with complimentary umbrella even bathrobe in room safe and extra blanket and pillow if needed  The mini bar which we did not use was filled with champagne wine imported beer snacks etc  with wine glasses ice bucket and corkscrew nearby unfortunately there are no ice machines available on any of the floors   you have to call room service to get ice or go downstairs to the hotel lobby cocktail bar The bed was absolutely LUXURIOUS with comfortable not too hard or overly soft king size mattress and bedding which included generous comfy pillows and an opulent luxurious down filled duvet that you could just sink into and lose yourself  But wait it gets better   The bathrooms are this hotels BEST feature and well worth taking advantage of  The huge bleized bathroom features a arate enclosed shower area with the toilet area discretely tucked away from theGENEROUS oversized jacuzzi tub which can comfortably accomadate two people  Theres nothing I love better at a  star hotel than to immerse oneself in a luxurious oversized jacuzzi tub filled to the brim with ones favorite bath essence or oils and reLAAAX    and this hotel fits the bill perfectly Towels are luxuriant   cotton and plentiful  Included anemities are tastefully arranged bathroom sundries such as skin lotions scented soaps shampoos and cloths Nightly turndown service was included in the price which included chocolates on the pillow and the roombeing misted after pillows have been fluffed up and sheets turned down This is a wonderful hotel tasteful clean luxurious friendly and accomadating  I would not hesitate to stay here a third time My only reluctance from giving this hotel an excellent rating is the lack of individual room temperature controls  I found the room overly warm and the air very dry  Since I always like to turn down the temperature at night before going to sleep the lack of this feature made it a little uncomfortable  Other than that it was a near perfect stay For those who like to bar hop there are a plethora of nightclubs bars and cafes to choose from  Shop a holics will enjoy the many boutiques and Ogilivys department store across the streetnearby and for art lovers the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is just up the street  Montreal is also known for its exceptional cuisine in all of North America and you will have no problem finding many excellent restaurants nearby   all within comfortable walking distance of the hotels front doorsAs a final note I would avoid eating in the hotel dining room or even ordering room service as it tends to be overly pricey  Instead I highly recommend taking a stroll over to Crescent street and thereabouts to enjoy the many diverse choices of restaurant cuisine offered  appaloosa 
P => Top notch We spent a weekend at the Vogue in mid uary  Got a very good weekend rate though the regular rack rates seemed a little steep  Our room had an entrance foyer which gave the bedroom privacy when answering the door  The room itself was well equipped and spacious with two Queen beds sporting comfortable mattresses and top quality bedding  There is a safe in the room  The large ble bathroom contained both a shower stall and jacuzzi tub though the little  inch TV perched above it seemed dated and sort of funny  The lobby has a nice spophisticated cocktail bar area and a comfortable lounge with fireplace  There is also a formal looking restaurant with apparent Italian overtones but we did not eat there  Your room entry swipe card also operates the elevators for added security  The neighbourhood is safe and convenient half way between St  Catherine Street and Sherbrooke Street with Ogilvys across the street and the clubs of Crescent street are one block over  Also nearby is the Musee des Beaux Arts Holt Renfrew and the Ritz Carlton  Staff were pleasant obliging and competent and nothing seemed to be too much of a bother  The Vogue is neither a hive of activity nor the soul of mirth but is a very well run well furnished quiet and comfortable hotel in a good location which should suit mature discerning travellers  Recommended  
P => Beautiful Hotel My boyfriend and I and another couple stayed at the Loews Vogue from      Staff location and rooms were great  The bed was so comfortable I could have slept for days  Bathrooms are huge with bath amp shower  Cleaning staff did a great job  Location was excellent for bars restaurants shopping etc  My only complaint is that hotel parking per night is rather expensive  Better off parking at the lot next door  I would definately return to this city and hotel in a heartbeat  
P => Great Hotel  My boyfriend and I stay at Lowes Hotel Vogue during  th thru rd   We both loved the hotel  The staff was great the concierge was even better and the bartenders were friendly and engaging  We had an average size room on the th floor and the room was very quiet and had a large bathroom  The only complaint we both had was the restaurant in the hotel which was not so great  The hotel is not too far from the airport about  minutes and is centrally located to fine shopping museums and restaurants  We went during the winter which is cold and snowing but we both found the snow to be beautiful and it made it feel like Christmas  If you go during the winter make sure to take a good coatThe people are very friendly and if you speak French they will love you but don t be worried if you don t because everyone we met spoke English  The city is also very gay friendly and has a great gay section called the  Latin Quarter   I also suggest you visit Old Montreal Montreal Casino they have a great restaurant there  We loved the city and plan to return in the summer  
P => Great Stay My boyfriend and I had a two night stay in this lovely suite  I would recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway or for an extended weekend  I would recommend parking at the green P parking its right next to the hotel  It was  to park there from Saturday to Monday  We just parked the car when we arrived and walked everywhere it was in a great location where everything was around  I have heard that it is expensive to park at the hotel When traveling to Montreal again I would stay at this hotel again  
P => Exquisite What an exquisite Hotel the Vogue is  The rooms are simply beyond luxurious  The bathrooms something befitting a royal  I went to Montreal to shop and check out the restaurants  I felt guilty every moment out of the room  Excellent location for shopping and restaurants  It was made especially nice after a stay at the Hotel W         a trendy boutique hotel in old Montr al which would be more suitable a film version of the Matrix part I had ordered a non smoking room at the Hotel W  I have chronic sinusitis so often have no sense of smell  I double checked when I got there to be sure the room was non smoking  A non smoking room wasnt available so I had to come back a few hours later  Then dispensing with the front desk banter I went to the room and crashed  Only to die later  There were ashtrays everywhere Solution I checked out and went to the Vogue  No racket no fuss no complaints  I will simply never go back to the W again  
P => What a Room My family and I visited Montreal last ember and ided to choose Hotel Vogue because of all the positive reviews given about it  It was a bit more expensive than the average hotel rate but it was definitely worth it The room was amazing with a beautiful canopy bed and nice vanity  The best part was the large ble bathroom with jacuzzi  It was nice to come home to after walking outside in the snow all day  The service was great  Small issues were that the view was nothing special since it is not a tall building it wasnt in the heart of downtown but relatively close and we didnt receive complimentary bottled water as advertised  I would definitely recommend this hotel 
P => I made an excellent choice    we loved it I took my boyfriend to Montreal for his th birthday  we stayed at this wonderful hotel  the first class service at front desk was great  they provided us with servicing our room  times a day  the concierge agents were very helpful and they made our trip very special  the only thing that I wish it was better it was the lobby of the hotel which was very small  overall the hotel was excellent 
P => Wonderful in every way My fiance and I spent  nights in Montreal staying at the Hotel Vogue  We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel  I was concerned about street noise as that was mentioned in some reviews  Our room while on the second floor and overlooking the street as I think all the rooms do was very very quiet  I can imagine in the summer when theres more street activity late at night noise could be a problem  The weather was chilly so not too many people hanging out late at night  The concierge was outstanding and gave excellent restaurant recommendations as well as directions  The hotel is very comfortable    great bed and pillows lovely bathroom and great valet service with our car  Also we found the location excellent  We walked the city and liked being downtown with clubs the park and restaurants nearby  I highly recommend the Vogue  
P => It doesnt get better than this We stayed at this hotel from  to  after a cruise on Crystal  This hotel was like a continuation of the cruise  We had a wonderful room with stall shower whirlpool bath in tub  phones  large windows and an extremely comfortable bed  The room was very large and beautifully orated  This is a rather small hotel located in downtown Montreal  There are numerous shops and restaurants nearby museums and movies within walkind distance  The subway is  block away as is the entrance to the underground mall  Two restaurants we enjoyed nearby were Eggspectation and Pain Dore both within one or two blocks and only open for breakfast and lunch  There is also a good delicatessen called Reubens about two blocks away on St  Catherine St  After a cruise we do not want fancy food but there were many fine retaurants in the neighborhood too  The concierge was very helpful in giving us directions as well as suggestions as we were looking for particular purchases  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful  The price of the hotel is not cheap but much less expensive than comparable boutique hotels in another big city like New York  We have traveled all over the world and stayed at many great places but I thought this was outstanding    I suggest that if you book here you join Loews Frequent stay club  It is free and entitles you to certain perks like newspapers and a fruit bowl when you arrive  
P => Most wonderful hotel in the world I have stayed at hotels all over the world and I cannot say that I have ever had a better experience than the one I had at the Loews Hotel Vogue  Beautiful rooms first rate service and excellent location  The beds are extremely comfortable and well dressed  The bathrooms are spotless and luxurious    complete with TV set  Certainly one of the finest hotels in the world to compliment this wonderful city  Other people have commented about the noise but it was not an issue for me I live in New York City and as in any city Im sure there is noise here and there but dont let this deter you from staying here It is truly wonderful  
P => Quelles belles chambres The rooms at the Vogue are the nicest in the city  We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite but saw other rooms at the hotel also  Even the most basic room is spacious and all have jacuzzi tubs  Very clean and comfortable  We had no noise problem at all but did ask for a quiet room  Staff was very nice for the most part some wait staff seemed a bit stuffy  Location was very nice close to shopping on St Catherine st and only a couple of blocks to the underground city and metro lines  Overall a very comfortable stay at a beautiful property  
P => spoiled rotten When we arrived at the Vogue we ended up upgrading our room for only  morecdn  What a great ision We ended up in a suite with a living room dining room kitchen huge master bedroom with the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on a ble bathroom with an enormous jacuzzi and television etc etc etc  We were never so spoiled The rest of the hotel was just as fabulous and the staff were efficient courteous and knowledgeable  From the bellman to the concierge to the bartenderOMN to the front desk staff everyone was fabulous  This is what a luxury hotel is all about  Also someone here suggested signing up as a preferred customer on their website  what a great idea It worked very well for us 
P => highly recommend this hotel this past weekend was my th stay at this hotel  at least within the last year and a half I do not feel you can find a better deal in Montreal The location is perfect as is the entire staff  Each time I arrive I am warmly welcomed and greeted by name  It takes me  minutes to finish saying all of my hellos to the staff  That friendliness alone will keep me a loyal guest  The concierges Louis  Felipe and Joh are wonderful and will go out of their way to make your stay memorable from getting a window table at the best St  Laurent st  restaurants to VIP lists at the clubs they can make it happen  On one of my previous stays I asked one of the doormen where i might be able to get a car washed    he did give me directions however it was farther than i wanted to drive  the next morning when i was leaving to drive home my car pulled out up front    washed they had washed it for me in the parking garage I call that service  This past weekend I found a small quotgift bagquot on my armrest some fresh cookies bottled water and some fruit for my ride back to NewYork along with a personally signed thanks you note from the hotel manager  Each time they manage to extend the red carpet further and further Personally i have never had an issue with the noise like others have written about  For anyone looking for a great location this is the place you can find ent rates all the time join the Loews First club and you get lots of nice stuff after a few stays  If anyone travels with their pets    this is a super friendly pet hotel 
P => Nothing less of superb My bf and I stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue for  days last week  I must say this is the best hotel Ive stayed at so far  Our room was very nicely orated with warm colors and a really awesome  poster queen size bed with pillowtop mattress down comforters and comfy pillows  The bathroom is almost as big as the room itself arate whirlpool tub and glass shower  It even has a tv in the bathroom which was a very nice touch  Service was top knotch and location cant be beat  block to your left is St  Catherines where all the shops are  block to your right is Crescent where all the restaurants clubs bars etc  Its really off of the main street so its nice and quiet  Ive had such a positive experience that I will ONLY stay at this hotel when I go back to Montreal I loved it that much and I dont say that often  
P => Noisy but Nice I second the previous rvw  I had a room on the th floor far away from the Club across the street but still heard base thumping until  am The front desk did say that they were replacing all of the front windows quotsoonquot to deal w the noise issue so one might want to inquire about this before staying here The other reviews are pretty accurate in describing the hotel especially about Jacques amp Philip being great concierges  Try to avoid the other guy unless you want a stuffy Frenchman  Also note that it is an old building and that the nice lobby is not representative of this entire hotel Dont forget to eat at Chez LEpecerie while in Montreal  
P => Serious noise problem Light sleeper avoid this hotel I cant see why this hotel is still in buisness if no one can sleep at night  We stayed for buisness  rooms in total and all had trouble sleeping at night during the week  The management seems aware of it but really dont do nothing about it only saying with a fake smile quotwe will assigned you a room facing the back for you next stayquot  Yaright wont give me back my  nights in hell trying to sleep and I will never come back anyway Yes the hotel is really nice and the staff is young and wonderfull and the bathroom are amazing but thats it  I could have sleep in my car and it would be more quiet 
P => I would give it a  if it wasnt so noisy We just came back from  nights at the Hotel Vogue in Montreal  Chose this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and requested a quiet room away from the noise  We ended up on the th floor and were pleased with everything except the not so quiet music from the rooftop of the Hotel De La Montagne up the street  The music was extremely loud and didnt stop till  or  in the morning  After walking around town the entire day it would have been nice to be able to get a good nights sleep  I mentioned it to the front desk during check out and they said that they are planning to install new windows in the hotel to block out the noise The only other issue was the time we returned to our room to discover that housekeeping neglected to shut the door luckily nothing was missing  Aside from the above the Hotel Vogue was very nice  Our premium room was spacious the bathroom was huge and very clean  We loved the jacuzzi tub and the TV in the bathroom  The rooms could have been a little sunnier but I guess you cant expect that from a city hotel  The staff was friendly and helpful  Our flight was cancelled from NY the night before due to weather and management did not charge us for the late cancellation  We were celebrating a special occasion and they sent us a surprise cake  Very nice touch The flowers that my husband ordered were also very beautiful  The location is good for a first time visit since it is central to everything  If you are a shopaholic this is a great location  
P => Nice hotel in the downtown area We stayed in a th floor room overlooking the street  It was very noisy on Saturday night  Which included a drunken medley of Bon Jovi songs sung by a pack of twenty something girls  I can only wonder if they were also wearing acid washed jeans  Sunday through Wednesday it was relatively quite except for an occasional siren  The beds were comfortable and we slept quite well  My wife commented that the room seemed damp but the town was in a middle of a heat wave with very high humidity  The room was directly across from the elevators but we never heard them  Overall the hotel and staff were very accommodating  The location is not very convenient if you are interested in exploring Vieux Montreal  
P => Nice hotel during the day  but impossible to sleep at night The hotel Vogue is really nice large rooms superb bathroom almost larger than the room itslef TV in the bathroom arate shower jacuzzi bath       Very good location  close to everything that Montreal as to offer  BUT the noise at night is terrible  I think the windows are made of plastic  I was on the th floor facing the street and I could clearely hear everything from young drunk kids talking and screaming all night long to police or ambulance cars to trafic jam at am am And the hotel across the street has a club on the roof so live music until h am grrrrr And also I heard all night long the elevators going up and down by the ventilation system like if a train was passing by  I was moved to another room in the morning facing the back but that was not more quiet as other reviews said here    I was facing the back alley of the hotel on the th floor and garbage trucks was passing by making so much noise with picking up trash from other buildings around the hotel parking or another parking entrance was right above the hotel building everytime a car was coming out or in they had to blow the horn  I think I had   hours of sleeping in  nights I understand its not a resort in the middle of no where but I would think that in   an hotel like the vogue would have soundproof windowsSo if you plan not to sleep in beautifull Montreal stay at the Vogue I would love to return its a really good hotel with very friendly and professional staff but why going in a hotel if we canot sleep 
P => Just Wonderful We stayed at the Vogue y  thru  and we loved it  It was very clean and the rooms were spacious    loved the bathroom with the whirlpool tub and modern shower stall  Hubby was impressed with the TV in the bathroom complete with remote control The staff was knowledgeable and friendly  Maid service was perfect including turn down service with chocolates at night  We made our reservation thru Hotwire and I became a member of Loews First club by signing up online before our stay  When we checked in they upgraded us to a deluxe room gave us our preferred amenities fruit amp water and we got the USA today in the morning  We shouldnt have gotten those perks with a Hotwire reservation but they gave it to us anyway The lobby bar was the perfect place to relax after a day of sightseeing  The windows look out on the street and you can watch the people go by  It was very warm in Montreal while we were there and we really appreciated the air conditioning in the hotel The concierge recommended the Europa and the Taj restaurants both of which were excellent  Europa is right down the street and the food and service were incredible  We did the tasting menu with the wine pairings  It was even better than the Inn at Little Washington in our area  The Taj was an Indian restaurant that was top notch and they had a tasting type menu called quotthe feastquot  Of course no visit to Montreal is complete without eating breakfast at quotEggspectationsquot    its right up the street from the Vogue I definitely recommend the Vogue but agree with other reviewers that its best to request a room away from the main street  Our room faced the parking lot and it was very quiet  
P => Lived Up to High Expectations Based on the many strong reviews on Trip Advisor I selected the Vogue for my first visit to Montreal  So glad I did because this is an exceptional property  As others have noted rooms are sizeable lovely and clean and the bathrooms are incredible Staff very polished and professional but also warm and friendly  The Vogue manages to pull off that difficult combination of sophistication and warmth so a guest can enjoy elegant surroundings without being subjected to stuffy attitudes I actually stayed in two different rooms because there was a problem with the shower in the first room I occupied  On discovering the problem I was quickly and cheerfully moved to another room that was equally nice and in fact a bit larger As urban hotels go the Vogue is pretty quiet  However if you are a light sleeper ask for a room in the back of the hotel  My first room was in the back and I never spent a more quiet evening in a city hotel  When I moved it was to a room in the front and I did notice some increase in street noise especially on Friday night when late night revelers were disbursing from the clubs on nearby Crescent Street The location of the hotel is perfect  Close to great shopping several museums many excellent restaurants and a metro stop nearby  The three day combo pass for museumsmetro is a great value at  CA and you can purchase it at many locations  Two wonderful restaurants within a short walk of the Vogue are Europeaand L Autre Season  I had memorable meals at both places  Outstanding advice on restaurants and other questions was provided by a very personable concierge Louis Phillipe If you are headed to Montreal give the Vogue a try Im now among the numerous fans of this very lovely hotel  
P => Great location nice hotel   but noisy This is a very nice hotel in an excellent location     just make sure to ask for a room that does NOT face the street particularly if you are on a low floor  Montreal nightlife is very active and the street that the hotel faces is an active thoroughfare for two way traffic and pedestrians  Since the hotel is surrounded by restaurantsclubs    there is a steady flow of people and honking horns all night long  Do yourself a favor ask for a room that doesnt face the street front of the hotel Other than that the hotel was lovely the people were nice and the location was excellent  
P => The Absolute Best    What do you say about a top notch first class hotel in the best area of Montreal Our room was an executive suite which I happen to snag at  pn Canadian and was magnificent will a full dining area and a whirlpool tub and  bathrooms  my husband naturally got the smaller one TVs everywhere including my bathroom  turn down service with chocolates  who wouldnt love this The head concierage Joh was an absolute delight extremely knowledable and helpful as was every one else  Loved the surrounding area with Ogilvys Dept  Store across the street  kind of like a Neiman cus with superior merchandise  great walking area and you wont be sorry staying here and will thank me endlessly if you take this recommendation  enjoy   I will be a returning customer     
P => Fantastic Stay We stayed at the Vogue for  nights at the end of e and had a wonderful time  The service was exceptional   we called for ice and a pair of scissors and had both items within  minutes  The hotel staff was extremely pleasant and genuinely nice to our two dogs who were treated as honored guests greeted by name by the doormen  We only saw one other dog there a standard poodle I would have liked to have wifi internet access available in our room but there was free internet in the business center off the lobby  The room itself was comfortable and spotless even with two doggies in residence  We walked the city endlessly and were very sore at the end of the day   so the jetted bath with attached tv were a nice way to relax at the end of the day  Location was great within walking distance to everywhere including the Vieux Port although that was a pretty substantial hike about   minutes  Part of the route we took was in the Underground City which was pretty fun to navigate Only gripes were about Montreal itself hideously expensive  for a four pack of Smirnoff Ice at the local liquor store aggressive beggars one woman assaulted us with a drunken request for money while we were eating in an outdoor cafe crowded even on a weekday  Made me happy to cross the bridge back to NY I would definitely stay at another Loews hotel again  Was very impressed by the level of service and quality of the hotel  
P => Highly Recommend the Vogue I am a native Montrealer who has friends stay at the Vogue twice yearly usually for   daystrip  They can afford to stay anywhere in the city but choose the Vogue because of the exceptional service and prime location  Hey right across the street from Ogilvys who would not be happy Since they recently had a baby the hotel was only too happy to provide a crib amp basinette  I also believe small pets are welcome  And be sure to check out Francines wicked tinis in the bar   they rock  Theres something to be said when the concierge amp doormen all greet you by name amp you dont even stay there  Or they wave when you drive by because they recognize you or your car  And on a professional note my firm holds many corporate events amp the Vogue is one of our preferred venues for meetings amp accommodating out of town guests  The Vogue  not be the most stylish or trendy hotel in Montreal but Id be hard pressed to find a better located hotel  On de La Montagne Mountain Street one block south amp one block north of the hotel there is a restaurant every  steps amp so many of them are worth checking out Rosalie Da Vinci Katsura to name a few one block West is Crescent bars galore also fine restaurants shopping across the street at Ogilvy if you like designer names amp in prime shopping territory on Ste Catherine street for shoes leathersuede denim amp so much more  Also a hop skip amp jump away from the Peel or Guy metro stations allowing access to the underground shopping that links the major department stores For me the Vogue is   
P => A native Montreal chimes in Stayed at Loews Hotel Vogue for three nights in il  I am a native Montrealer who has been living in the US for  years  I travel frequently to Montreal to visit family and friends  Although I have stayed in many of the five star properties in Montreal such as the Ritz Carlton Sofitel Omni and Hotel Le Germain I have always preferred the Vogue  Why It s small well located has spacious rooms with comfortable beds and large bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs  Prices are also usually reasonable check internet for deals and also check for the AAA rates  Since I also enjoy taking a bath each evening I like the fact that each bathroom has its own TV  Service is probably the one thing that is not consistent  Room service is quick and when you order toasted bread it arrives warm instead of cold and hard  Defintiely treat yourself to as many Montreal bagels as you can they re the best and have a unique flavor  Be advised that the hotel scene in Montreal is in transition at this point  Ten years ago there were only a handful of five star hotels  Now there are a bunch of boutique style hotels that opened in Old Montreal as well as on the Eastern border of central downtown e g  Hotel Godin Hotel Gault W Hotel St  James Hotel St  Paul  The problem for me with those hotels is their location  Although they are located in nice areas of Montreal they are not centrally located to the central area of downtown where most of the shopping is  On the other hand nothing beats Old Montreal in the summer  Words of warning Ritz Carlton has beautiful public spaces but rooms are not up to Ritz standards  The Omni used to be a Four Seasons and the rooms still have the same scratched and tattered furnishings form when Four Seasons gave it up back in the  s  Rooms were also not well cleaned  Le Germain is a great property and I highly recommend it  The only thing is that their prices usually run about  more a night then the Vogue  Enjoy this beautiful city 
P => Perfect location and place Stayed at the Loews in ch after a busy business trip I wanted to have a nice place to rest and to visit some friends living in Montreal  Location is great no need to have a car  My room was quite spacious and most important clean and quiet  Staff was helpful polite and friendly  The internet free connection at the lobby is very good to check email time to time The bar is small but warm if you are looking for a busy bar with people to talk to    Just forget it  The food at the restaurant is nice but not exceptional there is a menu for lunch and one for diner My only negative point is about a wrong surcharge of a small amount of CAN they got this small amount of money from my credit card after my check out  The so called charge was a drink took at the bar    How strange    At the same hour I was in my plane    I was quite surprise but I didnt complained it if I call them or send a letter it will probably cost the same amount of money after a while Except this mistake my stay was very comfortable and pleasant  
P => Hotel Vogue just gets BETTER and BETTER I travel frequently to Montreal on business and am not the type of person to stay at only one hotel  Well its getting hard NOT to pick Hotel Vogue and ONLY Hotel Vogue for Montreal stays Its an elegant hotel without being snooty about it  The emphasis is on comfort and privacy There really are no downsides to the hotel though I admit I have never parked my car here I usally fly in and take taxis around the city  So I cant attest one way or the other to the state on on site parking The gym is good the small bar is nice though it gets smoky quite quickly the food is good and the service   well the service is what you would expect from a Loews Hotel Prices fluctuate here seemingly dependent upon season and the hotels cice  Check the Loews website frequently  Usually Ill end up booking somewhere else then fining a nice deal here the week of my arrival So this place is a cant miss  Its not among my favourite hotels in the world but it is to me among the tope here in my native Canada  
P => Great Stay at the Loews I stayed at the Loews Montreal after a week skiing at Mont Tremblant  It was myself and  children  I had a one bedroom suite which had a bedroom with a king bed and a connected living room with a queen sofa bed and a huge dining room table  The master bath had a beautiful ble jacuzzi tub for two and a TV but no shower  The bathroom that was in the living room had a shower only  The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in  Great linens and comforter  The kids were very comfortable on the sofa bed and we got a roll a way for the third  It was like a regular bed not some cheap fold up job  The location is great as the other reviews state  The staff could not have been nicer  They sent up cards for a free movie or video game rental for each of the kids and there was a bottle of Canadian ice wine in an ice bucket waiting for me  The concierge was very helpful with directions and recommending kid friendly place to eat  When we were leaving and the valet brought up my car there was a bag with  bottles of water and  apples  A nice touch I thought I have stayed in high end hotels and resorts all over the world  I would say that the room was as nice as anyplace I have stayed and the staff and the extras made this one of the most enjoyable places I have ever stayed I would highly recommend this hotel and I will definately stay there again  
P => Luxurious Room  If youre looking for a great place to stay in the heart of Montreal THIS IS IT It is centrally located on the intersection of St Catherines and Montagne flooded with restaurants bars clubs stri clubs stores and boutiques ranging from desginer names to dollar stores  If youre seeking the Night Life the street parallel Cresent to the hotel are lined up with bars and clubs that off er extensive happy hour Check In We arrived at the hotel and the Valet Service took our car  We were able to check in  hours early with no extra charge  B e aware that parking costs night without tip and tax  There were no lines in the lobby area and the concierge was extremely friendly  The security is a bit strict though  To ride the elevator you have to use your room key and you can only access the floor in which your room is on  You also need the room key to acccess different hallways to get to your room Room The room was beautiful  Big enough for  people  The closet was huge and the lighted vanity mirror was an excellent touch  I couldnt stay out of the jetted tub for two especially when there was a tv in the bathroom  The bed has very soft and luxurious linens I felt like i was sleeping on clouds  Unlike other reviews I have read there were no loud noises heard from outside  The street was very quiet  be it is because Spring Break was over  The lounge Very NICe but expensive  The bartender was very friendly  We got free biscuits and cheese with our tinis that cost   for two apple tinis Overall the hotel was extremely nice for the rice we paid about  US through expedia but the extra services did cost a lot more 
P => Best Ive found so far    I stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue at the end of ruary  and found the hotel to be best so far  Ive stayed at the Hotel Nelligan and Hotel St  Paul and found everything about the Vogue to be better  I had a ior suite which had two full bathrooms and room was spacious  The beds here are great  Room service arrived in less than  minutes  There can be a problem with street noise from the club crowd but since it was winter that really wasnt that noisy  I was never awaken from it  Resturant food was very good but a little pricey but for the downtown location thats to be expected  If you like the Loews look into their Loews Reward program  
P => Fun week end at the Vogue Stayed Saturday night  last week end of ruary  Got a suite for a romantic night in Montreal service was very friendly bathroom is much bigger then the norm arate shower  tub amp TV Great lobby fun small bar  Had bottled water amp apples in our car for the ride back home  Very pleasant time at the Vogue  
P => friendly beautiful romantic i can honestly not find a single thing to complain about  the lobby is too small not grandiose enough thats about it and that absolutely doesnt matter  everything went perfectly  the location is great right between maisonneuve and st  catharines  the front desk staff were extremely friendly and accommodating the room was absolutely gorgeous  beautiful bed we didnt have a canopy but next time id love to with the softest down comforter and great pillows  the bathroom was lovely with the jacuzzi tub big enough for two people but not exactly comfortable for two because of the faucet and arate shower i paid  CAD a night which included valet parking and breakfast for  which we had delivered via room service  i thought it was pretty reasonable considering i made the reservation  nights before the stay on the hotel site and not on a discount site the staff were all incredibly friendly and professional from the valet parker to the guy that brought us ice  if you consider what youd pay to stay at the sheraton or the delta i think this is a much better value for your money  probably an average of  more but well worth it  
P => Awesome bed Great Hospitality Just stayed here this past weekend  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  I would stay here again or at any other loewes hotel  The hotel vogue is charming and in a great location  The staff is all about great service  The concierge was most helpful Mr  Louis Phillipe Talbot made reservations for us at a fabulous restaurant gave us driving directions and tips about the city and recommendations for the nightlife  Everyone that works here is friendly and hospitable but best of all was the bed  we stayed in a room with a queen canopy bed  This is one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in as well the duvet and linens were awesome  I cant say enough good things about this hotel  AOh while we were there we did look at a couple of the hotels that were options for us hotel st  james xixe sielce and the place darms and i am glad that we chose the loewes i felt that we got what we paid for and more  
P => Our Favorite Montreal Get away We just spent a wonderful weekend at Loews Hotel Vogue  The room was lovely and the staff friendly professional and very helpful  Service really counts in this hotel The location is great too    easy walking distance to shopping and restaurants  
P => Would stay again in a heartbeat Just returned from a  night stay at the Loews Hotel Vogue  I was visiting Montreal for medical reasons and was therefore not able to do much sightseeing but appreciated the central location of the hotel  The spacious non smoking room on the th floor provided a great environment for convalescing  Comfortable bed beautiful linens  The bathroom was gigantic and about x bigger than the one in a Quebec City hotel I stayed at later in the week  Lighted makeup mirror jacuzzi TV near tub arate shower   room done in ble I got a rate of   CA by booking the room on the hotels web site and Im looking forward to staying here again for my follow up visits  The staff was wonderful  
P => Expensive     but worth every penny I can only say this   WOW  This hotel blew me away and I am VERY picky  I can find absolutely nothing wrong with this place  Its top notch all around  I will certainly say the room is the most beautiful Ive stayed in   and the TV in the bathroom was such a unique touch Just LOVED this hotel  No wonder its the hotel of choice for visiting celebs like Brad Pitt One downside   parking  Its valet parking ONLY and it runs you  a day plus a tip everytime you have someoen fetch your car  You can find lots in the area at about  a day  Its a real drag   but not unusual for a downtown hotel  
P => Lovely hotel in a beautiful city This is in a perfect location in central Montreal a lot of other hotels are nearby too though  I had an executive suite  Two entrances a kitchenette area dining room area living room two desk workstations two bathrooms one with a shower one with a jacuzzi and small color TV two closets a vanity area and the bedroom  The bed was superb  I had three courses of room service which was very good although my main dish a pizza was a bit oily dessert was great  The workout room was better than average several machines all of which work   which seems to never be the case at hotels     Staff was very friendly  My only complaint is that I didnt have a view   I look out the back of the hotel at an alley and backs of other buildings Other reviews mentioned that it was noisy  I was woken up at am by some drunks yelling in French  But this is a city noise happens in cities and Im fine with it   was not a big deal to me The only thing I would consider knocking down the rating for would be the view but I have stayed in several hotels in Montreal and none of them have had views except for the Hilton   and the Hilton was just gross in the room   Id rather have no view and luxury  
P => Very comfortable I got a great rate of   Canadian US  through Destina for one night  The room was large with a fourposter beda dressing area and a big cosy bathroom with jacuzzi and erate shower stall  Free newspaper and bedside chocolates are included too  Hotel is classy and ideally situated in the middle of everything  I had breakfast in the lovely dining room and it was reasonable at   Canadian including tax and tip for an excellent full American breakfast with unlimited delicious cups of coffee  Staff are charming and very professional to top off what was for me a perfect stay  Value and quality cannot be beat  
P => Nice stay I had a nice stay at the Vogue  The room was very large   about  sq  ft  and well orated  The bathroom was about   larger than most hotel bathrooms for this class  foot high ceilings in the room The only minor points I would note are that the carpet had a couple of stains near the minibar and was getting a bit worn the mattress was not pillow topwhich I prefer and most rooms do not have much of a view  On Staturday nights you can hear cars outside from the front rooms until quite late  Would stay here again  
P => Very Very Classy Hotel Vogue is a very classy hotel  We are Loews Gold Members so we got a great upgrade without a request  The room was HUGE dining room kitchen  bathrooms  entrances Very comfortable bed  Employees are friendly and the location is perfect  This hotel has true class It is not a hotel that tries too hard to be a nice hotel like some others with gaudy or  etc Very Nice 
P => Not what I expected       I was recommmended to your hotel by some well traveled friends  They stayed there about seven years ago  I admit the location is is good but I felt that the hotel was tired  I feel that the rooms need to be updated with new carpet and a fresh coat of paint  The hotel has great potential but it needs to be updated  Not what I expected    
P => Perfect for First timers to Montreal Let me start by saying that the Loews Vogue was a great location not only for first timers  but return trips to Montreal  as well  Its perfectly located  easy access to the many areas of Montreal that one would want to explore  The hotel rooms are fabulous very luxurious and comfortable  The bathroom alone is a reason to stay  Huge double person ble tub with tv and arate stall shower  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The only criticism i would say is be sure to do your homework ahead of time of places you want to eat because i found the concierge to be very general in their recommendations and i didnt get the impression that they had actually experienced many of the places themselves  It almost felt like they were reading from the same descriptions that i was in the travel guides  If you are looking for hip and higher end restaurants there are many in the Old Montreal areathe Saint Laurent blvd section is considered the quothipquot and trendy section though we found it to be more quotfake hipquot and the actually good restaurants are in Old Montreal  There is a fabulous vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown called Pho Bang New York   Its a great city and staying at the Loews Vogue will make going back to your room after a day of sightseeing  something to look forward to  
P => They made a resevation mistake    I have stayed at both the Ritz Carlton and Hotel St  Paul in Montreal and the Lowes beats them both  A group of us  guys  rooms went up for a long weekend in   Upon arriving they had us down for single king rooms instead of doubles even thought I had called to confirm  times including that day  However the from desk staff was VERY nice and checked into the correct rooms with in  minutes  The hotel is amzing the lobby is nothing to look at but the rooms and location make up for it  Upon entering the room I could not believe it nicely orated HUGE bathrooms with a TV next to the whirlpool tub The bedding was also the softest and most comfortable Ive ever slept in I always stay at   star hotels  The location could not have been better one block from both St Catherine amp Cresent streets  The hotel also seems to be very pet friendly dog treats in our minibar I have never written about a hotel on any of these sites I was so pleased with my experience here that I had to take the time to write this review  I stayed in a quotstandardquot room and paid  USnight  
P => Best in Montreal I wouldnt call it a Boutique hotel   its too classic  But its a really great hotel Huge bedroom and bathroom nicely orated  The service is also great quotthe invisible housekeepersquot  The location its perfect as well  Dont look any further   this is the place to stay in Montreal  And its not that expensive   so its a good chance to experience a very nice hotel for a fair price  
P => Perfect except     Stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue il  th with my boyfriend for a romatic getaway weekend and it was a great experience  As other reviewers have written the rooms are well appointed the bedding is wonderful and the bathroom huge  We asked for a quite room and it was though the view of the parking lot left something to be desired   which would be my only quotquasi complaintquot  The people at the front desk were polite helpful and friendly  The location was excellent make sure you go to Coras for breakfast a couple of streets over  We ended up going to dinner one night at quotRistorante Bisquot just down the street at  rue de la Montagne on recommendation of the Concierge  The dinning experience ruined our weekend  By accident the waiter spilt red wine all over my boyfriends clothes including a sweater he had just purchased in England  The waiter was very apologetic but the managerowner was extremenely rude to us when we suggested that the dinner be on the house to cover the damages of the ruined clothing which would have been less than paying for a new sweater  There is NEVER an appropriate occassion to verbally abuse a customer  We are still in the process of sorting out with the restuarant payment for the ruined sweater as the stains did not come out even after dry cleaning  Even if they do pay the manner in which we were treated was inexcusable and unacceptable  I ended up in tears that night when I should have been having a romantic evening  So if you are planning to stay in Montreal I highly recommend the Hotel Vogue but stay clear away from Ristorante Bis  
P => Nice but noisy The hotel and the room are beautiful but the bar crowd on the street outside on the weekends can be rather noisy  
P => A gem The Vogue is one of my favourite hotels in Montreal  The location is ideal  The bathrooms are fabulously luxurious Weve stayed there twice and the staff was always very helpful  The atmosphere is very relaxed  Room service is very good  The rooms are a very good size  The beds and bedding are amazing  My boyfriend found the pillow too hard but apparently you can order softer ones  We also had a humidifier brought up to our room and needle and thread  The first time we went we paid CDN  per night and the second time was even less because we paid in advance  You cant get a better deal in Montreal for the quality
