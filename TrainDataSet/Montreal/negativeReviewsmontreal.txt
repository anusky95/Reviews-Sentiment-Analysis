N => Reservation Given Away Do yourself a big favor by calling the hotel if you are arriving late  If you don t they will give it away then blaming on the online booking system  It happens to us even with credit card deposit guaranteed  It ruined our trip to Montreal totally  
N => Exceeded Expectations We have just returned from spending four nights at the Auberge du Vieux Port and had a FANTASTIC timeWe checked in on tember  until tember   The main part of the hotel is located RIGHT on Rue de la Commune which is directly on the riverfront where romantic horse drawn carriages stroll by all day  Across the street is the wharf where the bateaux mouche dock and the bike path begins  Around the corner is the Jacques Cartier Square        This is where we checked in but we knew in advance that we would be staying in one of their off site Lofts However from the moment of our check in we knew we were in for an excellent experienceFredrique escorted us and carried our luggage to our loft around the corner on Rue de Vincent which is an EXCELLENT location Our loft is in a  year old building  The lofts are all BEAUTIFULLY amp rustically reated warehouses        open ceilings exposed brick water pipes etc       Next door is a fantastic Italian restaurant Gallianos where we had TWO delicious dinners Although our loft      HIGHLY RECOMMENDED was up SIX flights of stairs with NO elevator we would not want to ever stay anywhere else  is over  square feet  Please see our scans to get a complete idea of how extraordinary was this loftThe side of the room overlooking Rue de Vincent had four floor to ceiling double windows  Most of the walls are exposed stone and used brick  There is a WORKING fireplace WITH wood provided Although we did not need it the loft is air conditioned and the heating works great  We didnt have time to prepare meals but the kitchenette is well equipped for our needs        microwave        frig      everything      There are two dining tables    formal amp informal  The furnishings are soooo comfortable and welcoming  Take a look at that fantastic BED Wireless CD player TV closet space bath    all great  Comfortable couch and easy chairs      Desk        excellent lighting       The king size bed and linens are LUXIOURIOUS We had daily maid service       bath linens are great At night the view from our loft was breathtaking While sitting on the couch we could see the beautifully lit dome of the che Bonsecours down the street        Below us Rue de Vincent bustled but was very quiet        we never were bothered by noise during our entire stay  Right next door to our loft is a washing machine amp dryer but we did not need to use it EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTWe only paid   a nightBecause we were not staying in the main Hotel we were not entitled to a free breakfast       but it only cost us   and it was GREAT Also Loft Guests had extended breakfast privileges until   Because we are late sleepers this worked out perfectly As explained by previous reviewers breakfast is served in a cozy restaurant below the Hotel Desk  Service was always excellent  We never felt rushed food was always complete and plentiful and our servers were always friendly professional and delightful  Our selections included omelets eggs waffles pancakes assorted breads amp croissants cereals muffins fruits etc    The Hotel Staff at Auberge du Vieux Port was always extremely friendly and helpful LOCATION LOCATION LOCATIONWe didnt rent a car and didnt need one      so much was within walking distance and our four days were not nearly enough time to scratch the surface One morning we took a tour on the Bateau Mouche      relaxing and wonderful      Another morning we rented bikes at Ca Roule         biked to the che where we bought picnic sandwiches cheeses etc amp drinks         and then biked along the Lachine Canal to the Parc where we ate our picnic lunch on the banks of the St Lawrence River and then we biked back Thirty Miles we were told  but it was soooooooooooooo worth it we are  amp  years old and it was a not too miss experience I was tht by the Sisters of the Congregation de Notre Dame de Montreal in New York so I really enjoyed the Bourgeoys Museum and the Bonsecours Chapel  Even my husband an Episcopalian was impressed       One night we bought tickets for a light show at the Notre Dame Basilica  It was called quotLumiere Futquot and was a little cheesy in spots but overall a FANTASTIC show The Basilica where Celine Dion was ried is gorgeous during the day but SPECTACULAR at night Dont miss the Pointe a Calliere Museum Museum of Archaeology and History    VERY well done  Montreal is very proud of its extremely important history and the Pointe offers a great introduction and over view to it Although very French Old Montreal is completely bilingual and everyone we met was extremely friendly and fun  We live in San Diego but we BOTH want to return to Vieux Montreal       it was an unforgettable trip          
N => Absolutely Delightful A charming old world boutique hotel the Auberge du Vieux Port is ideally located with a view of the St  Lawrence River  My husband and I spent five nights in a Deluxe King room which was beautifully orated  The artwork in the bedroom corridor and also the bathroom was tasteful and unique  We particularly liked the hardwood floors exposed beams and stone wall in the room  Robes slippers and an umbrella were included  The staff was especially accommodating and friendly  Michael an exceptional and very pleasant concierge suggested restaurants as well as sights and always asked our opinion of the places we visited  He really went out of his way to be helpful concerned and considerate  Because we arrived in tember we didn t get to have the rooftop breakfast a service that ends ust  however the breakfast in the lower level restaurant was very nice  A nightly wine and cheese cocktail hour between  and  PM was included in the price a very nice touch  They even had live music I reserved the room by phone because I wanted to check on parking  I discovered that it would have been better to make the reservation online  Apparently the person I spoke to failed to include my request for a arate shower  However this issue was resolved quickly and to our satisfaction  We had a lovely room  Although the following problem didn t affect my rave reviews of the hotel I must mention it  I was told that my car would be in an underground garage  I didn t use my car during our stay  When we were ready to leave we were originally told by Daniel that it would take ten minutes to get the car  A half hour later as we waited in the lobby with our luggage Daniel who had been mostly amiable during our stay suddenly became annoyed and instead of apologizing for the delay he was rather curt when we asked how much longer we d have to wait  When my car was retrieved I discovered it was parked not in an underground garage but outside in a tiny lot  We were eager to get on the road so I didn t question this  I do suggest that anyone wishing to park at the hotel find out exactly where they put cars  In conclusion our overall experience was very positive and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a delightful place to spend time in Old Montreal  
N => Dishonest Unfortunately we never actually had the chance to stay at this hotel    Why you ask Well we received a  gift certificate to the hotel as a wedding present  When we finally found a weekend in which to use it just over   years later and after them granting us one quotextensionquot    we discovered the hotel would no longer accept it  They simply had a policy that certificates expire after  year   years if you beg To think the hotel actually took  as payment for a service and then placed an arbitrary deadline on redeeming this Terrible I wouldnt do business with such a business ever again 
N => nice loft We had a loft at Vieux Port  The lofts seem to be housed in buildings arate from the hotel  The loft was very spacious with kitchen washerdryer living area two tvs etc  Be aware that you  have to walk up several flights of stairs for the lofts  Their employee Christian was very helpful  We did have a problem with the Internet in the loft there was no wireless and we were given an ethernet cord so short  in  long that we could not even put our computer on the desk nearest the internet port  Good location in old Montreal  
N => Just wonderful Stayed at Auberge du Vieux Port a month ago  Had a really great tme  Was actually surprised to see it ranked so low on tripadvisor  Staff was just wonderful our stay wouldnt have been same without them  Would go back any time and recommend it to anyone with no doubt  Ask for river front room  
N => Loved this hotel We stayed  nights at Auberge du Vieux Port in y  and it was wonderful  Our room was very large and the bathroom was huge  The staff was very helpful  I will definietly stay here again Just two small issues  our room was right next to the stairs that lead up to the terrace  The noise level was excessive at times  Also I would have liked the bathroom lighting to be a little brighter  
N => Wish We Spent Honeymoon Somewhere Else My new husband and I had high expectations about the Auberge du Vieux Port when we arrived  We had seen pictures on the website   but were so disappointed with our stay there  This was our first stay on our honeymoon     nights at Auberge before heading onto Quebec  It was unseasonably warm during our stay in Montreal and our room was located on the top floor  During the middle of the night a rainstorm came through and the ceiling broke and water ended up dripping onto our bed  We had to physically move the bed to make sure there was not going to be water damage  The air conditioning did little to improve the situation    it was stifling in our room  We must admit    we had a wonderful service during out stay   with many apologies from the conceirge  They waved our parking fee    but that was about it  I would not recommend staying here  
N => Great service terrible food We have just returned from a week end in old Montreal  We had reserved a room at the Auberge and paid extra for a river view  A view in my mind would mean that you would have a clear view of the river but unless you were on the fourth or fifth floor this was not the case  The hotel is at a great location    close to shops and pubs and the service was phenomenal but do not get the package that includes a four course meal  First of all you do not get to choose the four courses and the majority of the meal was inedible  The ceviche was more like sashimi the lobster ravioli was terrible and the fois gras was fois gras  The only thing that saved the meal was the filet mignon    it was delicious  But I could have saved money and eaten a better meal elsewhere  
N => Breakfast pantomine  Following a very nice stay last year my wife and I revisited again for  days with friends in early tember The hotel was as enjoyable as last year apart from the debacle trying to get breakfast  The previous system of helping yourself to cereal fruit juices tea and coffee prior to ordering a cooked breakfast had changed to a full service from the staff What developed was a farce as it took at least  minutes to have your order taken and then a full  minutes for it to be served by the  harassed waiters obviously inexperienced who proceeded to deliver food piecemeal to the wrong tables Each morning we witnessed complaints including ours being made to the staff but despite this there appeared to be no management control over the situation  As a  star hotel for this problem not to be addressed was inexcusable Otherwise the service comfort and cleanliness of the rooms were of a high standard Would I return Yes but I would pre checkout the local diners just in case the breakfast pantomine had not been solved  
N => I would recommend this quaint hotel The Auberge du Vieux Port was a great place to stay  We would stay there again Their strong point was the friendliness of the staff  It s in a good location to see the old town part of Montreal  The room we stayed in was on the side of the hotel on the rd floor and we found it a little noisy from the street traffic below  If you plan on staying out late this won t bother you  The rooms were nice with old beams in the walls and ceiling  The furniture was modern hotel furniture no antiques  We paid apx   a night for  adults We were given a full menu breakfast or a food bar for free each morning  The breakfast was very good  We had a variety of breakfasts the  days we were there and we were pleased with every bit of it  Evenings we were offered free wine and cheese  This was a welcome touch  I would recommend this hotel  
N => Neat find Neat location on the front facing the port  We had a room overlooking the port so wed open the windows and let the fresh air in hear the noises from the street below and relax Quirky rooms   nothing had a right angle which in part is what made it neat  Bathroom was a ent size the shower was tight  The room itself was plenty large enough and quite comfortable  Not modern but more importantly not dated  It was exceptionally clean Breakfast was nice  We had dinner in Les Ramparts which was OK  It was a little too quiet and hence lacked some atmosphere  Had wine and cheese every night which was basic but their reception areabreakfastwine bar is cute so neat to hang out and look out and watch the traffic   Service was exceptional They actually care whether you have a good time a rare thing nowadays Would stay there again      
N => A hidden jewel My husband and I just returned from a wonderful weekend at Auberge du Vieux Port  Everything was just perfect just as we expected  Staff was welcoming friendly and knowledgeable always eager to assist us  Room had an intimate romantic feel and our dinner in the hotels restaurant Ramparts was our best dining experience ever  We will definitely stay here again and recommend it to all 
N => Wonderful Stay My family just returned from a pre Christmas weekend at the Auberge du Viex Port in Montreal  The room was beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable  The best part was the exceptional attitude of the staff  They made sure we had recommendations of where to go and suggestions for dinner  They were friendly and gracious  One evening the desk man even sought us out to make sure we knew there were fireworks over the river that night  When we arrived we asked for additional robes and they were delivered within  minutes  This is a place we will return to  The Rue St Paul side was noisy at night  but quieter than many large cities we have visited  The location is excellent and everything we wanted to see was within walking distance  Our experience at The Auberge made our first trip to Montreal quite a delight  
N => Worst hotel service I have ever experienced I didnt stay  They didnt have my room so they talked me into a supposedly quotbetterquot room at a cheaper rate since it only had one bed and we had reserved a room with two beds  Better The bed was in a loft space Im too tall to walk in and the smelly Motel  in Hollywood had cleaner bathrooms than this place  There was a nasty mildew covered shower in place of the jacuzzi tub the room I reserved had and this was all up several steep flights of stairs a few blocks from the hotel  And not only was I offered no apologies for them not having my room but they tried to blame it on me telling me I had booked the room for an earlier date and was a no show  Too bad for them I had my confirmation email as proof  Too bad for me Im still dealing with the paperwork disputing the no show charge to my credit card  They treated me like dirt  Im young but I travel a lot both for work and for fun  Ive seen everything from excellent customer service the Gaylord Opreyland hotel in Nashville treated me like a queen to non existent service Motel   Id take a Motel  over the Auberge du Vieux Port anyday  Then itd only be  to dispute on my credit card instead of   And the bathroom would be cleaner yes it was that bad  
N => Wonderful Just returned from a  night stay at this property  We found the staff to be friendly and helpful  Our room faced the river and was beautifully furnished The accomodations were great  We really enjoyed the jacuzzi and toiletries that were provided The daily breakfast was good  Service a little lax  more a matter of not quite knowing who the server for your table was  Nightly wine and cheese was another plus  We had dinner at Les Remparts one evening and the waitstaff was excellent as was the food and service The location of the hotel was convenient to the metro and Old Port We will return again  
N => Prententious and Overpriced We have very little good to say about this dinghy over priced prententious hotel Arriving at   p m  after a long flight our room was not ready until  p m  The room was OK in the old French style but could not be compared to other hotels such as riot Best Western for comfort  The TV controls did not work and despite repeated calls were not repaired The dinner in their restaurant was a disaster over priced again small Sea Bass in a pile on the plate tasted awful The Wine welcome with cheese was indescribable the wine was tart and the cheese was crumbled  The service was a joke Breakfast consisted of two cold fried eggs with lumps of fried potatoes all luke warm  One guest sent her breakfast back twice before trying to eat it We complained and was told they were aware of problem  Breakfast next day was better but noticed one coffee jug for twenty persons and that the waiters and waitresses were not skilled in their functions or attentive The sweet cakes provided were good The hotel was gloomy and dark there were always laundry baskets outside our room on first floor which was spacious but overlooked a noisy street A good point was the free Internet access  Its situation is near to the Port which was full of vagrants and panhandlers  Do not sit on the benches  The area is not very attractive and there is little to see We did not enjoy staying here it was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in having travelled extensively and the staff embarrased were aware of it We found the receptionists very helpful arranging tickets to theatre and giving directions however that is what they are paid to do Cannot be recommended and we left Montreal a day earlier being very disappointed that this hotel charged more and gave less than the Freemont in Victoria or the Pan Pacific in Vancouver 
N => had a great time   Wonderful place to stay   a little noisy but if you stay in the center of it all   you better expect it  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable  A definite recommendation 
N => Think twice before staying here My family and I stayed at the Auberge for  nights beginning e th it was our second time at the hotel since  years ago  The services and standards of the hotel have dropped tremendously  Quite disappointing  From the moment of our arrival the hotels services were in disarray  First they did not have any bellman to help us with our luggage we were a family of  and were staying in one of their so called lofts  There were no elevators yet were promised a loft on the first floor  To our surprise we were  floors up If we would have known we would never have stayed here  The loft was missing towels and the air condition was not working  Management told us we would have to wait till the next day before it was fixed it was fixed the day before our departure For the first  days no one came to clean the room so I made a complaint and the general manager came to make my bed This should not happen in a good hotel The staff at the hotel were friendly yet seemed as if they did not want to be there  I asked for some activities for my girls and was told always the same thing    the jazz festival  It was nice but not everyday Recommendations for restaurants were so so  The staff always chose restaurants that belong to the same owners  as if trained to repeat the same thing  We ided to chose our own restaurants because Montreal is blessed with great restaurants  The staff lacked knowledgable recommendations We ate at Les Remparts one evening food was excellent but service was terrible  The staff seemed as if they were all on their first day Breakfast was very good and morning staff very friendly All in all it was not a memorable stay in Montreal  Would I stay there again   NO  Would I recommend it to a friend   sure if I want my friend to waste his money  There are many good hotels in Montreal and this one seems to be lowering their standards  
N => Read me I wont disappoint I recently stayed at the Auberge du Viex Port with my wife and absolutely adored it  Apart from some noise of the construction of the new bar and lounge you dont need to worry about that because it was almost finished on our departure the weekend was perfect I made our rsvp only a week before and was treated like an old friend by the concierge  I explained to him about my idea for a romantic getaway and he explained all rates and types of rooms  Because of short notice I had to switch rooms during our stay  As the concierge explained not much of a hassle we prepared our bags in the morning the valets took our bags and moved everything while we were out  We just picked up the key at the reception when we got back  It gave us a chance to experience both views of the hotel They both have their own beauty  Anyways check in was informative and efficient and when we entered the room my wife was shocked to see a flower arrangemnet  concierges idea She fell in love again That evening supper was downstairs in their french restaurant Magnifique It was wonderful The concierge also arranged for a horse drawn carriage to pick us up after supper and take a tour of the old city  It was cold But romantic  We had smoked salmon for breakfast great menu included in the rate of the room Overall the weekend was fabulos from the service to the room Thank you Eric Russ Hugoamp Brian  Reccommendations  x YES 
N => Loves Auberge due Vieux Port Montreal We spent  nights beginning of   at Auberge du Vieux Port and upon our arrival we knew we chose the right place  They met our taxi and took our bags into this small hotel facing the St  Lawrence then invited us to go down to their restaurant Ramparts downstairs to partake of their evening complimentary wine and cheese for guests from   each evening  We needed this  after our long day of travel  While relaxing with our wine our bags were taken to our room and we checked in after our wine  The rooms we started first night in a loft room as we arrived on a Sat  and the hotel was full then moved to the hotel for the next  nights  Both rooms were very nice but the loft wasnt for us     too many stairs and we like to be situated in the hotel to really enjoy the amenities more easily  The loft however would be great for a family as it had a small kitchen and a very large sittingdining area  The breakfasts were very good    small buffet of baked goods fruit juices coffee cereal plus you can in addition order from the menu  Robes and slippers stocked bar and old world style furnishings made the roomsstay so pleasant  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful  We mainly dealt with David at check in and when changing rooms    and he was very nice and helpful  They volunteered to make any reservations we wanted  We highly recommend this hotel and especially Old Montreal    if you want a relaxing romantic and charming experience   surrounded by good restaurants Bonaparts Pavarotti are a couple  Didnt get a chance to try Ramparts which is in this hotel  We did alot of walking downtown Monreal on St  Catherines and were glad we didnt choose a hotel there    location to many restaurants good but the noise     rap music playing very loudly    not for us 
N => Our experience was tres bien A recent visit to Montreal included a stay at this wonderfully warm and friendly establishment We found the rooms to be comfortable well furnished and quite beautiful the views from the open floor to ceiling windows breath taking and the food at Les Ramparts exceptional The accomodating and extremely friendly staff combined with everything else about this fine establishment made our visit one to remember We highly recommend a night at Auberge du Vieux PortT L  
N => Good But      
N => Excellent Inn  
N => Excellent Value We stayed in the hotel for three nights over the th of y weekend  This hotel offers excellent value  We found the location perfect within easy walking distance to Old Montreal and other sites Our room was small but impeccably clean  We will gladly stay there again  
N => Tiny Room Too Pricy Just came back from a one night stay at Le Pomerol  Although advertisements show and staff talk about what beautiful rooms they have to offer I found it to be a very disappointing experience  The superior room that I had reserved was almost the size of my walk in closet with barely  feet to get around the  sides of the bed   Carpet was cheap and old commercial type anf floor was quite uneven  The closet was also improvised with a curtain hanging from the ceiling and although their website shows off the superior room with a double whirpool bath in a corner by the bed our single tub was tucked in a very small washroom  Noise was also an issue  People above us woke us up that morning as we could follow their every footsteps in the room  Definitely not a place that I will return to even though they proudly display the award they won this year at their reception desk  Disappointing when you travel to Montreal to see a cultural event that was booked a long time ago  Fortunately the show was worth it but not the auberge  
N => Good location bad experience My boyfriend and I drove  hours from Toronto and stayed  nights at the Pomerol  Naturally sleep is very important for us  Upon arrival the d cor and ambience was better than we had anticipated  But hidden under the fa ade was exposed pipes in storage room and water noises from the pipes  The Jacuzzi feature advertised was bogus  It was there alright but it didn t work  My boyfriend went to the front desk personally to tell them of the problem but was told that he ll send a technician up the next day to fix it or else he ll give us a rebate  He didn t even come up to look at it The room is not sound  proof  Every time the neighbor turns on the tap to wash hands or to shower we could hear  Imagine awoken up abruptly by that noise at  am We complained about the noise in the morning and was told that our  neighbor  had checked out and we won t face that problem again nd day we came back at night  The Jacuzzi still wasn t fixed so we thought we ll have a rebate  But the water noise was still there  It seems we had a NEW neighbor  Good thing they slept early  Check out  I asked about the rebate and was told that she was not informed of such arrangements and said that we were already taking the special deal and so it was not possible a further discount Good point It has an excellent location  
N => Never Again This hotel I stayed at based on the good reviews I had found at BBSelect a Canadian BampB booking agency  Unfortunately they turned out to be dead wrong  The hotel staff treated me like I was a college student in a dormitory which I do not and did not appreciate  The evening man was very unfriendly and when I told him how rude he was to me and my friends the manager simply explained that basically this was the hotels quotinvisible policyquot and that to be upfront about it would offend even more guests  I replied that he and his staff were running a dormitory and not a hotel  Although tastefully orated I would never give these people my money again  They advertise in gay publications as being a gay friendly establishment nothing could have been further from the truth  
N => Absolutely fabulous My husband and I stayed at this hotel on our tripp to Montreal  We are from Europe and loved the little touches of European elegance that were given to the hotel  The manager was fantastic to deal with  We will be back for sure  
N => The Smoke Detectors Definitely Work We stayed for several days and had the pleasure of hearing the smoke detectors wail each time we used the whirlpool bath or shower  Quite ironic considering the hotel promotes itself as offering a tranquil ambiance  My tranquility was interrupted by an ear splitting smoke detector five minutes into my first whirlpool bath  I called the manager to see what could be done and was told to leave the door to our room open for a while  Think about that security risk for a minuteThe rooms look fine at first glance but can really use some touch ups  The towels are really thin small and scarce  The shower hardware fell off several times  The floor in our room was very uneven  The room was extremely small but at least it was clean  Overall a huge disappointment  The neighborhood is also sketchy  We will not be back  
N => Overall disappointing Overall it was a disappointment the room and lobby were A LOT smaller than the way the internet pics made them look the bathroom was closet size  The fire alarm went on every time we took a shower probably because the room was so small and it took several calls to locate the internet connection in the room and it turned out to be behind the dresser and not the desk which made no sense so we actually had to rearrange the furniture to be able to get some work done while we were there  The parking attendant was sullen and slow and there was no laundry or dry cleaning service or any form of it  Finally my travelers checks were turned down because there were in US dollars and I had to go to a bank and pay the commission to come back with cash to pay the hotel bill  On the plus side it was nice to have free internet in the room and local calls were free  It was also very nice to have a constant supply of breakfast type foods and beverages downstairs  The restaurant attenant to the hotel was good and reasonable and had very good service  The furniture in the rooms was nicer and showed attention to details  I think the main problem is that the hotel misrepresents itself in the web site which makes it look a lot more geared toward business travelers and spacier with a lot more staff and services than it actually is  
N => Exceeds my expectation I stayed a couple of days in Hilton Quebec City for business prior to traveling to Montreal  This was a side trip and I didnt want to spend too much money so I booked the Y hotel with not much expectation since I paid about  per night only  It turned out to be a pleasant experience  The facility is old and cannot be compared to Hilton but the room is almost as spacious as the  star hotel I stayed previously  The kitchen facility is a great bonus even though I didnt really use it  My guest visitors were also very impressed when they came to visit me  
N => Dont even waist your money ya the rooms are small I went with my husband and son the beds were comfortable but the service ahhh no     you know what dont even waist your time at the time of check in we requested a queen size bed they didnt have it available we made the reservation a few days ago so they gave us another room at no extra charge but they wanted a  deposit incase you rent a movie    anyway yes the bathroom is small and they had running hot water but when it was time to check out the receptionist said ya you get your   back they put it back in your account so my husband called the credit card company to see if they put back the money     the receptionist lied so my husband went back and had to complain the receptionist gave us the run around so on top of that they gave us the money back in cash    and the parking lot was across the street from the hotel     so if i were you dont bother going to this hotel i hope you make the st ision 
N => Nice but small  Comfort Level  rooms great location Room was small but in great shape price was great awesome location Cora restaurant in hotel only serves breakfast food  Would stay again for one overnight  
N => OK Good location ent room  The staff were just okay  We booked a person room through AAA however they gave us problems when we checked in  I didnt like how we were treated which was too bad because I liked the bartender  He gave us more inside information than the staff and he certainly had more smiles Parking was a bit off site but it is a city 
N => Small Room Pretty clean hotel booked it to save some money after wish I had spent a little more  Was basically a bed in this tiny room hard to walk around the bed  One receptionist was great the other very rude because I was anglo If money is and issue then this is an okay option close to Bell Centre Go Habs Go 
N => I was disappointed We got a good deal so we booked this hotel  When we arrived we found out that the pool was closed for repair and that the higher floors were also closed for repairs due to the fact that the hotel was not busy  The room we were first given was tiny and one of the lamps had no bulb in it  The worst part was the location  It faced a court yard where if people were outside they would literally be able to look right into the room  After complaining we were offered another room which was only slightly better  We finally ided to pay a little more for a king sized room  This room was much larger and the bed was great although the room could have been orated a little nicer  We were two people but were only supplied with one bar of soap so we asked at the front desk for more soap  We went out and were told that it would be brought up to our room  This never happened  We had to request it a second time  We discovered late at night that the shower drain was not working properly which meant that the bathtub would fill up rapidly while taking a shower  When we mentioned this to the front desk at checkout the next morning requesting some compensation for the lack of good facilities we were told that we should have called for someone to come up and fix the shower or ask to be moved to another room  Given that it was late by the time we took our showers and that we had already moved rooms we were too tired to do that  The person at the front desk was not very friendly and did not offer any kind of apology or compensation  
N => okay  good location hotel was in good location right in the main part of city  lobby was very weird and abit off putting   large weird statue in fountain  odd very odd room was fine nice and comfy and big enough just standard  star hotel room    staff were not that friendly    cheap good breakfast downstairs    we got very cheap price i would not pay too much for this   wasnt bad just try something else    unless you get it very cheap    
N => Hardly worth the cheaper rate Why so bad   Bathroom in lobby contained several non flushing toilets filled with feces  Lobby was orated strangely looked like the inside of a swimming pool  Hotel room so tiny that a bed and dresser wouldnt fit in it  Dresser drawers could only be opened half way and one had to squeeze around furniture items Understaffed at front desk takes half an hour to speak with anyone at front desk This is typical of all Best Westerns  Also we overheard staff being argumentativedisrespectful with customers Did not get a wink of sleep since ice machine was loud used all night long and could be clearly heard outside thin hotel room door Pair of leather boots we accidentally left in hotel room had mysteriously vanished when we tried to collect them  days later  Hotel staff member gains new pair of bootsWhy did we choose itBecause we got a good rate for it from Booking com   CAD   Best Western is st enough to know that they wouldnt get customers otherwise Worth it Probably not  
N => loved this hotel I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel  I was there during the easter weekend the staff was great the rooms were extremely clean it was closed to my meetings  i will visit again with my family  
N => Great location     The hotel had a great location  We parked the car when we arrived and walked around to the places we needed to go  We parked in a lot across the street for  per day  St  Catherine Street is the next street up and there was a lot of places to shop and eat  We were a little taken back by the size of our king size room  The area that the bed was in was very small  We considered asking to upgrade to a larger room  The bathroom was large and the mirror was big enough for two people to use at the same time  The restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch had very poor service  Our waitress basically disappeared and we had to ask another waitress for our check  The food that we chose was not good awful crepes  We used the hotel website and prepaid online so it was only   plus taxes so for that price it was reasonable  We are going to Montreal again in ch and I have already booked a different hotel  
N => Great little hotel We stayed here for  nights on the Thanksgiving CDN long weekend and have nothing but good things to say about it  Our first trip to Montr al so we ended up asking hotel staff for directions numerous times they couldnt have been more helpful  On their website they advertise a poolgymhottub but we didnt find any of them in the hotel not a deal breaker though as we werent in town to visit the hotel Yes the quotthemequot is a little  Leagues Under The Sea ish but the hotel bar has a very nice vibe to it captains quarters it seemed for a quick drink  Theres a nice breakfast restaurant attached which was a late discovery on our part definitely head there if you want to treat yourself to a good breakfast Location couldnt be better literally a  second walk from Rue St Catherine and under  mins from Rue Crescent     as we walked around we looked for similarly priced hotels with as good a location be there are some but we couldnt find any Rooms are small but we didnt find it a problem bathrooms are tight and the toilet can get even tighter  We would definitely go back if not for the location then for the friendly service of the hotel staff  I see a lot of the negative reviews were written a number of years ago be there was a management change but we didnt encounter any quotrudequot employees  even the cleaning staff was very pleasant when wed run into them in the halls We would recommend it  
N => Fine with us We were very satisfied with this hotel  We booked short notice two days ahead and paid    It is a short walk from the train station when we arrived around noon our room was not ready but the reception desk kindly offered to store our luggage  We took off for lunch and returned a few hours later but the room was still not ready  The staff were very apologetic and offered us a jacuzzi suite so we were pleased  The room was lovely We had a great nights sleep and did not here any street noise  We went down for breakfast and had lots of fruit etc  Our train did not leave until after check out time but reception offered to store our luggage again which we thought was quite nice  The location of this hotel is super  Im not sure if we just got lucky or if the rooms are being reated but we had no complaints about anything 
N => Not bad really I guess it all depends on the traveller  I wouldnt stay here on a romantic weekend with my wife but the purpose of my stay here was to go to the Hockey game with my buddiesThe location is perfect as mentioned in other reviews and it is about a two minute walk to Centre Bell  One of the closest hotels to the arena  I think I was also blessed with the only large room of all the reviews  There was more than enough space in our double room I really is good value  
N => More that happy to return We stayed here for  nights while at the F Grand Prix  Excellent hotel  clean staff polite and smiling Great free breakfast  more than enough to keep us going all day   Free bottle water amp fruit on offer all day in the lobby Pleasent hotel bar to retrun too at night  More than happy to return to hotel if I every come back to Montreal  As all Montreal hotels   cost more than normal that weekend due to the F 
N => I was very unhappy In general I love the BW hotels  This one was easy to find  Centrally located  We asked for a quiet room we got a room facing the street  Hotel has no parking parking opposite charged CAD   add it to the price of the hotel and the deal is no deal  The room was tiny  We paid cash gave the visa card as guarantee  Got back the visa slip the next day found a month later that we have been debited for an extra CAD  and cannot get a reply why  Dont go there before you check all details  
N => no complaints My sister from British Columbia met me in Montreal for the weekend myself coming from a Scotia   Location location locationWe booked this place before reading the reviews   so glad we did because I read a lot of negative reviews amp was worried  it was all for not  the desk staff was sooo friendly amp accomadating the restaurant staff was friendlyamp the room was as good as you can expect for the price you would pay anywhere else  The location was the best we couldve gotten  right downtownit was all there  had to add my  cents worth  Cathy 
N => Unprepared hostile and a fire hazard  While on a band trip with my school concert band and choir we stayed in the Best Western Europa Hotel  After I was checked in we attempted to enter our rooms  Their card key system did not work  I needed to get our room keys cards reprogramed seven times on the first day and many times later during our three night trip  The cleaner used in my rooms left a bad odor  Although some staff members were helpful kind and a pleasure to talk to others were not  Prank callers phoned in and asked for a wake up call at two in the morning for my room and the reception desk called us at eleven thirty PM to confirm the call  After I said that I did not want a wake up call that early and that it must have been a prank call the lobby told me that they could not prevent the call as it was already entered into the computer  Why bother comfirming if they could not change it This happened again but I found out about it while going down to fix my room key before it was entered  What I found most ensulting about this hotel was the security gaurd who used told a client also on my trip to quotshut upquot also using profanities  The ice machines were all broken but one on the fifth floor the second floor vending machine ate your money and had no quotout of order signquot  All the other ones were unstocked on many things  The maids who were very nice seemed overworked  Worst of all the hotel only had one flight of stairs that did not open into the lobby instead to an ally beside this door had an alarm but no warning of one  Not only did this make the elevators extremely busy but also if there was a fire in the ally that had spread into the north end of the hotel there would be no escape route as would there be none for the first floor if the lobby was ablaze  The lobby workers were not helpful in giving directions either  
N => Not as bad as everyone else thinks As two young travelers we really enjoyed our stay at this best western  our room was exceptionally large and spacey  and the bathroom was actually a good size and had complimentary pantene pro v shampoo and dove body wash the location of the hotel was great because it is right off of st  catherines str  the service was great and we arrived around noon and we were able to check in early with no problem  the staff was very kind and considerate but there was a little mix up with the hotel price which was taken care of quickly and with no problems at night when we would return we felt very safe since there was a security officer waiting to greet us and let us in  The only real problem we had was the price of parking which was  which is inconvenient since parking is usually free  also the windows should not be sealed shut  having fresh air would have been nice  All in all we had a great stay and would definitely stay there again 
N => Not that bad   a bit odd We had two nights here and found the location excellent  The room was OK and the high speed internet access worked fine unlike another Best Western we stayed in  We disliked the lack of fresh air in the room   unable to open the windows or adjust the aircon to allow fresh air in The public rooms are orated on a theme of  Leagues Under the Sea by es Verne   distinctive but not to my tasteThe guy overseeing breakfasts was very friendly and helpful   other staff less so  
N => Worst   We Renamed it The Cave For night you and your partner can stay in a closet   the space was the smallest room we have ever encountered in our travels  Thus we upgraded to night   we could both walk around the bed at the same time However the view of the brick wall did not change from that of the first room  Also this was a smoking room with no ventilation and windows that were sealed shut  By morning our throats and nostrils were burning  By the way we bought a bottle of wine no corkscrew in the room no fridge for that matter  Front desk would not loan us the corkscrew and we had to bring the bottle down to them This six story poorly kept hotel is a definate no no in Montreal or anywhere  There are many affordable places to stay in Montreal  We checked out first thing and moved to another hotel  
N => Not recommended Simple  I would just stay somewhere else  The room we stayed in felt dirty and cheap  The staff were horrendous in they way they treat you  i stayed at  hotels in Canda on my trip  were Best westerns  This was by far the worst  They argued with me about charges then the next day they were myseriously missing off the bill  the bell boy informed me i had to tip him and when i informed the manager that i would ide when to tip someone she replied that they do not do that sort of thing there  I hope she tells the bell boy  Looking around there were more than enough hotels in the area for the same price if not cheaper so why take the risk  
N => Best Western Europa   Montreal We found your review to be right on Location is great lobby bordering tacky food was okay room was small bathroom extremely small heard other alarm clocks from empty rooms CONTINUOUSLY reported to lobby with no result and not real clean  
N => Small but servicable  
N => Good Place to Stay  
N => Dont stay here  
N => Amazing Service Travelled to Montreal on business   hotel is in a great location   Downtown Montreal  Room was comfortable and clean but what really made my stay was the service received by staff members  The concierge was superb   remembered me every morning and when I would return back to the hotel in the afternoon   he would remember where I was going in the morning and made it conversation  Front Desk very friendly  Even the General Manager greeted me in the morning while in the lobby waiting for a taxi  They have a great restaurant   if you like Meditteranean food   its a must to try but really liked the cafe attached to the hotel   nice spot to have a coffee and do some work wireless internet available Overall   great experience for the price I paid   I will definetely be returning back  
N => Bad hotel for business be ok for leisure This hotel has one big deal breaker if you are on business  They have a bizarre arcane limit of MB of data traffic over wireless in any  hour period  If you go over and Im not sure how I did just working on my work wiki they cant reset it your MAC address is blocked  Supposedly just for  hours but mine never came back on I was locked out of wireless with work to do  There isnt even an option to pay for more bandwidth the hotel has no control over this system  If you are in town on business find a different hotel  
N => Worst hotel experience Ever Worst experience of my life I was threatened mocked and treated badly by rude staff  Rooms were old fashioned  My experience was so bad that it forced me to call  after feeling very insecure after staff broke into my room  Manager Salem tohme is the most unreasonable man   and needs some customer service classes  Almost charged  for crushed popcorn on the floor until I ided to take on housekeeping job and vacumn the floor they said would take  minutes  Good location though  Would NEVER EVER reccomend to stay here uless you like unprofessional staff and haunting memories  Ruined my New years 
N => Start of a great tour Currently in the midst of our North American vacation and having such a lovely time that we thought we would start writing about our journeys  One of the stops on our tour was the Ville ie which is part of the Best Western chain  We were not too familiar with this franchise as they are not too large where we are from but we had to admit that it was simply a charming property with an abundance of European influence  As it was our first time in Montreal we were ever so grateful for the aide which the staff provided  The location was quite handy for us to walk everywhere and the maps made available to us by the staff were most helpful  There was a restaurant in the hotel however we only used it for breakfast and we chose to have our dinners in the city and experience the local culture  Again the service of the hotel was most kind to recommend places to dine  As we spent most of our time touring we did not spend much time in the room but can assure you that they were clean comfortable and quite affordable  The Ville ie certainly started our trip on the right foot  
N => Unbelievable Service One thing about this hotel that makes it better than other hotels Ive been to is the service from the staff  Rooms are not high end but what we expected  The staff    EXCEPTIONAL  The concierge took his time giving us detailed info about the city  The front desk and in particular Peter were truly amazing  Bending over backwards to give us service and answer our questions  Housekeeping staff kept our room immaculate  All in all a very nice change these days when you can go somewhere and get truly exceptional customer service  Would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat  
N => horrible We stayed at this hotel and I have to say it was horrible They made us pay for a movie we didnt see the room was dirty and in desperate need of a reation and when we ordered room service it took  minutes to come When I talked to the manager about our problems he basicly ignored me put it down to my being a woman  
N => Quiet and pleasant Liked this hotel  Very quiet   was actually given room to self when requested quiet  Would stay there again  Very good  Close to downtown but not in nightime noisy street  
N => Very dissappointed   poor quality motel   never mind a four star HORRIBLE HOTEL NEEDS to be reated really bad DEFENITELY not a four star as advertised   I WOULD really have to complain    Staff is nice but worthless after horrible rooms pastic tiles and tab and the oldest elevator I have been since eastern europe I am not a picky person but paying  dollars a night you would think you stay somewhere ent TRUST ME   do not stay in that hotel   lots others to choose from  
N => Do not stay at this hotel This hotel was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at  My friends and I had an exciting weekend planned in downtown Montreal  We had originally booked a non smoking room  I guaranteed it using my credit card  When we arrived at the hotel which was at about  am we found out there were no non smoking rooms available  The person at the desk told me that I did not reserve a non smoking room  He then blatantly lied to me that he checked the reservation system  Because when I called Best Western they checked and it clearly said NON SMOKING  Anyways we had to settle for a smoking suite  We soon realized that the suite had a leaking ceiling  They told us they would work on the ceiling  In addition the room was extremely musti and one of my friends had an asthma condition  Because of the smoke she was not in the best shape  They then promised us another room  They explicitly told us that we could get another non smoking room as a room had cleared up  But then when we got back to the hotel after a few hours they said they had fixed the ceiling and that there were still no rooms available  The hotel did absolutely nothing for us  They couldnt move us to another room because the hotel was packed  For our troubles they gave us a  credit for the cott we used  In addition they gave us a complimentary suit cover that said Best Western  We were not impressed  We filed a complaint with the Best Western Customer Service  The general manager replied that there was nothing else he could do  The general manager explicitly told me quotSir we had to maximize our revenue that night quot Please do not stay here  This hotel doesnt deserve squat  They do not deserve to be licensed  They do not deserve to be standing on the ground they are on  In the end Best Western Customer Service gave us  free nights by crediting us Gold Crown Points  The hotel is independently owned so they can do whatever they choose to do to their customers  Best Western Customer service was even surprised at how poorly the hotel handled the situation  The general manager is simply not a nice person and has no feelings towards his customers  These are the plain facts  Email me if you have any questions or concerns about what happened  
N => Would not stay at this hotel again   
N => Nowhere near a  star  
N => Not a  star hotel  
N => Blood on pillows The worst stay we have ever had  there was blood BLOOD on the pillows once we showed the manager he said there was nothing he could do and then was rude to our entire party  housekeeping cleaned our room once during a  night stay and asked for a tip the day they cleaned it never cleaned it again   i guess  wasnt good enough  there is security running around with their friends during the nights and treating guests like intruders  security also tried accuse us of stealing a laptop that they later found   quotthey misplaced itquot but did threaten to beat us up with their frinds prior to finding it  dont ever stay here this hotel is not clean the staff are rude and the rooms are not worth the rates valet is a joke the only good thing about the trip was leaving this hotel for good  
N => good location space but kitchen poorly equiped and internet S L O W Lots of room in the suite and pretty well located  Valet parking via HI Express next door    that worked ok but sometimes had to wait a while for the valet  Reception desk at the Candlewood a bit understaffed and although the kitchen had good builtin units fridge full cooker etc it was difficult to make full use of them e g  no oven tray or any oven proof dish no sharp knife to chop vegetables     The wifi was free but excruciatingly SLOW  Impossible to get more than one pillow for each of the four of us  
N => Dont Waste Your Time Go Next Door to the Holiday Inn Express All I have to say is dont waste your time The hotel is not worth your money  I have stayed at Candelwood hotels before and have had zero problems  The location of the hotel is good right near St Laurent ST  Check in was slow only one guy was working which is sad for a Saturday  The service is HORRIBLE I asked for some wine glasses at pm when I checked in  Didnt get them till pm after calling the front desk over three times  To top it off the front desk guy was rude about the situation  We requested a late check out and when it was time they claimed nothing was in the system  I warn you DO NOT valet your car with this hotel  We made that mistake and then found out that the valet was driving our car around in the parking lot not only was he driving our car around  We saw him speeding around in the lot and smashed the bumper of one of the other guests cars  After reporting the incident to the hotel all they could say was that they have warned the valet attendant before  We where furious and requested to speak with the Hotel Manager so that he could see the attendant driving our car  We wee told that he only comes in on Monday and he would give us a call  Were still waiting for the call  
N => Very comfortable and wonderful accomodation My husband and I visited Montreal to see the International Jazz Fest I read about this hotel online and telephoned from Alberta noI do not speak French and the telephone was answered by a very warmfriendlyhelpful employee She knew the areaspoke English no problemtold me about the hotelpointed out the fact that there was no daily maid serviceI booked the room immediately I was very impressed and I must say that I was even happier on arrival The employees I dealt with were absolutely wonderful and I feel they were key to a pleasant stay The room was awesomeit was actually a suitefelt almost like being at home rather than a run of the mill hotel room The location was perfect we were walking distance to all our destinations jazz festold Montrealbus stationtrain station Our first room had a view of the courtyardsecond one overlooked old Montrealwowbeautiful My second stay at Candlewood Suites has a bit of a twist My husband and I were Via Rail mis scheduling victims as a result we missed a concert and had no alternative but to return to Montreal at a mabsolutely tired and frustratedwith no place to stay I called Candlewood Suites to see if they had a room at ish a mnot only did they have a roomwhewthey let me check in early To me this was totally above and beyond the call and I will remember and appreciate this always I cant say I disliked anythingMontreal and its people are wonderful and I look forward to visiting again And I definitely would stay at Candlewood Suites again  
N => It depends on what are you looking for The hotel isn t that bad spacious rooms with kitchenette free internet and ent location  It is actually a good family hotel and even a ent value for money from this perspective  But I was travelling for business and have to say that this facility simply did not fit to my needs for the following reasons  I checked in after midnight because of delayed arrival  I was sick tired and starving but there was no restaurant room service or any food to grasp  I had to get out and grab some fast food crap as the only available option   The room smelt of cooked food and had to leave the window open  Luckily enough it wasn t winter as yet  The following day when I came back in the evening I found out that my room had not neem cleaned and made up Overall this hotel  be a choice only if you are looking for an inexpensive well located family accommodation  Anything else is to be forgotten  
N => Good hotel let down by offhand staff I stayed one night at this hotel in ruary  and had a bad experience  On arrival I was checked in to a room that was not yet made up and I made the mistake of not insisting on another room  Instead I unpacked in order to be able to re use my shoulder bag with receptions agreement and assurance that the room was just about to be serviced and returned an hour later to find that it had still not been done and the chambermaid was just king my property as having been left behind by the previous occupant  I found the reception staff offhand in dealing with this situation and generally a bit flippant  That said this hotel has many good points not least the size of the rooms and its convenient location and I would give it another try provided it represented a good deal  
N => Be aware if you book the Candlewood on their own website We booked an one bedroom suite in this hotel because we were traveling with our  months old son The fact that it had a arate bedroom was the main reason for us to choose for the Candlewood  When we checked in they put us in a small studio  When we tried to get that changed they said that this was not possible because they were full booked that night  Than we explained that we had a pre paid reservation for an one bedroom suite which we made on their own website and we traveled with a small child which had to be in bed at  pm and needed a two hour nap at noon  If we knew we got a studio we could have gone to another place  Eventually after a lot of discussion they allowed us to change to an one bedroom suite the following night They said they could do nothing about it and that they had this problem before with people who booked via their website When we asked if we could speak to the manager they told us that the management was not in at weekends it was a Saturday When we returned to the desk on Monday they told us again that there was no manager on site  We wanted to get a refund because we didn t get what we paid for  They guy at the desk who was really helpful in contrary to the woman at the desk on Saturday put himself to a lot of effort to get someone from the management on the phone  When he finally succeeded in that we had to do a lot of negotiation to actually get a refund  I think this is a shame because they made the mistake The rooms of this hotel are really good and the location is great but because of the treatment we got we definitely will NOT recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Huge Suites in Average Location We stayed here for one night after arriving in Montreal on a cruise  We used my husbands Priority Club points for the room  On the positive side our suite was huge     arate bedrooms a large living room a kitchen area and bathroom  We slept comfortably and soundly despite the Montreal Jazz Festival taking place on the street behind the hotel  And in room Wifi was free Although located within  min  walking distance of the touristy part of town I wouldnt say it was a particularly attractive area  Its on a busy street and we had to walk through Chinatown and streets devoid of anything interesting to get down to the tourist section  The front desk worker seemed overwhelmed by calls amp people trying to check into rooms that werent ready yet  Our suite had a touch of a stale smoky smell when we first walked in but we turned on the air and didnt notice it after awhile  Something was clearly wrong with the toilet as it made a really loud foghorn sound just like on the cruise ship moments after flushing  A repairman who had been sent up to fix the hot water in our kitchen sink apparently unsuccessfully attempted to address the toilet problem but wasnt successful at that either  Despite these issues I still think we overall got a better deal than my sisters family who used Priceline and stayed for night at the Intercontinental  Their room was tiny compared to ours and Internet cost extra  Would I stay there again though   probably not  
N => Fine basic hotel Four of us went for a weekend  The room was smaller than I expected with quotall rooms are suitesquot on the website  It was just a room with two large beds and a kitchen  It was clean  Smoke free on our floor smoking was allowed further up  The location was nice the staff was great  Very basic  
N => We recommend   
N => Its ok if        you manage to get a room to the back  We were luckly to get a room on short notice in the high season  Our room was clean and spacious but it went out to the front and Rue Sherbrooke is a very busy street so it was far too noisy for us  It was quite hot when we stayed there and there was not AC in our room so we would have liked to sleep with the window open but no way  Even with the windows closed it was noisy The hotel is conveniently situated for all kinds of sight seeing our room was clean and breakfast was inlcuded in our rate  The breakfast room though is stiflingly small and the breakfast is nothing to get excited about  
N => Old World Charm We visited Montreal ober   and couldnt have been more pleased with our stay at LArgoat  From reception to departure it was excellent The rooms were quiet the bathrooms small yet functional  Breakfast was OK and the Living Room had a common desk top computer to check emails on  Parking around back was included If you are going to Montreal to spend time in the city rather than your room LArgoat is the place to stay  
N => Not Recommended The weather during our early ober visit to Montreal was quite chilly  Some might even say cold  When I told the concierge that our room was cold and requested the heat be turned on I was told that heat would not be available until the following week  Had it not been for this serious lack of service I would classify this hotel as average as the room was small clean but adequate  I was greatly surprised by the number of effusive reviews as the Chateau de lArgoat lacks charm and does not provide particularly good value for the money  
N => A Nice Find  Wouldnt stay anywhere else  My boyfriend and I stayed here over the Labor Day weekend in the cheapest smallest room available we spent all our money on food and were pleasantly surprised to see that the room size was more than adequate  Small bathroom but everything was clean  except for a few stains on the comforter but Im not hugely fussy  The staff was very friendly and informative plus all spoke good to proficient English  The parking situation was a dream and the location perfect  The Wi Fi was a little spotty but no big deal We will definitely stay here next time and not take a gamble ever again and believe me Montreal has some hideous hotels hiding under the guise of a slick facade  Just stay here  
N => Highly Recommend My son and I spent  nights  We were there to visit McGill Univ  The location was great  Once there we didnt move the car til time to leave  We walked everywhere we needed to go  Mcgill is about  mile and we loved the quotRue Saint Denisquot area about  min walk  Lots of bars grills a movie theater and the like  Seemed like a very trendy area  Our room was the  bed with whirlpool bath  We wanted the smaller  bedroom but it was booked  This room was great  A very big bedroom flat screen large bathroom  It was sort of like a BampB  and very quaint  Staff was friendly and spoke english when needed all the time form me This is the place to stay  Avoid the big chains  
N => Mostly positive with one major gripe The positives free parking convenient location   walk two blocks to Rue St Denis and you are right in between the Quartier Latin and the Plateau  There are just tonnes of restaurants and cafes in both areas catering to virtually every cuisine  My recommendation is to walk up to Avenue Duluth  mins as there are some great restaurants there  We also walked to Chinatown and Old Montreal in about   min but there is a subway stop across the street from the hotel if you prefer to use that  tasty continental breakfast included though the waitress on our second morning gave us a far smaller ration of croissants and pain au chocolat than the first morning  nice rooms ours had a jacuzzi which was great after a day out  Of course you have to pay extra for rooms with a jacuzzi So   measly rounds of pain au chocolat aside   what was I annoyed about Well we had booked four nights but after two we felt that we wanted to move onto our next destination the next day ie after the third night  So at pm I went downstairs to ask if we could check out a night early  But I was two and a half hours late and they just would not budge on their  hour cancellation policy I was informing them   hours in advance  I asked if they had turned anyone away because it was full because in that case I would have agreed that it was fair I should pay up but they didnt seem to want to answer that question  I even offered to pay   but that wasnt acceptable either  Of course you  side with the hotel owner and say that policy is policy and I knew what I was signing up for at the beginning  But for the sake of me asking two and a half hours late when I was already paying half a grand for three nights I find this lack of goodwill disappointing and hence I give four rather than five stars  
N => We Would Do it Again We just got back from a lovely trip to Montreal and Quebec City  We have traveled a lot but this was the first time that we didnt choose a chain hotel listed in AAA  This boutique hotel was perfect  The staff was friendly and very helpful  The room was clean extremely quiet and had very interesting orations  The bathroom however was very small room  Parking was included as long as you were willing to leave your key and they had no problem letting us keep the car there for an extra  hours on day of checkout  The location was ideal the metro is about a block away actually had a choice of  stations and within easy walking distance to restaurants St  Denis Street  We were even able to walk to Old Montreal  We had bought a Montreal Pass for  which allowed unlimited use of the Metro or bus and entrance to most of the museums if used within  consecutive days  We loved the metro easy to get around clean frequent trains and it seemed safe The hotel served a limited continental breakfast served to you not buffet but adequate  Although the menu is in French most items can be figured out or the waitress does speak English  There are an unbelievable number of restaurants nearby of course a lot of French ones and they were all good  Our favorite restaurant however was a Spanish one called Pintxo off of St  Denis  The pork chops were great  We definitely would recommend this hotel and would stay here again  We did not miss the amenities of a big chain hotel  
N => A Nice Place to Stay I had a very good experience at Chateau de lArgoat  The staff was friendly and helpful  The room was very clean  It was not fancy in any way  It had an old tube TV  Basic cable  No pay per view movies  There was free WiFi in the room with a very strong fast connection  My room had a small bathroom and two double beds  There was one nice big window overlooking Rue Sherbrooke    I did not notice any street noise  The bed was comfortable  There is free parking around back  It is a very small lot but it also seems very safe  They let me park my car there until  on the day that I checked out     which was really fantastic  They serve a light breakfast which looked good     even though I didnt have time to sit down and eat it  Overall this hotel is a great value  Clean friendly and much more personal than the big chain hotels  I hope to stay here again sometime  
N => Very good stay My dhter  and I spent one night at the Chateau de lArgoat on  th and both enjoyed our stay  Warm welcome large and comfortable room  We had a  double bed bedroom facing the backyard with standard bathroom  The size of the bathroom is the only downside Ive found  Very small However plenty of hot water showerhead was not working very effectively    and very clean bathroom and towels  The morning receptionist I forgot to ask him his name but I thank him again was very nice and accepted to keep our car in the hotel parking until  p m  at no charge  This allowed us to go shopping on St  Denis Street without being forced to find a pay parking or to run to a parking meter every  hours  Greatly appreciated 
N => Quite a good hotel with a few annoying features We stayed at the hotel with my girl friend during our holiday  Mostly the hotel was quite good but it had a few annoying features  You seem to get better service if you speak French  We came to this conclusion partly because I speak French whereas my girl friend doesnt and she spoke in English  We didnt like being woken up every morning by the maid speaking in a loud voice and vacuum cleaning behind our door  The breakfast was good enough but a bit difficult because you have to order from a menu in French every slice of bread and every glass of juice arately  be some people like that I dont know  We also didnt find any newspapers in English at the hotel all were in French Nothing to complain about the room it was good while not exceptional  The location is good next to the subway station  
N => Great location about  steps from Metro stop great place Im glad to see Chateau LArgoat is rising up in the rankings in Montreal  Its a great place to stay   clean and with a terrific concierge service that helped us out to find different restaurants and the best way to get to the Science Centre  We were there to see the Body Worlds  exhibition  They also recommended a great Polish restaurant in Old Montreal where we really hung around on this vacation   the restaurant was called Stash similar pronunciation to sh  They have an internet ready computer thats helpful to find things to do and its just a terrific place to stay overall  
N => A Ive stayed there for a week end whit my husband and we had such a great time  Everyone at the hotel was so NICE we felt that they really cared about us and really wanted us to be comfortable The room was clean big enough for two people and quiet The breakfest was good they even have someone doing the service for us Its free to park your car Close to the subway and the Quartier Latin  We took a nice walk sunday morning Sherbrooke St Denis Ste Catherine   They really did everything they could to make our stay in Montreal easier  Its a really warm place and when Ill go back to Montreal Ill definetly stay there  I wont even look somewhere else With such good prices we had more than we pay for  
N => Horrible This hotel stunk   not even worth writing about it  Old and dirty and very unfriendly staff  With so many other beautiful hotels in Montreal stay there 
N => Charming Old Fashioned Hotel Chateau de lArgoat was a wonderful hotel in a great location  I was there with another single girlfriend and we had a great time  The hotel is conveniently next to the Latin Quarter St  Denis and St  Laurent streets which are all full of great shopping restaurants and night life  Also being next to the metro makes it very easy to get anywhere in the city The hotel itself is quaint charming and old fashioned  We had a top floor room with high ceilings facing the street  While we did get a bit of street noise it was not enough to be a bother  The temperature in the rooms was great and we did not have the overwhelmingly loud air conditioning that is common in most U S  hotel rooms  The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything we needed from making us reservations to supplying amenities  There was free  hour Internet access and breakfast which was served until  noonIt is not a  star hotel but for the money you cant get a better value  I will definitely stay there the next time I go back to Montreal 
N => A welcome in Montreal Id just like to recommend Hotel Chateau de lArgoat to anybody looking to stay in Montreal It is a small very well run family hotel  We found all of the staff very friendly and helpful and the place itself had a welcoming feel to it The room we had was a very pleasant large one at the front there was a little road noise but not enough to be a problem  We were told that the bathroom would be small in this particular room and it was but it was quite adequate and as so many people have pointed out extremely clean  I believe most of the other rooms have ent sized bathrooms  Breakfast was excellent with the opportunity to have as much as you could eat and drink all you had to do was ask for more A major asset to staying at this hotel for us was the free parking at the rear  Plus to get to the Metro you just cross the road walk up the side of the Hotel Plaza go through a small door which looked like a side door to the hotel and you are in a passage that takes you to the station If we ever go back to Montreal we shall certainly book the Hotel Chateau de lArgoat  
N => No problems at the Chateau I had been impressed by the reviews of this hotel as I was planning a long weekend in Montreal after Thanksgiving  Fortunately I was not disappointed  The hotel is in a great location just a few blocks away from the trendy streets of St  Denis and St  Laurent which have an incredible amount of dining shopping and nightlife options The room itself felt more like home than a chain hotel  It was cozy comfortable clean and more than adequate for our needs  As others have noted the bathroom was small but we chose a cheaper room  double beds without a whirlpool bath which was very affordable Finally I was very happy with the service I received at the Chateau  In contrast to the previous user we had NO PROBLEM with speaking English at the hotel or anywhere else  I am surprised by this comment as we found the hotel staff  and the city as a whole  to be friendly  I can only speak some basic French but really didnt need it regardless of where we went  However I always tried to begin conversations in French out of courtesy but most people automatically switched to English without hesitation when they realized we were English speaking Two other service notes   I didnt specify non smoking when I booked the room and was placed in a smoking room  However the staff was easily able to make the swtich for us upon request Im not sure how many people leave things in hotels but I left a jacket in the closet and realized it only after I had left  I called and I was thrilled to hear that they had found it  I am happy to say that the directrice Anne mailed it to me at the hotels expense  Thats where the personal service of a smaller hotel paid off  
N => Look elsewhere Encouraged by the great reviews posted here I was eager to stay at LArgoat  Well I was disappointed when I arrived  The hotel common areas are a lot pokier and rundown than I wouldve anticipated  As for service if youre fluent in French youll be fine here  If you are anything less than fluent Well you will be very disappointed by the treatment  My French is fine but the fact that I was anglo really got under peoples skins  I was quite amazed as a native Montrealer to find this kind of stuff still going on Especially in a hotel  I HATE to think of how these people will treat Americans Snooty is not the word   they were downright rude and unfriendly On the plus side the or of my room was magnificent  A real knockout of a room  The layout of the bathroom however was quite stupid  Sure it had a jacuzzi tub but it was so lacking in sinkspace that actitivites like shaving became a chore My biggest complaint however is that my non smoking room absolutely reeked of smoke  It obviously doubles as smokingnonsmoking as need arises  I was quite turned off the STENCH of smoke in the room  As a last complaint the parking situation is not great  There are spots in the back but you have to leave your keys with the front desk  And its not easy to get them back again With so many great options in Montreal Id recommend looking elsewhere  
N => Overly Pleased with LArgoat I didnt want to go with the typical chain hotel route so I settled on going to LArgoat after reading all the previous reviews on this site  I guess Ill be repeating what everyone else has been saying but I really enjoyed staying here  It had a quothome away from homequot feeling to it  I got the smallest size room that they have   but it was more than enough for just me  It had a double bed huge windows  drawer dresser a mini clothes rack with some hangers tv chair writing desk with another chair nightstand and a sink with cabinet and mirror  Loved the chandelier touch to the room  The bathroom was outside the bedroom   Seemed like brand new fixtures too  Staff was very friendly and accommodating  Bfast was okay if you wanted pastriestoast  But you could ask to keep some of your own foods in their fridge  Of course they had lots of coffee and a wide variety of teas  Even though the hotel was full most nights I would have never had known as it was very quiet  Location was perfect as well  I could easily get to the Metro stations or walk to various attractions  Id definitely stay here at my next visit to Montreal  
N => A wonderful place to stay  
N => Clean Close to Rue St Denis  
N => We love Chateau LArgoat   
N => Terrible Customer Service We stayed in Montreal at the Chateau Versailles over the y th weekend  The hotel is clean and nice and has an old world charm After we checked out and returned home we got an additional bill for  dollars  When we called to check on it the Manager told us that we drank  bottle of red wine  Bailleys and some other assortment of liquor from the room It was unbelievable My husband and I do not drink and to be charged for this was ridiculous  We tried explaining it  but the guy was so rude and refused to listen  He even claimed to have found the quotbottlesquot in the trash There is no way we can prove it  Looks like whoever came in to clean the room after we checked out must have swiped the drinks It was unpleasant and very unfair that we have to pay for something we never used I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  SInce you dont want to go home after your trip to hear that you need to pay extra for somethig you never used 
N => Nice base for touring Montreal I stayed  nights Wed Sat at the Chateau Versailles in il  after finding a rate of night plus taxes through another website  The location was very convenient for exploring Montreal   easy to walk to other neighborhoods or to metro which is only  blocks away  I had requested early check in prior to arrival and was pleased that my room was ready when I checked in at am  A little disappointed to have a lower level room but expected it due to the rate I got  The room itself faced Sherbrooke St  and had large windows which let in ample daylight  Was concerned about noise from street but had no issues sleeping as traffic foot amp auto drops off dramatically at night  The continental breakfast was good and is included in the room rate  All staff I encountered were friendly and able to help with any questions  Another plus   the hotel is serviced by the LAerobus airport shuttle which made my transport from and back to the airport easy  
N => A Wonderful Experience We have just come back from our three night four day visit to Montreal  Our stay at this charming place was a truly wonderful experience  EYES   this is a charming old block of four houses reated inside to connect the houses into one connected area  The architectural style was beautiful throughout including the rooms tastefully painted and pleasing to the eyes  The rooms were not large but our goal was not really to lounge around but rather to spend as much time sight seeing  The bathroom was well appointed and luxuriously clean although also not very large  There was no elevator and even though we stayed on the top floor we did not mind the stairs  We also felt that the carpet needed to be replaced  The break fast was just a fabulous experience a ent selection of cereals delicious hams and cheeses excellent quality jams pastries juice and some other items were more than than enough to please the discriminating guest and to prepare you for the daily quotgrindquot of touring the city  EARS   this fantastic breakfast feast was situated in a truly charming little salon quotLe Boudoirquot where classical music played in the background tastefully accompanying our gastronomic experience  The whole or and furniture also served the function of maintaining the level of intimacy we could actually quothearquot adding to the feeling of being constantly pampered  One of the hotel supervisors M Hom re Hugo was there at our last breakfast to make us feel more at home by offering some pleasantries with his sincere and friendly manner  As guests we appreciated and very much enjoyed this personal touch  M Hugo did not only have a pleasant manner more than that his way of conversing with us was welcoming warm and sincere rather than conducted in the function of quotdoing a job to please guestsquot TOUCH   all the hotel staff clearly had one goal in mind to do whatever is necessary to help us feel welcome and enjoy our stay  We were impressed by their dedication and attention to detail in all situations from offering advice as to where the quotbest quot of something was to explaining on the ma how to get there to making a reservation at a local restaurant  When we arrived went to our room and noticed a discernible amount of noise from an air conditioning unit we were offered a choice between two other rooms without a single question or hitch  Although the bed was comfortable my personal taste would have preferred a memory foam or pillow top type mattress  BRAVO to ALL the staff   we shall be back 
N => Not so charming Billed as so charming   which means long steep staircase to the entrance and no elevators I guess  This was quite a problem and a bad surprise  The room was very cute but small  For an old building the modernized bath was nice  Had a problem with the TV like to catch the stock activity when ket opens  A maintenance man sent up informed me some of the equipment was missing  This tells me rooms are rented without going over a checklist of does everything work  It could not be fixed before my departure  A complaint to the desk the next morn elicited sorry for the inconvenience my least favorite response  Wireless is extra in this hotel  Breakfast was terrific  A lovely room with lots of healthful choices  Then down those steep stairs to go  
N =>  stars Chateau Versailles was the best place we ve been in our trip to Canada  I was expected a regular hotel but they surprised me with a extremely upscale place but not saucy  Just loved it Great location great staff and a incredible bed Our room was downstairs very spacious and confortable Breakfast was perfect small served in a classic style room  Normally I wouldn t choose this kind of place because we are young and like modern touches now I am so happy I did  
N => Nice Hotel   Smallish rooms and No Elevators We recently stayed there during a business trip The hotel is in a good location   especially if you dont have a car  Lots for places to walk to shopping and restaurants The staff was helpful and informative when we asked them for guidance The room we were given was on the th floor   which is their top floor  The room was small but well appointed  They dont have elevators so that was a bit of a hassle especially after a day of hiking or walking around old town  The room was small but it had everything we needed They served a nice breakfast in the mornings with enough variety to keep most people happy They dont have a restaurant on site but they are right across the street from their sister hotel Meridian and there are lots of restaurants within a  min walk  Very close to a metro stop If we were to stay there again I would request a room on the lower floors   
N => wonderful hotel experience in lovely city We stayed two nights in y  We were traveling with a second couple  We had a wonderful hotel experience in a lovely city It began with a pleasant greeting and efficient check in by a super staff  Their experience showed in their efforts to make our visit special  We felt like guests  The rooms were well laid out and spotless  The bed was comfortable and linens were soft  The desk staff provided assistance on local sights and restaurants  The rainy weather even provided them with an opportunity to lend umbrellas  A continental breakfast was included  It was a delightful way to start each day  While the breakfast room was small a helpful staff member cleared areas quickly when they were empty  When we were leaving the staff made us feel as though we would be missed  I will certainly use the Chateau Versailles on our next visit to Montreal  
N => Lovely little hotel I just took my first ever totally solo pleasure trip and chose Montreal and the Chateau Versailles  It was the perfect choice    absolutely lovely and very comfortable  My room was very small but as I was alone this suited me fine  It was orated in wonderfully rich colors and the linens were beautiful  The hotel staff was exceedingly helpful and polite    front desk staffers maids breakfast attendant bellmen    all could not have been nicer  I also found the hotels location to be ideal  Its on a main street just two blocks from a Metro stop but still relatively quiet  The breakfast was continental meaning nothing fancy but ample very nicely presented and tasty  The only slight issue I had was an occasional odd smell almost like sweat in the bathroom  I think I isolated it to the shower curtain and I could have asked for a new one but it wasnt a big deal  I would absolutely return to this hotel on my next trip to Montreal  
N => Dont stay on level  We purchased a trip to Montreal on a website  We were scheduled to be in a STANDARD room  This room includes a DOUBLE bed rather than Queen or King  The room offered to us was also in the basement   st floor   and it was kind of a cave like feeling  We requested a move and for  more a night we were given a King room with fireplace  The bathrooms at this hotel are rather small would be uncomfortable for  people  Our second room was lovely and the breakfast was nice   although there is not always enough seating  The staff was quite good  
N => Convenient pleasant clean We stayed at ChV  on our recent long weekend trip to Montreal  We found the hotel to be conveniently located on upscale Sherbrook St  steps from museums restaurants and shopping  Old Montral Latin Quarter and Plateau are quite a bit farther but Its only a couple of blocks to the Metro The Hotel is clean  Our room was not big but comfortable and was nicely equiped  Central heating didnt work was turned off according to the front desk despite the fact that the overnight temprature was  Celsius Corridors were heated but not the rooms  We were however promptly given a space heater and extra blankets  The bathroom was clean high averageBreakfast consists of an average continental buffet adequate though nothing exciting to write home about The staff was helpful and pleasant I would stay here again   probably in a larger room though  
N => Wonderful This was our honeymoon and my husband and I both loved it  Not only were the rooms and the entire hotel clean and well orated but the staff was all very friendly and helpful  Furthermore it was only a short walk from museums and great shopping plus a Metro station so it was beyond easy to find exciting things to do everyday  I would return in a heartbeat 
N => PERFECT Quiet  This was our first trip to Montreal and our first to use Tripadvisor to help us select a hotel  I found the personal reviews of this hotel to be invaluable and hope our experience will help others The hotel was very nice and what I expected  Very quiet out of the busy hotel sections but close to so much It was clean no offensive odors and nicely orated  Our room was a little small but thats more because we booked at the last minute and didnt want to pay a lot  I know there were other rooms that were much more spacious  The staff was very friendly and accommodating  Our pillows were a bit lofty but we both fell asleep no problem  The breakfast the next morning was excellent Everything from fruit to some hard boiled eggs It was great Loved the bathrobes tooWe had a little situation with the Valet parking but they were very accommodating and offered a great solution  You see our driver side window button broke a few days before our trip  With no time to get it fixed we taped the button in a quotlockedquot position but if you happened to hit the button the window would go down but not back up  Well we forgot to tell them about that   kinda figured theyd see the piece of tape on the button and figure it out  Anyway they unrolled the window to enter the parking garage but then couldnt get the window back up  Not too secure huh When we returned from dinner they told us what happened  They offered to move our car out of the garage and into their own lot next to the security camera and watch it all night for us  So there our car sat window down all night under the watchful eye of the camera and staff member  It was a great solution  The next morning my husband and a staff member were able to get the window back up but they also took off the valet parking fee That was totally unexpected since it really wasnt their fault  How were they to knowWe ate at  restaurants that I wanted to comment about  Moisers on St  Laurent  The concierge at Le Meridan suggested it for meat lovers  Its a very very expensive steakhouse  There were many locals many families  renditions of Happy Birthday and children  If you dont want to be around kids because you left them at home like we did   this  not be the right place  Everything is a la carte so a meal for  without drinks was   We split a plate of asparagus and you could easily do that too  Also there was not much style there  My plate arrived with a hunk of meat on it  Nothing else  I was not impressed  We should have looked at the menu before being seated  The other restaurant was Stashs in Old Montreal  Wonderful Polish food very talented piano player if you happen to catch him and great atmosphere  A little more reasonable    with drinks We also found a great place to park in Old Montreal for free Yes free on Sat and Sunday only  It was on Rue St  Henri  If the river is at your back the street is way to the left  It was great to park there and walk around all day in Old Montreal  And yes the window was upWe loved the city loved the hotel wouldnt recommend Moishers but would definitely tell you to try Stashs 
N => Paradise by the basement lights We stayed in this hotel over a year ago  Only recently did I discover tripadvisor website  We found a special on the internet which we paid  American dollars a night  I was quick to book this room since the hotel website was considerably more expensive  I guess the adage you get what you pay for was applicable to our stay  I was very apprehensive when heading to our room when realizing that we were taking steps to a basement Obviously there were no overhead pipes or concrete steps no Freddie Kruger elements  All was done very tastefully with nice lighting and carpet  Upon opening the door to our room I was impressed by the large size of the room and the elegant or  However our windows were up high like the basement of my parents split level home  Remember on the television show Laverne and Shirley how they looked up and out their windows at pedestrians legs walking by Kinda like that Positives One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in  Top quality linens  Beautiful bathroom with granite  Comfy heavy duty robes  Excellent location which puts you in the heart of everything  despite facing the street rooms were quiet and I never heard noise from any other rooms  Nice breakfast Negatives Well there was the basement factor which was dark and distracted from many of the luxuries i e  nice high quality or  Staff was friendly but not terribly helpful  Whenever we would ask a question so simple as directions to a restaurant the staff would inform us that we needed to speak with concierge across the street at Hotel Versialles  The most basic and rudimentary inquires were referred to the concierge  Believe me I do not have concierge issues I just did not want to have to cross one of Montreals busiest streets to obtain any answersI gave Chateau Versialles  stars because Of price and location  I would have been livid if I paid full price for this accomodation  It has definately made me more aware and cautious when using disounted bookings   
N => Old world charm updated   
N => great experience  
N => Nice but hot even in the dead of winter  
N => Nice but Hot  
N => Cannot fault this hotel for comfort or value  Our experience here was excellent  We spent a week here our first visit to Montreal and Canada on the th floor in a very nicely furnished and coordinated suite with a fully equipped kitchen a sizeable suite with dining area and a big balcony with a fantastic view towards Mont Royal  It was nice to have the kitchen facilities for breakfast or supper  The room was high enough to escape any traffic noise but its not too busy a thoroughfare anyway  Close to a metro station too which is handy  The rooms are well insulated for sound   we never heard the neighbours even though they had a baby with them The laundry facilities in the basement are absolutely fine cheap and easy to use too  We found the service to be faultless and friendly too the front desk staff were very helpful  The place was spotless  We think that the people who have submitted poorer reviews must just have been unlucky  We know a good hotel when we see it as we travel extensively in Europe  We were comfortable and happy here and would try to book here again when we return to Montreal which we certainly will  This hotel contributed to a brilliant holiday in Montreal  
N => Worst hotel and service ever    especially for honeymooners My wife and I ided to come to Montreal for our honeymoon to keep our Canadian dollars where they belong but have it seem like we were in another country with the French lange    We chose the Clarion because in the photos and description it looked wonderful Well I have you know the photos are NOTHING to what they are cracked up to be    Our  day honeymoon turned into a  night stay and we had to get out  We had a dear friendhotel agent set everything up for us   It was to be a honeymoon suite all jazzed up with roses and wine and the whole nine yards   Upon our arrival they didnt have a room ready for us until the NEXT night so we settled for less at our expense   The next morning we told front desk we were ready to check out and check back in for our quothoneymoon suitequot in which he replied quotyou dont just want to keep the same roomquot    I thought it must have been a joke but after some words were exchanged we got our upgrade which was planned to begin with    This room was a so nice and big and fancy but ofcourse there was no roses and wine and everything as ordered  Being the romantic I am I ided to prepare for a meal that I would make for my new wife in the kitchenette included with the room    Every dish or utensil had food caked all over it It is the clients responsibility to keep the kitchenette cleaned to prevent a  fee but its evident that the cleaners dont do their job I immediately took it to front desk and they didnt have time to replace it because they only ever have one person working at a time   So she called a handy man of some sort   he came to our room and said quotI really have no time for this youre just gonna have to clean them yourselfquot    I thought for sure this must be a joke but yet again we had to exachange some words and we eventually got clean dishes   I dont know what they do to the employees at this hotel but they are the most miserable inconsiderate people I have ever encountered in customer service   I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I hope if this hasnt changed your mind about Clarion that you enjoy your time 
N => Great location It doesnt take alot for me to be happy with a hotel  I bascially like a good price great location and cleanliness  I travel with the idea that Im there to see the city and the hotel is just a place to sleep in  That said I was impressed with the Clarion despite reading bad reviews  Most places around are within walking distance  Room was clean free internet was great kitchen was a nice plus  Would definitely stay here again  Only bad thing for me was the hot tub was under construction during my stay which was disappointing  You definitely do not need a car when visiting Montreal  
N => never ever ever again This hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  The balcony door fell off the track and onto the balcony when I tried to open it  The concierge moved us to a suite which was just a bigger version of our ugly old room  The bathrooms are extremely tiny with no room to move  The other people staying in the hotel were loud rude and slamming doors all night  The night concierge was EXTREMELY unhelpful  This hotel over  sold their parking garage leaving my business partner and I stranded in montreal with nowhere to park our car at  in the morning  We complained only to be told quot there was nothing they could doquotNot finding parking until  in the morning was an awful end to an awful stay in the Clarion  I would not recommend this hotel to anybody  
N => Horrible experience I stayed at this hotel with another couple  I WAS HORRIFIED WITH THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD After we were refunded for our room because of our experience THE MANAGER CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD THREE  TIMES OVER   WITHOUT MY PERMISSION Our experience included dirty soiled underwear in the lobby washroom  minute wait for elevators dirty bed sheets a manager who said they would call me back then dodged my calls for   going on three weeks now  noise complaints dirty hot tub no parking a general manager who wouldnt listen to our complaints and was more interested in charging my credit card illegally    DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL  YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY It totally ruined our Montreal experience and one month later I am still trying to get this sorted with lawyers my credit card company and the GM who is a flake  
N => This hotel is awful   dont even consider staying here This past weekend I had the misfortune of staying at the Clarion Hotel at  de Maisonneuve Montreal QC  My experience was so terrible I believe that it is important for other travellers to be aware of the horrible conditions I experienced and the incompetent staff I had to deal with during my stay I had booked a room with two double beds for four travellers  Upon arrival I discovered that I was given a room with one double bed  I complained to the clerk at front desk who was unconcerned at first and told me that there was little he could and that I could lodge a formal complaint in the morning  I had to tell him that this was unacceptable and I demanded that I be given the room I reserved so that there would be enough space for everyone to sleep  He finally agreed to call the manager and asked us to wait in the current   but too small room Unfortunately when we were waiting we discovered that the room we were given was not only too small but also did not have electricity  After calling front desk someone from maintenance came to the room  We tried to explain the problem but he could not speak either French or English  After flipping the light switches he mumbled  no power me back  shrugged his shoulders  He left and didn t come back  We complained again to no avail  After sitting in the dark for about an hour we were finally given a new room  This room did not have two double beds but it had a bed and a sofa bed and was apparently the last room available in the hotel  Conceding that it was better than a single bed we agreed to take it for the night When we arrived in the room it was filthy musty and stinky  The walls had grime on it the floor had chip crumbs the sheets had holes there were no pillows and the bathroom was mouldy and in disrepair  The sofa bed had no support and it was more comfortable to put the mattress on the floor  Since it was all that was available we made due and had an uncomfortable night The next day we complained again and changed to a new room that actually had two double beds was fairly clean and did not smell  Unfortunately it did not have face cloths and when we asked for them they never came  We called three times to get face cloths but our request was ignored  Finally an hour and a half later someone came with a bath towel  But they could not speak English or French and did not understand us when we said that it wasn t what we needed When I checked out the next day I had to wait an hour since the hotel staff was slow and did not have an automatic check out system like most major hotels use  Regardless we needed to talk to the staff because there was a card in the room that stated that if we were not satisfied with our stay we were entitled to a free night stay  When I finally got to check out I asked the clerk for the discount and he LHED AT ME We spoke to the manager who didn t take our complaints seriously but offered us  off our bill anyway  We were so upset we just took the small discount that was offered and left so that we could be rid of the horrible experience and bad treatment The Clarion Hotel was by far the worst hotel I ve ever stayed at and I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone stay at this hotel unless they want to ruin their stay in the beautiful city of Montreal  
N => Great deal   Recommend it I was last minute making reservations TripAdvisor was a big help but I ran into too many not availables so I asked AAA to find something and they got me a reservation at the Clarion Hotel amp Suites  We had a great room   a suite for only  CAD  night   with queen size bed living room with pull out sofa my  year old son was travelling with me so that gave us each a little privacy  TVs ently equipped kitchen bathroom and kitchen table area  We were on the th floor which had awesome views from both the living room and the bedroom with windows that opened I read in Trip Advisor that we  not get parking in the garage and that turned out to be true  We wanted to park indoors since my dhters stuff had to stay in the car a few days so we parked at the Pepsi Forum only  blocks away  It worked out great You could park right out front for  min  to unloadload  Parking is not good anywhere in Montreal in my experience   neither inexpensive roomy nor easy to access  I recommend the higher floors because of the elevators  We did have to wait for an elevator going up but never going down but we did pass by the lower floors where people couldnt get on because it was already full  My key needed to be replaced but that did not turn out to be much of an inconvenience at all  Only other downside the internet service was not reliable But if you are on a budget not in a hurry and want to enjoy Montreal I highly recommend it Its near shopping movies groceries metro and restaurants In the last  years this is the rd hotel Ive stayed in downtown and my favorite so far 
N => Stay away We ided to stay at Clarion because it generally enjoys a good reputation and was close to many of the attrations we wanted to visit  Upon arrival we found that they charged a  security deposit that was not advertised on the webiste also night for parking that was not advertised  The parking was in an undergroud lot that barely accommodated the size of our Jeep Liberty  There was not enough room to pass another car in the garage so you just held your breath and hoped you would not meet another car on the way  Breakfast was not included in the price of the room unless you bought a quotspecial packagequot then the breakdown of room charges showed  each for breakfast that included  small eggs  undercooked strips of bacon or sausage two pieces of toast and a tiny glass of orange juice  The room itself was relatively clean but on the shelf in the coat closet we found shirt that belonged to a former occupant sitting on a few layers of dust  The bed was hard and they only had feather pillows a nighte for  people who suffer from allergies  Most hotels today include free local calls so we made a few over the time we stayed and on checkout found that they charge  for every call  also not advertised  Two elevators for  floors meant a wait every time you wanted to use one  The front desk girls were less than helpful and barely spoke English we had difficutly getting them to understand most of what we were saying  Overall I would no go back here  There were many hotels all around pick one of them  
N => Do NOT stay here My wife and stayed at this hotel on Sunday ust  to get things started we are both very familiar with Montreal and have stayed at dozens of hotels in Montreal  Seeing that our trip was coming to an end and we wanted to break our drive up a bit we ided to stay the night in Montreal and head home the next day    We didnt have access to the internet but I always keep hotels ca number handy on my cell  We called them and booked a somewhat cheap hotel  for a sunday night as we didnt want to spent too much money hotels ca rated the hotel a  star so we figured we were safe geez was I wrong as soon as we checked in my wife ided she did want to stay here so we tried to check out right away  Which was impossible without losing  somewhat understandable  The staff was pretty good to us and offered us a different room on higher floor which was a bit cleaner but still digusting  I will never stay at this hotel again for the following reasonsLocation although it isnt that far from the action the area doesnt seem the safestRooms are so outdated and dirty I wouldnt let my  brother stay there even to party Elevators seem like they havent been serviced since the hotel was built and there is only  for  floors        minute waitParking dont even bother parking your car there If i could give this hotel a minus rating I would  Stay at the Four Points or Delta  more a night but a world of difference 
N => Absolutely disgusting Absolutely Disgusting   Jon   TodayI have never seen such a fiasco in my life  We booked and had written confirmation for two rooms for il   the Saturday night of the UFC   Upon our arrival we discovered that the hotel was majorly over booked  They had up to  reservations per room  The first people to arrive were given their room only to go out for a few hours and return to find their keys no longer worked and someone else was in their room  Other less fortunates like ourselves were just left with no room and absolutely no where to stay in Montreal  The staff didnt even bother to try to locate another hotel for these people  We were just screwed and left to drive back to Toronto after the fight  Too bad the worst rating you can give this hotel is poor  
N => I would warn all away from this hotel This WAS a nice hotel years ago called the Manoir LeMoyne  It seems that Clarion has taken it over and driven it down into nothing more that a dump with drug users yelling all through the night Rather than write out a terribly long narrative here is a long list of why we wont go backSmall bathroomFan did not workShower door not attached properlyDrawers did not open and close properlyHair dryer did not operate for more than  minute alternate I had blew circuitKitchenDrawers did not open and close properlyDishes were dirty in the cupboardMain AreaAir vents were filthyWallpaper peeling with moldy looking walls behindDining area chair torn and frayedSofa and chair stainedLarge BathroomDoor did not functionVery low water pressureSpa jets did not workI have to agree wholeheartedly with the negative reviews Oh and this was the quotPresidential Suitequot  We needed more beds and thought it would be a nice splurge  They wanted night  
N => The worst experience of my life Checking into the Clarion proved to be a nighte  The staff was too incompetent to enter my credit card properly which was refused  She was asking me all kind of question about my bank account which I thought were strange but I was under shock as I have a new card with a high limit  I asked to use their phone as I assured her there was a mistake  She refused told me to use a pay phone  Here I was stranded with my  dhters  kms from home and was treated like a thief and a third class citizen  I paid cash for the room and in my car called the bank from my cell  The bank informed me that they never tried to withdraw money and after hearing my story told me they breeched confidentiality I will have to cancell and have a new card as the questions the hotel were asking are highly suspicious  After TRYING to relay this to the hotel and asking them to call the bank I was blatantely accused of being a liar  I asked for my money back without taking a supervisor name to contact the next day  Got my money back WENT TO DOUBLE TREE HOTEL  CARD WORKED PERFECTLY AND STAFF WAS AMAZING  
N => Give this place a pass  We stayed at this hotel for a week so I can speak from experience  How it got a rating of  stars is beyond me it is a   in my opinion  This is the first time that I have ever rated a hotel but your website has been so helpful to me in picking hotels since my expericne that I feel compelled to contribute  Although we booked for a week we were offered one of the worst rooms in the place  in bad repair looking like it had not been reated or maintained since the severnties  Only when a number of things including the plumbing did not work and the hotel was not inclined to fix it were we moved to a better looking but still poorly maintained room  Our new room had an ancient unreated sub standard kitchen lacking essential equipmeht  for example it had an oven but no ovenprrof pans or dishes  When we asked the hotel how we could use the oven without pans we were told that they were not supplied  The plumbing is old and poorly maintained requiring frequent calls to maiteance  When they cleaned the rooms they frequently did not leave toilet paper or adequate towels requiring more calls  The staff were stiffly polite but dismissive  it is clear that they were not allowed to do anything or spend any money to keep the hotel in an adequate state of repair or offer adequate customer service  The elevator service is slow and inadequate  We were forced to wait forever for an elevator only to find it occupied by cleaning staff and cleaning equipment  If you are thinking of staying here give it a pass  It could ruin your holiday  
N => Extremely disappointing stay   not recommended This is my first time Ive felt compelled to give a quotterriblequot rating to a hotel but I feel its well deserved  Lets start at the beginning A little haggard after a long journey I went to check in  The front desk staff were busy talking to one another and even when they acknowledged me they continued to talk to one another and do other things while checking me in  Quite rude and the first time Ive ever had his happen to me  They required a weeks deposit I was staying for  days which is also unusual Im used to a weeks pre authorization not a weeks withdrawal Then I went to park  The parking is located down a back alley with lots of graffiti and I could understand if some people felt scared in that location  The parking lot itself consists of three floors underground with only one lane throughout for both directions to share and sharp turns that often require a reversal for larger vehicles  As a driver you re constantly afraid you ll encounter someone else not in a spot After parking I went to my room   it was a smoking room  I had specifically asked for a non smoking room due to my Asthma  The front desk told me no other rooms were available but one magically appeared when I said I d have to check out then The room itself was laid out oddly   high fashion for the seventies I suppose  The kitchen was complete with stove missing a knob for the oven Fridge with horrible smell in the freezer and microwave  The bathtub didn t drain  The bed was horribly uncomfortable   I like a firm mattress but this mattress was hard and bumpy it felt more like sleeping on a blanket placed on a rock  The chesterfield in the living room had broken springs that while concealed behind the fabric dug into you while seated All of these issues were reported to the hotel except for the bed I figure they are probably all the same mattress  it seems new  and the only things they successfully repaired were the tub it now takes  minutes to drain and the knob on the oven  They tried to fix the freezer but failed and didn t even come back to check everything was OK They did give a veneer of service and concern when issues were brought up though overall their ability to fix them was poor  Sadly this will have to be the first hotel I put on our company s black list  I m leaving tomorrow when a room at l Appartement becomes available There is a hot tub sauna and an exercise room with a universal gym old and a few aerobic machines  Certainly nothing to write home about If you do choose to go here despite my warnings I wish you luck  
N => Did not like this hotel Had booked  nights at this hotel  Could not find the parking garage so had to park on a side street and walk two blocks  Neighborhood is not the best and very run down When I finally was able to book in the gentleman behind the desk was very helpful  The parking garage is behind the hotel down this garbage strewn alley and into this very small underground garage that only one car at a time can either go in or out of  Our quotior suitequot on the th floor was small  Two double beds with worn material on the table chairs carpet was looking pretty worn  Small kitchen area but bathroom was nice  Our window overlooked the garbage strewn alley in the back  The worst part of this hotel was that when coming onto your floor all you could smell was the meals that people were cooking in their rooms and this night it smelled like fish was on the menu  The smell was very overpowering The air conditioner was very loud and when we were just falling asleep it would bang and clamor on with such a loud noise that we jumped out of bed not knowing what all the commotion was The next morning we checked out and went to another hotel in Old Montreal  The price of   canadian was not worth it  Spent the rest of our vacation  nights in a beautiful hotel in Old Montreal for  more and it was a difference of night and day  
N => not great  
N => good value acceptable hotel  
N => Service was good but a lot left to be desired  
N => Not bad stayed at better  
N => Problems but they were taken care of  
N => il y a du bon et du moins bon     
N => not to be remembered we spent there just one night  we were lucky as we got a parking place the neighborhood wasnt the best you can think of the room was average large enough for  peoplequotstrangequot people in the area we felt unconfortable coming back after dinnerbreakfast nothing to write homehot breakfast    we had some fruit and coffee even no cereal for the girls  
N => Great Experience  Great staff  Delightful continental breakfast  Close to the Metro and buses Food court on street level one block away  Would go back anytime  We highly recommend this as an alternative to the  hotels around the corner  A bargain in every way  
N => Full of discrepancies DISCREPANCY   Price    I booked this hotel online for a Sat stay I was not aware it was the Gay Pride Weekend  On the hotels own website CAA rate for  adults doubles was   Each additional adultchild was   Yet I booked via Hotels ca it was  for  adults amp  children  Normally you would get a lower price by booking with the hotel directly  DISCREPANCY   PARKING    Some reviews mentioned the property offered limited free parking on a first come first serve basis  Yet on the hotels own website it states day  Because of road closures in nearby areas for the special event it took me an hour to drive from Old Montreal to the hotel at  pm  I thought I was fortunate to find a parking spot in the lot  Upon check in I was told the lot was full and I must park elsewhere   so I guessed it was first come first serve pay parking  DISCREPANCY   BREAKFAST    Some reviews mentioned the breakfast was rationed  Upon check in I was given breakfast ticketvoucher for each room occupant  The next morning there was nobody quotpatrollingquot which meant all you can eat  However the breakfast was inadequate just as everyone wrote Our room size was good but the carpet seemed dirty  Although there was a street concert one block away till  pm our room was in the middle of property and the noisy was tolerable  I probably would stay in a suburban hotel next time 
N => Worst Hotel Experience   Ever  I booked a two day stay commencing  at the Comfort Hotel and Suites Downtown Montr al CN The disappointment started at check in with a front desk clerk who had no concept whatsoever of the meaning of customer service  He almost did us a favour by checking us in The room itself while large enough and comfortable enough did not  feel  clean   it felt grubby The parking for which we paid extra was inadequate as to room to park or maneuver to come and go other card had to be jockeyed around and we had to drive over a curb On our first full day by  pm our room had not been made up  The front desk clerk the one we previously met said there was nothing he could do about it  The maid had a schedule and when she gets to it she gets to it The free breakfast was so inadequate that we left and ate elsewhere  All we really wanted was cereal and coffee af and even those items were not available We picked this location because of its proximity to the Just for Lhs Festival and knew it was not a four star hotel but didn t really think it would be as bad as it was I am telling you all this because I feel this particular hotel downgrades your entire brand  I know I will have to thin hard and long before booking a  Choice  brand again  
N => Satisfactory    but it helped that I had lowered expectations My partner booked the hotel through Orbitz so she had paid by the time I found out about it and when I read the reviews here I was prepared for a bad experience It wasnt bad  It was fine  Not great but we didnt pay for great The hotel is understaffed but thats what probably saved money  I felt worse for the poor harried staff members than for any of us hotel guests who had a long wait for check in  The rooms are small but ok and we were lucky enough not to be on the side with the idling busses  The place was adequately maintained    not super clean but not a mess either  Fortunately no bugs in sight and I was looking for them We were satisfied  
N => Better than expected The room was clean and spacious with all necessities  Breakfast was very quotbasicquot   nothing to write home about  The beds were wide but strangely short  Free parking was full so we parked a block away for  a day which was not a big dill except we could not pay for  day and had to pay every  hours  At least there were no bugs and buses did not really bother us at night  And location was really great 
N => Bugs Noise and No Heat Stayed here once in tember not luxurious but cheap so we booked another night last weekend      Second time was terrible  Slow check in could not find reservation for group of five in front of us although they had receipt  Half hour later could not get our credit card to work asked if we would pay cash I will be sure to check that I was not double billed   No heat desk confirmed we had done all correctly  Offered to change rooms which we lined  Thermostat was at  heat went from  to  degrees overnight   Woke to bed bugs crawling on pillow   Overnight was noisy with busses backing up in bus terminal next door  Party people had three rooms on same floor and slammed doors and yelled most of the night   Room  had a window that was cut from a plastic directional sign held in place with duct tape    Shower drain was plugged we had water over our ankles in tub   Told at check in that breakfast was served until  am arrived at  to find it closed since    Caution Parking is free but first come first served good luck if you come in at  or  am and find it full Will not be back 
N => Mmmmm those nice little bed bugs   STAY AWAY from this hotel   I went there for a business trip and booked this hotel because couldnt find another one they were all full  I had seen a previous review written in ember  about a bedbug problem but thought quothey  year after they couldnt be in business if the bug were still a problem    quot Well I was wrong  I first found  really small bugs on my pillow  I just swepped them away and inspected the matress shaking the sheets didnt seem to be others so i ided to give it a try  While watching TV around h I saw another bug coming towards me  I pulled off the sheets and was grossed out to see there were plenty of little bugs some really bigger than those I saw before all crawling around I took my luggage and went to the lobby explained to the young guy that I wanted refund  It was now midnight  After looking at the bugs himself he offered me another room   NO THANKSI had to find another hotel found it  km away got asleep at h and spent the next day thinking there were still bugs in my clothes    Dont try this hotel  
N => Worth what you pay for I stayed at the Taj Mahal hotel about  years ago for  days and I thought it was good hotel for its price  Since I arrived in Montreal by bus from Quebec City I was able to walk to the hotel right after I got off the bus thus saving the cab money Although there was no breakfest included in the price they offered free high speed Wi Fi internet in the room which was definetely useful The lady at the reception was very kind to give information about the city and help with any sort of problems when I arrived the AC in the room was not working but they sent somebody to fix it later in the day I see some people complaining about the noise from the buses but the room I stayed in was located in the part which is opposite from the bus station so there was no noise during the night  I thought the room was quite comfortable  Another plus was that the hotel was right next to a metro station I recommend this hotel for people who dont want to spend too much on lodging but still get a very ent service  
N => Dont Do Stay At Days Inn We were scheduled to check in at pm we called at  pm and told them we would be there at pm since it was mid day and we were downtown in Montreal  They said no problem we arrived and there was NO room available    we had to wait   even though we showed up at pm Place was dirty and like something out of a bad movie green carpet old furniture and terrible lighting  Like staying in a dirty dungeon  Days Inn downtown is only  more and more central This place is also close to the bus station where at least  homeless people hang up not safe to walk to at night  Also closer to the gay town not the good clean part of downtown montreal  Dont do it free advice    
N => If you like rude staff enjoy your stay Please read this review all the way through if you intend to drive to this hotel   it will be worth your time   I promise Basically do not waste your time with this hotel  It is located on the rough side of Montreal and if you like homeless people begging for change on your walk home because you shouldnt drive as this hotel has no where to park   more on that later    then this is really the quottaj mahalquot for youThe rooms were okay   basic accommodation nothing fancy    however the problem lies with its parking lot and staffing  Lets first start with the parking  If you do not look closely you might miss it Yes   there are only about  parking spots available for guests meanwhile there are over a hundred rooms available   you do the math  It is first come first serve   and luckily for us we got a parking spot After a late evening out to see the sights of Montreal we came back to the hotel in order to get the car to drive my local friend home  When we got back to the hotel there was another guests car illegally parked and blocking our car  We went to the front desk to explain the situation  The staff member stated that he was going to wake up that hotel guest this was at am and ask them to move their car  We suggested an alternative answer in hopes not to hassle the other guests but for the hotel to pay for a taxi to take my friend home which would have costed no more than   That was not a reasonable solution to the hotel staff member so he immediately proceeded to wake up the hotel guest and made him move his car   needless to say that that guest was not pleased whatsoever The front desk person provided the following answer quothe shouldnt have parked there anywayquot  Odd thing is should it not be the responsibility of the hotel staff to ensure that guests do not park in the lane ways that will block other guests from exiting in the first place so that this does not need to happen Common sense would dictate a yes answer but the Taj Mahal answer is a quotnoquot  In any case upon my return from dropping off my friend   the guest who had blocked me ended up parking in my original spot   so I was forced to park my car in the lane way  We explained this back to the front desk staff and he provided us with a dangle sign to place on our mirror like this was a common occurrance  We offered to leave the keys with the front desk so that they could move the vehicle but they did not want to take them At approximately am we received the nasty call to ask us to remove our vehicle which we promptly did as we understood the inconvenience it placed on others and witnessed it first hand  At the time of check out at am we proceeded to explain to the front desk lady of our upsetting experience and suggested that an apology andor a small discount of  or  dollars to offset the experience was in order  The front desk staff person proceeded to explain that it was our fault   that we should not have parked there and blocked others too Meanwhile the original point of the matter was to provide the feedback on the fact that they were not managing the parking lot properly to prevent this from happening When we continued to press and explain our point she said quotwhy dont you just shut upquot  At that point in time we realized that this staff member did not know the first thing about hotel hospitality and was obviously working in the wrong industry  She then told us to leave but then we stated we needed an invoice for the room and she just assumed that we booked through the internet without even checking her records and stated that she cannot give us an invoice if we booked online   which we did not  When we finally able to get our invoice she crumpled it up and threw it over onto the floor  Mind you this was all in front of other hotel guests If this is the type of hospitality you look for on your vacation stay the Taj Mahal is the perfect hotel for you  Otherwise steer clear away as the management of this hotel needs to address the very real concerns regarding their parking lot and more importantly their staff  
N => Great place We found the Taj Mahal about am after a bad experience in the St  andre Hotel  Everyone was great we checked into a room in  minutes the room was large a little dated but okay  The front desk workers were very helpful in giving directions and getting around  I would stay there again great price and walking distance to everything  
N => Taj Mahal is the Place to Stay My friends and I hit Montreal this past month and stayed at Hotel Taj Mahal  Our stay there was amazing The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and the location of the hotel was perfect  It was walking distance to all the spots in downtown plus the Metro station was two seconds away from the hotel  The hotel was reasonaly priced and was provided with clean rooms and efficient service  I would totally stay at Tah Mahal again Definately a prime place to stay if your going to Montreal anytime soon  
N => ent stay A friend of mine suggested staying at the Taj Mahal during my last visit to Montreal  After reading through previous comments froom this site though I told him of how skeptical I was of the Taj  But I gave him the benefit of the doubt  My friend had made me a reservation on the quiter st hubert side of the hotel which I liked  The carpets seemed new likely since I noticed reations in the works  The lobby was gorgeous Indian or was mystical  The staff was friendly and helpful  Since I had a credit card with me no  deposit was required  Must say was glad to have taken my friends advice  
N => Never again This Hotel was the worst I went to Acapulco on my grad trip and didnt expect that much  Compared to the Taj Mahal Mexico looked like a million dollar hotel  The staff was rude except for the girl at the front desk  The owner blocked my car from going into the parking garage when I arrived but never made me aware of why he was doing this   minutes later I was instructed to find my own parking because it was quotfirst come first servequot So I had to pay  at an outside parking lot to leave my car there for  nights   Then when I went to the owner and demanded I be reimbursed since parking is supposedly included in the price of the hotel  he rudely walked away from me as I was speaking  The room was disgusting  lamps only  lightbulb worked the sheets were dirty the door wouldnt close properly we had like  working television stations  were french no alarm clock and the carpets were disgusting  There were  girls in my room and we asked for  towels the owner refused and said we could only have  Can u Imagine This was the worst hotel I have ever been too NEVER AGAIN 
N => Mixed We had a good visit good food in hotel restaurant and reasonable  But my son dropped his autographed hat on the restaurant floor when we leftbeing a gentleman we require that he takes his hat off when eating  We called the hotel after three calls the hat was found I gave my credit card number and was assured it would be mailed to me  After two weeks and another phone call  i still hadnt received the hat But they assured me it would be sent soon as they had been very busy and hadnt been to mail it yet WEll  months later we went back to Taj Mahal Hotel thikning wed get the hat and stay there again Guess what  no hat to be found This is very bad business tha     room under Francis John  
N => not worth over a hundred C a night Hotel is not worth a hundred C a night  Needs new carpets lighting and fire safety procedures  The night we stayed a garbage fire started in a maids closet nd floor garbage should be taken out at night  Fire doors where all open so smoke was present throughtout hotel   dollars I would pay but no more  hotel does have potential  
N => HELL NO youve got to be kidding me  
N => A Shady Stay  
N => Not a highlight of Montreal  
N => Worst Hotel             
N => more of a motel than a hotel  
N => Worst Ever  
N => Taj Mahal   I think not  
N => the place to stay near the party district and spend as little as possible room  
N => Infestation de punaises de lit  
N => Fine for the money     My husband amp another couple headed up to Montreal for a quick weekend trip  nights Checked around with different search engines to find something under   only staying a night and a half   no luck in city the outgames going on had to book outside  Went thru hotwire  Rooms were ok for our needs    just a place to sleep   blocks from the bus station  Just be sure to request a non smoking room if you dont smoke  Even with the spray they gave us   it was overwheming  hotel booked up and no non smoking available  For the day and a half we were there is was ok but if staying any longer Id look for somewhere else Very basic hotel with limited cont  breakfast  
N => Very Clean We ided to stay there as they let us park our car while we were away for a week  Our flight was in the evening and they were able to extend our check out time from pm to pm  I like their complementary airport shuttle bus service  Our room was very clean and there were two soap bars and a small bottle of shampoo amp conditioner in the bathroom  Occasionally we saw airplanes flying in and out of the nearby airport Montr al Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport but we were not bothered by the sound at all  
N => Kids Loved It  This was our first time in Montreal and I was very much impressed by this hotel  We had a car to get around the city so the location was great for us and you couldnt even hear the airport at all my kids kept asking where the airport was thats how quite it was  Great price right off the highway mall closeby with East Side ios Mikes Restaurant and many others  Clean clean clean and new that was important to us  I didnt want to sleep in an old smokey hotel room so this hotel was perfect Pool was great salt water and exercise room with modern and working equipent amp tv  It overall left a great impression on our family and we would defintiely return  
N => Great airport hotel This is an extremely pleasant hotel with a quality feel to everything you touch  Now one year old it still feels as clean and polished as if it opened yesterday  Close by car to the airport although a twisty confusing route after you leave the main highway so study that map first Plenty of snack restaurants within walking distance  Double queen room very large and well appointed but with wired internet which frustratingly did not work for me seemed like broken DHCP server  Lobby area had excellent free wireless however  We stayed here on a Sunday night and pretty much had the place to ourselves so cant truly comment on noise but we never heard a thing   The construction looks solid enough to discourage disturbance from corridors or neighbouring rooms  Did not eat in restaurant but the bar although comfortable was as usual in hotels rather expensive Not much else to add to previous reviewers except to emphasise the friendliness of the staff who were great  We used their excellent free airport shuttle bus but had difficulty locating it at YUL  You have to exit the revolving door from arrivals onto the roadway then look for quotpostequot pickup point number  which did not appear to exist  What they forgot to tell me is that you have to cross the first line of postes entirely and you find another roadway this time including one numbered   
N => Unforgettable memories The day we went to Montreal the weather was horrible it was raining  Our bus arrived early and we were thankful that we were able to check in early  The staff was super nice  The hotel was clean the beds were soooo comfortable  Most of the time we spent was in hotel because of the weather but we didnt mind  Location was pretty good  Beautiful during the night time  We honestly enjoyed it 
N => Dont go there  We stayed at the iott for business  They put a group of students on party in the room next to us  We havent been able to sleep  Totally unacceptable from a four stars hotel  Even without that the room was very noisy  Also the room was small and the staff didnt look very serious  For about the same price its much better to go to the Delta Hotel just behind the iott  
N => Mediocre room and ok location Rooms were mediocre but fairly beaten up There was a bug in the bathroom  Also my wife and son woke up with several mysterious itchy bed bug bites The breakfast was not the best The front desk staff was OK The internet connection was intermittent We were able to walk from the hotel to the metro and to the downtown area I agree with the person who wrote an earlier review that said that the bulldozer would be the right next step for this property This was not up to the high typical standards of Courtyard riott  
N => Rude and Incompetent Staff My boyfriend took me to Montreal for a nice getaway  When he booked the hotel they told us that they were the closest riott Hotel near the gay village  They were not  Two other riott hotels were closer than this one When we checked into the hotel we specifically requested for a non smoking room  They told us that this was a non smoking hotel  However when we entered our room the rooms extremely musty  The previous tenants probably were smoking illegally in the room  We asked for a different room but were told that they were sold out  I have asthma and I had a very difficult time sleeping that night  The following morning I spoke with the manager on duty  He said that he would resolve the situation  When we came back to our room the following day the room still had that musty tobacco smell but this time I could smell the cheap Lysol they sprayed in the air trying to cover the smoke but it did not work whatsoever  I called downstairs to the front desk and they told me that the manager took care of the situation  I told them to come up and smell the room for themselves  We took a nap but no one ever came to investigate  When we went out later that evening I told the front desk about the room  He said that he would get someone to look at it  When we came back there was no difference The following day we checked out  I saw the manager on duty and I told him how disappointing our stay was  He said that he quotsprayedquot a cleanser in the air  I told him that it did not work  I also told him that someone was supposed to come and smell the room but no one showed up  He said that they were too busy  I guess they were too busy for guests that were not satisfied with their room This hotel has very poor services and we will not stay here again  I am very dissatisfied with this hotel  
N => it was okay but would not stay there again This was my th time to Montreal and my first and last time at this hotel  The lobby was pretty beat up  Rooms were dated  The bathtub would fill up with water when I had a show  And the hotel staff were pretty much invisible  When you have to take the elevator to your room you have to lift your suitcase up a  stairs before you can make it to the elevator  The food in the restaurant was overpriced  The location is okay but there is a newer holiday inn right next door and a four points right across the street  
N => Enjoyable Stay  I stayed here mid tember  with my wife and  year old son for the combined reason of business meetingvacation  I have to admit that I was very impressed by the very welcoming friendly and efficient staff  It was a little difficult to find because of construction downtown my unfamiliarity with Montreal and problems with our GPS unit   even with directions from AAA in hand  But once found it was clearly in the midst of things   a short   minute walk to the Palais des Congress Old Montreal and the Mont Royal Park  It was also a short  minute walk to the Metro  Parking for   canadian daily was available with unlimited inout privileges but honestly it was much easier to get around Montreal without a car The room was comfortable clean and well maintained  We had a nice view of the Mont Royal Park  There was a complimentary wireless internet connection  There was an indoor poolfitness center available for my family to use and although I was unable to use it I was told that it was adequate  There was a lifeguard available and the pool was closed when the lifeguard was off duty  am    pm which greatly limited the use of the pool Overall a pleasant experience and a very good value in comparison to other hotels in Montreal and other major cities  
N => Avoid  When I checked in the clerk tired to give me a higher room rate  I had different rates for the  days but the clerk adamantly said my rate was the higher rate for all  days  Even on her check in card the rate written correctly displaying what I was saying  Even after explaining to her she did not agree to the rate and went in another room and spoke to somebody and came with the same higher rate for all  days and now she had scratched the lower rate from her card  Thankfully I remembered that I had printed my hotel receipt at home and packed it  I had to fish that receipt out of my luggage  Finally only after showing that I got the rate that I was entitled to on the first place There is only Valet Parking at this hotel  On th   I went down to get breakfast around  am and saw my car parked in the lobby  I was concerned since I had not called my car the Valet brings the car to the front entrance at the request of the client  When I spoke to the concierge they brushed me saying it must be a mistake  I am skeptical though and wondering whether my car was being used illegally without my permission  
N => Good price We recently stayed at the Courtyard riott for a weekend  There was a half price deal with hotels com which made it worthwhile  Rooms very clean and reasonably large  Friendly and helpful staff  Full buffet breakfast was very nice and had a good selection of hot and cold items  Walking distance to old montreal as well as downtown shopping  I would def stay there again with the same deal   not entirely sure if I woul have been as happy had we paid full price for the room In room movies cost about  plus tax  They offer in room free wireless but the coverage was pretty poor   we only got  bar out of   Eventually managed to connect but took a while  
N => Great Experience I read some reviews that said this hotel was tired but when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find it immaculate and looking very fresh  I spent  nights in this hotel and have absolutely no complaints  The beds were comfortable the rooms big enough and everything was spotless We did have trouble getting through to room service one night but other than that everything was perfect  I would recommend this hotel highly  
N => Must have had a bad room Due to the mainly positive reviews the Courtyard has received as well as my general satisfaction with the riot brand I am willing to entertain the possibility that I just got a bad room  Room seemed old and dated  Not dirty but not that fresh and clean feel  Not old as in stately and victorian but old as in the Threes Company apartment  ent location one block from the subway but just not warm comfortable and welcoming like so many other Courtyards  If I return to Montreal I will book a room elsewhere  
N => The Friendly people and the clean streets of Montreal HiMe and my family just came from having a wonderful time in Montreal  We visited the oldest catholic church  The art gallory row  The Biosphere Botantical Gardens Observatory Tower the beach although man made was nice  The Fine Arts musem was awesome  We went to the jazz festival and was just blown away by the different types of music and dance We stayed at the Courtyard riott and was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews online but the hotel and staff was simply velous  Rene gave us suggestions on what to visit and direct directions on how to get there  He came by everyday to see how we had enjoyed where went and then would make suggestions for more places  All his suggestions were dead on the spot  I have not had such great customer service in a long time  The Courtyard staff are to be commend  The resturant food was excellent  We even enjoyed the swimming pool where our children placed co Polo  The rooms were clearn and roomy enough for the  of us  So I have no complaints about this hotel or its service  I would highly recommend this hotel to all We went to eggspectations and the food was delicous and homemade  The service again was awesome The people in Canadian were so very friendly  If you looked like you were lost someone would come over to help you If you ever visit Montreal  Look up Rene at the Courtyard riot you can not beat his customer service anywhere 
N => Great hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel for  nights in ember  It was more pleasant than expected  The room was clean location was great and the swimming pooljacuzzi on the top floor with a city view were a nice touch  The only problem was with parking since it does take valet about   minutes to bring the car up  But all we needed to do was call in ahead of time  Staff was very friendly  We would stay in this hotel again  
N => Just fine   
N => Would Go Back The hotel was all good with the service pool for my son amp even a bus stop right in front of the hotel But the only flaw was the menu for dinner amp supper time was not the best suited for children  
N => Excellent staff meeting every guests needs We checked in to our room with an adjoining door amp could hear nearly every word from the next room including the coughing fit a man was having  Immediately we called the front desk to get us another room  We were in our new room within  minutes  The rooms were beautifully orated without a flaw  Our room had plenty of space with a great view of the airport amp city lights   night  The halls were exceptionally quiet This is the quietest amp prettiest hotel stay I have had  Every question we had was answered quickly professionally amp was just the answer we wanted to hear  Great staff beautiful facility amp quiet halls Definitely worth many more stays 
N => Wonderful Experience Really enjoyed my stay  Beautiful new rooms and comfortable beds    The rooms have just been reated and iloved the plasma TVs  The staff was really friendly and helped to find things to do in the area in the evening  I really enjoyed my stay and will definately stay there again the next time I have to go to Montreal  
N => Feels more like a motel I stayed in this hotel over Labor Day weekend with some friends  Right away the lady at the check in counter was very rude The first room we got reeked of a foul odor we had to change our room  The new room was clean but the furniture looked like it was from the s and it felt like it too  The beds were very uncomfortable  They even forgot to clean my room one of the days The only good thing about the hotel is the location I booked this hotel from HOTWIRE  They sold it to me as a  star hotel which it definately was not They charged me over  per night  Overall this hotel is at best just okay  But definately feels more like a motel 
N => Not worth the price I booked this hotel over the hotwire  With tax and everything I paid  dollars and a sleepless night  After I got it I read the good reviews here  I was happy  But I was wrong  We had a terrible night  First of all we found that the beds were too old and smelly  Then the air conditioner oldschool jumbo fat one was too noisy  I turned it off but after a while the room got warmed up so we had to turn it on again with the loudy noise  There was a computer in the room but Internet stopped working in the morning  There was a hair dryer in the washroom but doest work at all  I complained  The receptionist was rude and completely non friendly  With this same price you will get a much better hotel  And the location was not that great as advertised  I bet you can stay at the downtown core with this same price  Don t stay here  
N => Days Inn Montreal Stayed here uary  for a weekend with friends to visit Montreal  It was okay  I really dont have any complaints about the place  The room was clean and acceptable  I would recommend  
N => Ok hotel Great price and location Great  queen room for  a night through Expedia Parking also great rate at  Room was plain but clean  Showing age however    Problem with room      carpet soaked from AC leaking onto floor  Staff not surprised      happens all the time in this hotel they said  Changed to quotremodeledquot newer room  Only change was room had hardwood floors Problem with staff         chambermaid knocked on our door at  am            asked me if we were checking out      I had a few words for her and shut the door        checkout was not until  am Complained to front desk about this       and they turned up their nose and said she does not know who has or hasnt checked out  Said I should have quotdo not disturbquot sign on door  Funny we were only booked in for one night so they knew we would be out in the morning Outdoor pool was clean and well keptLocation perfect for our needs     
N => Reasonable utilitarian hotel I was in Montreal for a conference at the Sheraton which was booked so I looked for a less expensive place nearby  This hotel a few hundred meters away worked out fine  Its not elegant but it was clean and comfortable  The location is great as other reviewers have noted just few blocks from dozens of restaurants and the Centre Bell  They have a computer in each room it runs some service that allows internet access  It was hard to figure out but once I got it to work it was fine and I didnt bother to get out my laptop  The French keyboard took some getting used to though The staff was polite enough  Overall I was happy with the hotel  At about half the price of the Sheraton I don t mind skipping a few amenities  
N => Watch out if you booked through Expedia I have been an avid reader of the reviews posted on this website but Ive never been inclined to actually post my own review  My husband and I recently returned from a trip to Quebec and had a lay over in Montreal for one night  I had booked the Days Inn   Metro on line via Expedia  Normally Expedia reserves the room for you then you actually pay at the hotel  In our case Expedia charged us right away We checked into our room at pm dropped our luggage off and quickly went down to the buffet to have a late dinner  I noticed that the carpet in the room hadnt been vacuumed but the beds were made Upon our return from dinner we had to use our bathroom and I couldnt believe the mess The bathroom counter and basin were dirty a heap of dirty towels were strewn in the tub and a waste basket filled with feminine hygiene products littered the bathroom I called the front desk to inform them of the condition of our room and they said that housekeeping had gone home for the night and there was nothing they could do about it  They could not give us another non smoking room because all rooms were occupied My husband had recently had a stroke and there was no way I was going to compromise his condition by going into a smoking room We were not allowed to speak to management however the next day we did have a conversation with a supervisor  She was unable to give us a discount on our room because we had booked through Expedia  Had we booked directly with the Days Inn then there was something they could do  We were supposed to return for another two nights at the end of the week but we quickly contacted Expedia to cancel  They were going to charge us  for a cancellation fee but waived this because of my husbands medical condition The hotel is in a good location and in general the room was OK but it was truly gross having to stay with the mess left behind by the previous occupants  I was truly disappointed by how management handled the room situation   however they agreed to reimburse us for our dinner and breakfast A heads up to everyone if you find good deals on Expedia   go the extra step and log on to the actual hotel website  Chances are youll be able to secure a deal just as good if not   better than offered through Expedia  Then if anything goes wrong you are able to negotiate directly with the hotel  
N => Avoid this one     This hotel is terrible  Whatever you do do not attepmt this hotel it is nothing that is reported to be  My girlfriend and I stayed here from      The outside of the hotel is drab and disgusting  The so called quotreationsquot are to the lobby and the corporate section of the hotel  You pay  per night for parking  If you ided to go to the hotel park next door for only  per night  Only one staff member was helpful the rest ignored us  Our reservation did not match that of the room we were given  Upon entering our FIRST room we smelled dirty laundry and body odor  We used the toilet to find out it was broken  The wallpaper was peeling and falling off  We had already unpacked by the time we used the toilet  We went to the desk and they said it would be fixed shortly so we left to go explore Rue St  Catherine  We arrived back at the hotel about  hours later to find out that the toilet was not fixed and we had to switch rooms and move all of our unpacked items  In the next room we had been given it smelled clean but there were burn holes through the covers on one of the beds the radioclock was broken the coffee maker was broken and the lights did not work properly  The carpet throughout the hotel was dirty and unclean  When we checked out the staff would not give us our receipt and said since we checked out they could not help us even though it was charged to a credit card Over all this hotel was overpriced drab and is not what is shown in the pictures by any means  I suggest avoiding this hotel at all costs 
N => Nice Place Freindly Staff Good Location from shops and restaurants everything relatively walking distance  Staff was professional and accomodating  Gym and Jacuzzi were great  The room was bigger than we expected but the carpet near the closet was a little bit wet when we first arrived but overall a good stay  
N => it was alright      My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for only one night    Originally I had booked a room with  king size bed but when we got there at the check in time pm the room wasnt ready and we were told that it would be another hour but we can have a room with  queen size bed right away so we took that instead  The room itself was not too bad the beds were fine the air conditioning was excellent but the carpet was dirty looking  The bathroom was clean only problems were the tub drain seemed clogged because the water was draining very slowly therefore I was standing in a tub full of water for my shower but we didnt ask for it to be fixed therefore I cant say anything about their maintenance service and the sinks water pressure was very weak  The pool was great it was the first day it was open when we were there so the heater was not at full strength yet so the water was cold but the lifeguard was great about cleaning the bugs and leaves before we got in  They had a nice looking fitness facility and restaurant but we did not use the facility or eat at the restaurant  The parking was  and underground  The location was exactly as described on the website it was steps away from St Catherine st itself but was really about   blocks away from the main attractions and shopping on St Catherine st  For the price that I booked this hotel discount on hotels I would stay here again but for regular price I would stay somewhere closer to the main attraction  Montreal itself was fantastic though 
N => Great Service Happy Place I found some of these reviews not only unfair but inaccurate  The carpet for instance looks brand new  I found my stay quite pleasurable and the rooms quite a bit bigger than the average hotel room  The staff was pleasant well informed and willing to take the time to explain things  They are centrally located and within easy access of all main attractions  I think that the only sour note was the restaurant I was told that they are changing its management   so I have hope for that too  Overall quite a good experience I would recommend it to anyone  
N => Not the Ritz but a bargain on Hotwire This is not the ritz but I do not know what the other travelers expected  I got this spot for   on Travelocity  Room was clean front desk was helpful  About   blocks from the action st  catherine st etc  Hot tub was in good working order  Dont expect a lot of whistles and bells but this place was clean and OK 
N => Terrible never again It was a bad experience I booked online for  a night  Upon checkout I was charged more per night  After a fifteen minute arguement we split the idfference  I got my Internet booking price for one night and paid their price the other  I have tried to get some action on this from the Days Inn for two months to no avail  Upon checking in my hair dryer was broken  It took  hours to get one that worked Work was being done on the hotel  We entered and exited through a puddle filled dirty garage  The only good thing I can sayis the room was clean and the location is good  It is not enough to overcome my bad experience  
N => nothing great to expensive for what you got dirty carpets room and hallway televsion sucked mabye  channelsput notice on door second day stating not to clean or disturb room when we came back room had been entered and cleaned anyway good comments ony the bathroom which had just been refinished  
N => Not a bad hotel and the location is pretty good I was pleasantly surprised by the look of the lobby when my wife and I checked in  After reading other reviews I was a bit worried especially about the parking situation  We ended up paying an extra  a day to park in the same lot as the police station so that we didn t have to worry about the car  Thankfully because of other reviews for this hotel I took out rental insurance because our car was hit in Toronto  Other than that our room was ent and the location wasn t bad  The hotel is a few blocks away from Old Montreal and very close to a subway stop to take you anywhere else Overall I was happy with this hotel because of the deal  I got on it per night  
N => Unsafe Location   do not park in the outdoor lot The hotel was okay   the room was dark the air conditioner noisy and the hallway smokey  The poor rating is due to customer service  The indoor parking lot was full so we parked in the outdoor parking lot half a block from the hotel  Our car was broken into     twice  When we told the gentelman at the front desk after the first break in he said quotI told you to take your valuables out of the car quot After much discussion he reluctantly took off the parking lot charge from our bill Do NOT park your car in that outdoor lot  If the Days Inns indoor lot is full park your car around the corner in the indoor parking garage day  
N => Travelers Nighte When me and my family arrived on a Friday for a  day visit to Montreal the location was perfect  Then the nightes started  The first night the whole rd floor where they placed us was full of Partying young folks  Screaming Slamming Doors Crying Boy friend Girl friend fights up until  a m  after neumerous calls complaining to the front Desk  We thought it was resolved but the second night the same thing  No resolution Well Sunday they all departed  We thought the end of our troubles  But no the last two nights after returning from site seeing to our suprise our room was never cleaned  The Cleaning Staff had left and the only thing the Hotel could do is replace towels No resolution was ever made except for  drink vouchures for me my wife and children We were never offered to move to another floor or adjust our bill  We sent an e mail to Days Inn Headquarters only to be refered back to the Management of the hotel which again made excuses with no action  I guess Corporate Headquarters Days Inn cannot be bothered with customer service Issues Directly  The only thing good I can say about that hotel it has a Great Restaurant with Great food  
N => Good hotel nice room We stayed at the hotel for three nights during il  The room was fine for our needs although we had some trouble with our key cards  They did not work for a while and we had to be let in with a key a couple of times  Even after our key cards starting working it took a few attempts at putting the card in the slot to get in The room was fine comfy beds good bathroom but the only problem was the room was pretty dark we needed lights on even in the middle of the day and the lights themselves wernt particularly bright But that was our only problem The hotel was a short walk from the metro station and had a nice restaurant next door which sold breakfast lunch and dinner  We ate in there a few times and it was very nice The area around the hotel wasnt too great at night we felt a bit uncomfortable but I think this was the same in quite a lot of areas around Montreal  But the hotel is great for a low budget stay its good value for money and has free wireless internet which was a plus 
N => Satisfactory stay I had to travel to Montreal and needed an inexpensive but ent place to stay that was also close to a certain place  I booked the Days Inn mostly because of the location and Wyndham Rewards points  The staff for the most part were friendly and the rooms were average  If you dont speak French you  have a little trouble as the phone books are all in French and half the TV stations are French  I didnt even know where to go to eat because I dont know my way around  So I stuck to the hotel restaraunt  But the restaraunt was closed at weird hours and I dont think I ever saw the bar open  I thought the hotel was a bit overpriced for what you got but then again its Montreal and everything is more expensive there  Overall it was okay  
N => perfect for what I needed I must say I was rather pleased with my stay at the Days Inn Montreal Downtown The plusses GREAT location close to the old city the Metro and downtown the price was right   a night for a multiple night stay in the summer  the little restaurant adjacent to the lobby was nice with good food and reasonable pricing  they sold LaRonde amusement park tickets at a good price  the front desk staff was amazingly helpful during my stay room was cleanThe minuses room was a bit small   we had  full size beds so there was not much free room but it was mostly a non issue as we were in Montreal to see the city not spend time in the room  the washroom is a traditional washroom design with everything in one room unlike most hotels where the sink and mirror are out in the bedroom which made things slow in the morning for us I had two teenage girls with me This said the plusses way outweigh the negatives  I will stay there again 
N => Dirty Hotel Hotel was horrible  The first night we had to park in the outdoor parking lot and I didnt feel comfy with the dark neighborhood and the drunk people walking around  The outdoor lot was shared with  other buildings and there was no clear kings on what spots belonged to the hotel  When asking the front desk people all  of them had no clue on which spots I can park in  The next  nights we were able to park indoors but space is limited to first come first serve  There is only about  spots inside  The room had a nasty odor to it and the walls and floors looked dirty  On the last day we went to have breakfast outside of hotel and we came back to the room well before the checkout time and we found they already started cleaning the room  The fresh fruit in our fridge was removed and no where to be found 
N => Perfect location This hotel is perfectly located near Old Montreal and Chinatown and has easy access to the m tro just a  min  walk  We used the outdoor parking one night but preferred the indoor parking for the other nights  I recommend requesting the indoor parking as it is limited and on a first come first serve basis  However once you have it its yours for the rest of your stay  The small room was adequate for our purpose it was clean and comfortable and had the amenities needed  The bathroom could use a refurbishing job  It is old but it worked and was stocked up with the needed basics and a hairdryer  The front desk clerks were helpful especially Maxime and Zoraida  Only one thing bothered us and it was adequately addressed  Our door stuck a little and it had to be pulled tight to make sure it closed otherwise it did not  After our first day out we came back to find the door had not been closed and we could only assume it was by the maid who probably did not realize it happened  So we went down to the front desk to explain the problem  Nothing was missing but we were still distrht to think that our room had been exposed all day long  The front desk clerk said that it would be noted to the maids to be careful and to close the door tightly  We even saw him make a note on a clipboard somewhere  The next day after we returned from our day of touring we not only found the door open but the dead bolt was sticking out making it completely impossible to close the door  That really bothered us and we went down to the front desk again repeated our story explained that we had reported the problem but this time it was worse since the open deadbolt seemed like a deliberate act   The evening manager came up to verify the incident and apologized profusely saying he would make sure this did not happen again  The next morning when I woke up I noticed the   guarantee on the key pad that explained that any unsatisfactory portion of the stay would be   reimbursed  So when we went down to check out I asked the front desk about this guarantee clause  It was a different clerk from the previous day and he asked us if something was missing after I explained to him why I was asking for some type of compensation for my worries  We told him quotnonothing was missingquot but nevertheless it did not matter it was the principle of safety that was at stake there  I wanted to know what the hotel was going to do about that part  The clerk acted surprised not seemingly understanding what we were asking  Fortunately his st colleague a wonderful young lady called Zoraida jumped in the conversation told us that she understood completely how that could be stressful to not feel safe that she was going to make sure that the maids were really being told about this problem and quotwould we be happy if she gave us vouchers for a free breafkastquot We thanked her for her understanding of our situation and accepted the breakfast vouchers  That gave us a chance to taste their breakfast which was very good I can recommend this hotel despite the glitch with the room  I would recommend to check the door of your room and if it does not close on its own like all hotel doors should just ask to move rooms  
N => Not Bad I stayed at the Days Inn with a group of about  people that traveled from Newfoundland to attend the Bodog Battle of the Bands  All of us between the age range of    The first night there was great and same with the second night  We celebrated the chance of making it big with the Bodog battle  But the third night for some reason the hotel management put a group of  year olds on a ski trip on a floor with  young adults  Then threatened to kick us out if we didnt keep it down  Keep in mind we were in our hotel rooms on the opposite side of the hotel  So we agreed to keep it down we werent hard to get along with   but it made absolutely NO sence why they would do this   year old children and bands celebrating do not mix  The food however was AMAZING  The little restaurant service was above and beyond awesome and the food was perfectly delicious  For the price we paid it was worth it  But management needs to re think where they book people on each floor  
N => Bad experience This was my worst experience in a hotel  I ided to choose this hotel because it was cheaper  But it ended up costing me more  We arrived at the hotel and it looked okay but then I went to the washroom and the toilet wouldnt flush so I called the front desk and they sent a maintenance guy  Well he ended up coming   times and spending the night in our room  The toilet still wouldnt flush the bathtub would not drain and the air conditionning was not working and it was a hot night  In the mini fridge we found stuff from the previous people and found garbabge under the bed  Also there were bugs  I was sick of staying in this hotel  So I called a friend and he agreed to come pick us up in montreal  So we had to pay  hours of gas and I asked the front desk to not charge my credit card but when I got my credit card statement they charged me MORE than the usual cost of the room  SO now I have to fight to get my money back  BAD experience  NOT recommended AT ALL  
N => Corteous staff good location good hotel great location near latin quarter old town and chinatown just few bus stop from the train station We actually requested to change the standard non smoking double room we booked because of some smell of cigarette and the staff without even checking they moved us to a mini suite room without paying any difference of course  They gave us informations and map and they were very corteous  Room was confortable and clean 
N => Great for the Money I had been to Montreal a couple of times before but the hotel where I had stayed one before was closed down  My wife and I ided on booking through Tripadvisor at this hotel based on reviews on other travelers and the location of the hotel  It was an overall good experience  We spent little time in the hotel so do not have any complaints  The room was great we had the king suite which was more affordable than a lot of regular rooms at other downtown hotels  
N => Great weekend stay The hotel is easy to find and perfect location  It was within walking distance to all the places we wanted to go  Rooms are on the smaller side but not too crowded  Front desk was quick and efficient and friendly  Parking is just across the street and very reasonably priced  for the weekend  Rooms were clean and comfortable  There seemed to be a lot of groups on our floor but once in the room we never heard any noise from other rooms  Overall a great stay  
N => Beware check in time is  pm Location is good close to Rue Ste  Catherine historic Montreal and Chinatown  Beds were ok but the bathroom showed some wear  No safe in the room but there was an iron hair dryer coffee service  Arrived around noon but their check in time is  pm  We got up that day for a very early flight so we were anxious to take a short nap before we hit the town  Although they told us to check starting at pm which we did every hour we didnt get a room until  mins before  pm  It used to be a good deal but Ill spend a bit more for a nicer hotel and earlier check in  
N => Spend your Days and nights OUT of this hotel My girlfriends and I chose this hotel because the location seemed to be good and the price was ent  We booked  rooms for  nights  Upon arrival we were placed in  small not adjacent smoking rooms when we had asked for non smoking  The windows did not open in the room and the smell of smoke was nauseating  We inquired multiple times about switching rooms and told we were going to be called when a room came available  No phone call no communication whatsoever  The location was just okay for our needs  Not close enough to walk to many of the clubs and bars we were interested in visiting  That was our fault for not choosing our hotel location wisely  The staff was cordial and the bartender was very nice offereing suggestions and tips on where to go  Still they were unwilling to switch us into a non smoking room which was annoying  The rooms were also tiny and perhaps because of the smoke just didnt feel clean to me  Overall the hotel wasnt horrible but there are better options for the same or a little extra money  Skip the Days Inn Downtown and explore another option  
N => A great place for a short visit Although my wife and I were a bit hesitant to book at this hotel because of some of the reviews we wanted to be able to spend more money in the city than on lodgings so we booked two nights  It was economical close to both the Old City and the Latin Quarter where we had tickets to a special concert and easy to find we are not yet well acclimated to Montreal  We DID choose to park inside and to upgrade the room to a suite with King bed and microwave due to the safety factor and our own needs  First of all we found the staff helpful gracious prompt and very forthcoming with information and tips on how to enjoy Montreal to its fullest  Second the hotel truly was amazingly easy to get to from Route  coming from New England   take  to the end in the center of the city find Boulevard Rene Levesque take a right go down  blocks and its right there Third walking toward the water gets you to the Old City and the Old Port in about  minutes ditto for the Latin Quarter north and several other advantageous attractions  And finally the rooms We somehow got a conference room attached to our suite fine for stretching out and I can imagine conducting a small conference comfortably there  The bed was huge and very comfortable the bathroom was immaculate and spectacular in every way air conditioner units kept our rooms exceptionally comfortable and the location of our room close to but not ON Rene Levesque allowed for a little traffic noise but not enough to disturb us  The room was one of the refurbished suites and soundproofing and comfort level overall was amazing   and the chambermaid cleaned up the room well into the afternoon for us  For CAN total we were extremely satisfied and will stay there again for every one of the above reasons  The next time though well be staying for an entire week 
N => SMALL Rooms    Overall bad experience    I stayed here t   and once was enough for me    The hotel was clean thats were the good qualities end   The staff was not so much rude just blank would be the best way to describe them  The rooms and hotel itself was very small  The room had  beds and a TV stand which left enough room for  person to walk around the room  The doors around the hotel all lock behind you meaning and I found out the hard way you cant take the stairs    If you go into the stairwell you have to go all the way to the ground level go outside it was raining that night walk around the building back to the front and if its past a certain hour you have to wait for the Front Desk clerk to buzz you in  The parkings the other thing    This is more a personal thing for me I like to have my car parked in a garage when Im on vacation  They have an outdoors parking lot up the block which some might not think is in the greatest of neighborhoods  And you have to get a new parking pass for your car every day its in the lot just kind of a pain because if you do it in the morning you have to deal with the Check In wait All in all I personally had a horrible experience in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone    The only reason we stayed here was because we ided to take the trip late and all our other choices were booked up  
N => Not TOO bad    I just return from this hotel  First the girl at the reception vas very nice and the lobby was very clean  Even though it was around  p m  the hotels restaurant was empty  Strange    I didnt try it but reading the previous commentaries I understand why there was no one there    The room was good relatively clean BUT there was something I couldnt identify almost everywhere on the furnitures the tv even the bed something really greasy something like oil only on some spots  Each time we touched something we were disgusted  be it was the product used to polish but     well    If you go there which is not totally a bad idea if your budget is limited please ask for a room that is not in front of the boulevard  At around  in the morning youll hear buses trucks motors horns    because theres a lot of traffic  You can easily walk to many attractions but dont expect a calm quiet and beautiful street  It is not  Once you are aware and are ready to accept those conditions then you wont be diasappointed and your stay can even be good  
N => a little funky around the edges On par for Canada chains but you expect more in Montreal a once vibrant city which seems to be in line compared to its old glory days  
N => Great Hotel This hotel was great especially for the price we paid  When we arrived we found out they had upgraded us from a room to a suite at no extra charge  The staff were very nice and polite and had no problems telling us how to get to certain attractions  Maps and directions were always provided  We definitely got our moneys worth I recommend this hotel for couples  There isnt a pool or games room so I wouldnt recommend it for kids  But their rooms are very nice and clean and modern  No complaints here 
N => Overall Not Bad This hotel served our basic needs good location reasonable etc  The downstairs parking had a horrible odor I detected a sewer problem  Deluxe Room on the th floor was fine although the room layout was wierd they had large blocked out areas possibly to house plumbing etc that created difficult areas around the bed to move and there was no TV in the bedroom living area TV couldnt be viewed from the bed the loveseat was situated so you had to cock your head anyway   staff was pleasant food in the Bistro was actually ent  Great soup  Allegro is NOT timely in opening up on time  PM for lunch had me waiting for a body to arrive the coffee was not even brewing yet and it took  minutes to grab a few drinks to take to my room no room service  Room was clean and seeing it was New Years Eve it wasnt that noisy the clientele is young at least during college breaks   
N => The best will not be found here  
N => Not too bad  
N => A bit too basic  
N => good value  
N => Days Inn Montreal  
N => Very nice location trouble free self parking easy walk to old Montreal The Delta Centre Ville is the easiest hotel in Montreal to find  After you drop off your luggage will the Bell Captain you can self park your car  We never used our car in the six days as we were able to walk everywhere My wife and I traveled to Montreal for the International Diabetes Conference  We chose the Delta Centre Ville for it s location to the conference center and being able to walk to the conference underground if the weather was inclement  While my wife was at the conference I spent a lot of time at the hotel and walking around Montreal which is a great way to see the city  I was impressed with how clean the city was I found the Bell Staff Housekeeping and Room Service Staff to be very helpful and friendly  The Front Desk Staff seamed a little put out when you asked them a question one staffer member even told me to ask some else to help me  Not warm and fuzzy  We did not eat in the restaurant but we did enjoy a drink in the lounge  Service in the lounge was adequate  There was a very nice pool and work out room The hotel s location makes it easy to walk down to old Montreal were you will find many great restaurants  It is a short walk up to St  Catherine street and again you can walk in the tunnels back to the hotel  
N => Not Good This accommodation was booked for me by my Union for a convention  The location was appealing however the Hotel itself lived DOWN to all the reviews I have read on Trip Advisor  Shabby unclean and in great need of updating  The coffee maker looks toxic  The maid was who gave me directions to the ice machine was nice  
N => typical business hotel fine for us Booked this on Hotwire and got a good deal  We checked in late due to lost baggage staff were very welcoming  We had a nice big room and comfy bed  The only thing we did not like was that the room smelt of cigarette smoke this was probably mentioned at check in but i was not listening properly It was not the end of the world and we didnt ask to change room but you  want to mention this at check in  The location was good and easy to walk into town  also handy to have the free internet access in the lobby  
N => Really friendly staff and an elegant atmosphere I had the opportunity to accompany my boyfriend to Montreal last week as he was going on business  We stayed at the Hampton for the first couple of nights but booked ourselves downtown for an extra night at the Delta  Let me first say be careful which one you book There are actually two Delta locations downtown Montreal and they are not very far from each other  We actually went to the wrong one at first and had to go get back in the car and drive around to the other location  Driving in Montreal is very confusing as they have so many one way streets and if you don t have a GPS you are going to end up going on and off a lot of highwaysOnce we got to the right Delta they had valet parking in the front which we opted out of  I found out that we could just park ourselves  Parking was located on the other side of the building and was a little tricky to get to  We ended up driving around the building twice before finding out how to get into the underground parking  It was  dollars a night to park which gave you access to come and go as you please  Luckily we were only staying a night and although I found it hard to cough up  dollars just to park we didn t have any other options so we just went ahead with it  The parking garage is very tight and a bit small  We took a cab to where we wanted to go so we luckily got a great parking spot as we arrived around pm  I noticed later at night a lot of cars waiting for people to move so they can get a spot it looked like it was very very hard to find a parking spot in the evening I m glad we didn t have to worry about that  The entrance of the hotel is beautiful it is very elegant and the hotel has  floors  Check in was a breeze and the staff was more then friendly  They even advised me to go to the concierge desk and get a map for Old Montreal as they had fireworks that evening  I was so thrilled She also gave us a room on the rd floor which had a fairly good view of downtown Montreal  The room in my opinion was smaller then most hotel rooms I have been in but it was nice  The bed was super comfy the pillows were awesome and the bathroom was quite nice  The bathroom had a feeling of being in a spa and even included some spa soaps and other toiletries  It was very clean and very quiet  Later that evening we got the map from the concierge and went downtown we saw the fireworks which were the most impressive firework displays I have ever seen  Old Montreal is absolutely gorgeous and very romantic  We ided to take a horse drawn carriage ride which was about  minutes in duration  Old Montreal has a lot of unique architecture along with cobble stone roads  It is very busy at night and I would recommend taking a cab  The cab was less then  dollars one way from the hotel to the pier where the fireworks were which was right down in Old Montreal  I absolutely loved MontrealWe had breakfast at the restaurant in the morning which was OUT OF THIS WORLD I know it was just breakfast but it was so delicious The orange juice tasted like it came right out of the orange and they had so much selection of hot and cold options  We obviously ate way too much as we opted to go for the hot and cold breakfast buffet  It was about  dollars each but was well worth itAll in all I really enjoyed this hotel it was elegant and clean and the staff was very friendly  The only negative thing I would have to say is that the room was a bit small  However the price was great especially for Montreal Don t expect to pay less then   a night at most hotels downtown Montreal  This one was   which saved us some money  If you need anymore insight feel free to send me an e mail 
N => Overall a good place to stay Staff polite and helpful Connected to subway and underground walkway  Small pointless swimming pool Nice revolving restaurant on top  
N => Not my first choice    This hotel was really our only choice of a place to stay in Montreal  Both myself and my fiancee work in the hotel industry in the itimes and therefore get a pretty ent rate  Unfortunately all the hotels in my corporation in the area were booked up having travelled there in the week before Christmas  So the Centre ville was our only choice  The staff was rude and very unhelpful with the exception of the in room dining staff who were polite and a great asset to the company in my opinion  We reserved a King room smoking on the Signature Lounge floor since Im a DP Platinum member  Instead we got a double double nonsmoking on the th floor  Not Impressed  We went to see a Canadiens game for my birthday but none of the staff could give me ent directions to the Bell Centre  In fact the gentleman at the desk pointed and grunted quotIts over therequot However the hotel is in a great location for any business traveller looking to be close to the hustle and bustle  Parking is expensive but worth it  Dont bother trying to drive in the city unless youre a seasoned veteran  Overall not an enjoyable experience  
N => Poor customer service otherwise  fair to good  hotel Was greeted upon arrival by a VERY soiled toilet seat yuck  Hotel response was quotooops   sorry about thatquot with no effort to make ammends e g  room change upgrade etc  I restated concerns upon returning home when the hotel chain sent the standard follow up request for comments via email      no response from them     I cannot recommend hotel based on this experience alone   will not return  
N => IN NEED OF RENO Would not go back until I knew that they have done major reations  Very Dated and in need of overhaul  
N => Clean but nothing to impressive The hotel is just okay  The staff was very nice and helpful  The rooms were just okay  A bit outdated   you could see a few areas where the carpet was coming up  We stayed there because of a business meeting and had my family travel with me  If you are trying to impress your customers this is not the place to stay  They do offer the opportunity to upgrade to a quotdeluxquot room but I found out later that it is the same thing as a regular room  The location was great because it was in the middle of everything  If you are not a picky person this would be an okay hotel to stay at but for less that  a night  
N => This delta is just okay     Rate was good booked online at the Delta websaver Location is great easy access to shopping train station metro etc  Rooms are spacious but a little dated there was a small hole in our sheets and the carpet a bit frayed old small tv no fridge in our room which was inconvenient for a family with a  year old and  year old  Pool was very cold    degrees and not suitable for young children as its shallow end was  feet  inches and had a sharp drop off  Lifejackets available however  Room service was very slow  Bell captain refused to let us take the luggage cart to our room   was rude and then when we did get our bags to the lobby no help was offered  Kids werent offered the check  in package advertised however when we asked the next day we were given the package Overall   just an average hotel   cleanliness was good and the rate was good  
N => Very comfy room th floor but getting dated  We stayed here for  nights NHL ALL STAR weekend  The hotel reveiced a Star Reduction the week before our arrival from a  Star to a    We agree that it certainly was not a  star as the rooms are beginning to look a bit dated and the room security was ginal at best  No deadbolt on the door and just a simple chain across the door did not keep us at ease  The check in staff is very professional and kind  Our room was on the th floor  It was right next to the elevators which added to some unwanted noise  The cold water tap did not work and just spun around and around  The hot water took quite a while to reach our floor as well  The living room was very bizarre  There was a large dresser with the TV that was ft from any wall with alot wasted space in the room and made it look like something was missing or taken for another room  Odd to say the least The king bed was very very comfortable and the pillows were just as comfortable  We slept extremely well  You can reach the subway system through the underground you can get to the Gare Central as well  All shopping downtown can be accessed from the hotel as well  
N => Perfect location to enjoy both the old  My husband and I recently traveled to Montreal  Before booking I read the top   reviews of the best places to stay based on price upkeep of the hotel service etc  More importantly before booking I wanted a hotel that would be in quotthequot location  I didnt want to have to take the Metro or rely on taxis I wanted to be able to walk to St  Catherines Street for the shopping and to Old Montreal where we would dine in the evenings  I believe I found that in the Delta Centre Ville  It was literally a   minute walk up up hill all the way to St  Catherines and a  minute walk in the other direction to Old Montreal  It was PERFECT As for the hotel it was clean modern everything you would expect from a Delta it wasnt run down or in need of any repair  The hotel staff were very helpful front desk concierge bellmen  And the price was right  In fact the rate we paid was less than the number  location listed on Trip Advisor as the place to stay in Montreal  I was alerted to this location because of an advertisement I saw in my Aeroplan e newsletter  Our trip was amazing we had an an awesome dinner at restaurant kitty corner to the first church built in Old Montreal  And of course now my husband wants to go back Dont be afraid to check out the Delta Centre Ville  
N => comfortable hotel a bit pricey This hotel was very nice  The room size was fine The staff were very professional and helpful at any time  I love the consignere he absolutely great and helped us out in a funny situation with a city tour  Not sure what we would have done without him  Finding a place to eat outside the hotel was a bit of a walk since we didnt have a car  Overall the hotel was efficient clean and would go back again  
N => Loved this Delta Great rooms helpful staff perfect location  Can find nothing to complain about  
N => Nice stay    We booked this hotel Hotwire blind for  per night and after reading the reviews on trip advisor I was terrified  I even tried to convince Hotwire to give us a credit for another trip because I HATE Bad hotels   but they would not So we arrive at the Delta Center ville   Ann ie checked us in   she was very very professional and nice  We went to our room on the th floor room  and I was pleased to find a nice clean room in good shape  The refurbished room was appealing and the bed was quite comfortable the bath was clean too  a bit small but fine  The hotel location is fantastic   close to everything We stayed a total of three nights    and found the hotel staff to be excellent  Edwardo the concierge was great   setting us up at a nice Indian restaurant Ghandi and was very helpful throughout our stay  Habib the barkeep was very friendly and a pleasure  Everyone at the hotel  from the bell desk to housekeeping  was nice  The work out room was good enough with ellipticals treadmills weights etc  Although they do not have a spa just some small massage rooms   I had a massage by a young woman I forget her name   and that massage was fantastic Given our experience plus the very reasonable Hotwire price I would return to the Delta Centerville  The room was nice and the hotel location was very convenient to everything   but it was the staff accommodating and friendly that really won us over  I would stay at this hotel again  
N => Fine but not fantastic My family and I stayed at this hotel  nights while vacationing in Montreal  The location was amazing We parked the car night the whole time and walked or took the Metro everywhere  The Notre Dame Basilica and Old Montreal is down the street a few blocks and we easily walked there everyday without complaint from my  year old  The Metro system was less than half a block away you can also access it from the underground city directly beneath the hotel and took us everywhere else we needed to go like the Olympic Stadium and Parc du Mont Royal  When we first arrived there was a sign saying that there were contract disputes with hotel staff and some services such as room servicing would be reduced  I was a little worried about that  Check in was a breeze and we were told the Tour de Ville revolving restaurant was closed and I was a little disappointed but I understand the situation  A bell hop did offer to help us but we didnt have our luggage at the time so we just found the room ourselves We found the room to be ample size with two double beds  We had feather duvets although only one bed had a duvet cover   the other just had a sheet layed on top  But they were very comfortable  The TV was old and the unit it was in was old and falling apart when we opened it  The bathroom was clean albeit there was little room to place all the toiletries a woman needs The restaurant downstairs was fine but a little pricey  We only ate there once as none of us was that fussy about our food  The service was good  For the most part we had breakfasts downstairs in the underground city  You actually have to walk right through the middle of the restaurant to get to it but there is a Second Cup a Couche Tard convenience store MacDonalds Subway Thai express and many other fastfood type places  They all close by pm so dont plan on a quick cheap dinner there Our room was serviced regularly on the first  nights of our stay but the next  they did a hasty job  On our third night I had a sick kid so we ordered room service  We were told it would be     minutes but it was closer to   minutes  The food was no longer hot when it got to us but we were starving by that time  To top it all off no one came back to pick up the tray  We left it outside our room and when we left  days later it was still sitting there  Housekeeping just moved it to the side so they could get around it I do understand that with the contractservice staff issues there would be problems but I was really disappointed by the concierge  Now Montreal has a great nightlife   if you are an adult  As a family there is very little to do at night  We talked to the concierge about anything to do at night  He suggested The Labyrinthe at Hangar  however we had just finished doing that a lot of fun and also the planetarium  I asked about the fireworks festival they have on during the summer as I had researched it and found that there was a show on that night   when I asked the concierge about it he said I had the wrong night  Too bad  So we went back to the room and called the planetarium   for local calls and although they have evening shows for adults not recommended for children under  its only on weekend nights  So we ended up sitting in the hotel room watching TV  A little after  that night what do I hear Yep   the sound of fireworks going off  We missed them because of bad info from the concierge  That soured my whole experience We played in the pool a few times  It was nice a little busy at night so we swam in the morning when it was quieter  Did not use the fitness centre or the child centre play room for little kids so I cannot comment on them  
N => Great to stay  My fiance and I booked our hotel through Hotwire  This was the first time that we have used this service and were very happy with what we got Parking was a little expensive at day but it was very convenient Check in was a breeze  They had originally given us a room with two double beds but changed it to a King with no problem  The location of the hotel gave us the ability to walk to Old Montreal with no problem  We took a taxi a couple of times due to rainy weather but found that anywhere we wanted to go was fairly close anywayWe spent a couple of hours one after noon at the pool  It was a little small and the water was surprisingly chilly but it was very nice and also very clean  The best part is that there is a nice outside patio with tables and chairs and lounge chairs  It was very nice being able to sit outside in the sunshine and relax after walking around the city all dayThe hotel was very clean and very comfortable and I would certainly stay here again if I was going back to Montreal  
N => Not a good experience  Having completed arecent stay at the hotel everything went fine until our departure day  Upon going to the valet for our truck we were told it could not be located  The valet still had the key but the truck was no longer in the hotel garage  The truck was stolen and the valet seemed to brush it off as if it was of no concern to him  Later that day we learned of another American who had his pick up stolen out of the same garage a week prior  
N => Great location Stayed at this property for an awards dinner and I would definitely go back  The rooms were fine the restaurant had good food we only ate breakfast there so I can only speak for breakfast room service was fast and the food was ent  The concierge was extremely helpful in providing directions making reservations etc  and even gave us umbrellas when it rained unexpectedly  The ballroom and meeting space was also good and the staff was very accommodating and even though French was their native language they always spoke English to each other when working with us not just speaking English to us so we never felt like they were saying things about us while standing right there not knowing what was going on I would return to this property  
N => Would Not Return LocationThe Delta Centre Ville is difficult to get to if you are driving there  It is in a good area close enough to walk to Old Montreal and also walking distance to the shopping Montreal is so famous for Check InPierre at the check in was rude as were the valet parking attendants  Club RoomWe stayed in a club room and all of the staff in the Club lounge was very friendly and helpful  The breakfast offered there was a small buffet of limited fruits bread and coffee  In the evening their selection of appetizers was also very limited to a small plate of veggies and dip and an even smaller plate of sushi  There is also an honour bar  but at   for a small glass of Chardonnay I wouldnt recommend it  Instead take some food back to your room and buy a bottle of nice Champagne or wine at the SAQ The room was small and although we were not on a smoking floor it stunk of cigarettes as soon as we walked through the door  The night table was filthy  The bathroom was clean but again smelled of smoke  There were up graded amenities in the bathrooms on Club room floors Overall the Club Room was not the typical larger room with upgraded amenities that I am used to  I would save my money and go with a regular room if I had to stay at this hotel Exercise RoomA good selection of cardio equipment and limited strength training equipment all filthy SpaGood pedicure and manicure nice atmosphere  A variety of spa services and massage therapy offered here Room ServiceA variety of options  I had a vegetable stir fry that was bland and over priced  Not recommendedOverallWe were guests of the Delta Centre Ville as a part of a conference so did not have the choice of what hotel to stay at  There are many other hotels of better quality in the area so I would not recommend this place  Although it was not the worst hotel in the world  or even in Montreal  it fell far below my expectations  
N => Not recommended Upon entering the parking garage a sign quotDelta Hotel Parking Lot Fullquot was in front of one doorway  So I went through the other one which belonged to the shopping centre which is closed on the weekends  The garage is VERY low so beware  I had to trek my  yr old up two flights of stairs two sets of escalators and walk through the hotel restaurant to get to check in  The clerk was very friendly with my dhter and pleasant  The bell hop came over took my key card and asked where my truck was    I told him in the parking garage and he said quotohquot and gave me my hotel key back  I had assumed they werent allowed to follow me down to help with his response  Off my dhter and I went to get our bags  Once again we made our trek back up two sets of stairs from the parking lot and as we began on the one escalator my dhter was ahead of me and I had five bags in my hands  My dhter started up and fell head first down the escalator  Long story short I got in touch with the manager   I was furious He did compensate by giving us a meal at the revolving restaurant upstairs but he did say hed get back to us and never did  I also asked the manager if the bell hop was allowed to come down and he told me yes  So I was even more frustrated as to why I didnt get any help   I asked both the hop and clerk if there was an easier way to get to it and was told no The hotel room was small there was a patch job done on the floor that was the consistency of concrete just slapped down and the bathroom taps in the sink looked as if they had mold inside them  There was a hole in the wall from the doorknob  My sheets had blood on them and I had to have them changed  The pool was nice but freezing the gym small but they have TVs attached to the treadmills location is about the only thing that was good for me  However there is a Hilton right across the street and a riott even closer to the centre that I would try next time Usually I am not a picky person and we only paid  per night I think anything more would be a rip which is rare in centre city hotels   but the whole fall set a bad taste in my mouth I did manage to get a massage and that was awesome   but the place is a arate company to the hotel   and the hotel charged me each time to call the massage company next to the pool on floor  to book   but couldnt book it for me at the front deskLastly parking from friday night at pm to sunday at am cost me    which I thought was ridiculous  
N => Very Comfortable Booked a room at the Delta witha great rate through Hotwire  Location was good and hotel was easy to find  The bed was extremely comfy and cozy room was stylish and spacious  Concierge was very helpful  We used the pool briefly sort of cold and ordered room service excellent  Check out was a breeze on the TV overall a great stay for a great rate  Nice hotel 
N => All worked out in the end I went with my cousin on business she requested a suite with a pull out couch and a chair so we would have extra sleeping room and could hold a small meeting and that it not be close to the elevator  They stated that it would be no problem  Upon our arrival we went to the room it was right beside the elevator the suite had a large board room table in the other room and the whole area had a stale smell as well as there were stains on the bathroom floor  We went down and complained that A  it was not what was requested being beside the elevator and having a large table with chairs instead of a pull out couch  We were assured we would be placed in another room and to come back in awhile we stated we would be back in  hours  We arrived  hours later to find nothing had been done and that a new manager was working and had no clue what we were talking about  At this point we are very frustrated but realize it is not the current managers fault his name was Roger and offered us another room to make up for the inconvenience  The next room was exactly what we wanted and more we requested that the pull out couch be set up this evening  we went on our merry way and upon returning at pm to see the pull out couch was still not set up we called down and they said the housekeeps  be all gone but they will have someone come up The man who came up was nice and set the bed after he left i sat on it and it folded up it was like something from a comedy we called down stairs again to ask if someone could come look at it  They did and realized that infact the pull out couch isnt functional as a bed and brought in a cot  Despite our first day of frustration after that it was a wonderful few days they also proceeded to mess up the billing as well  The only useful manager is Roger  I for the money i paid i dont know if i would go back  
N => Great price for what you get Great price well located a few blocks from the edge of Old Montreal very easy to find  Booked via Hotwire a few days before our trip   about  US per night friday and saturday night  Two weekends prior we were at the Sheraton for the same price also via Hotwire  We were concerned when the booking was Delta given some of the reviews here  But our regular Delta room was MUCH larger than our club level room at the Sheraton  The Delta is much closer to Old Montreal   in fact its just a couple of blocks from the edge of Old Montreal  We walked to Notre Dame in  minutes  The Delta is also easy access to the highway being right on University Avenue  The concierge during the day was much better than the concierge late at night  The desk staff cheerful  There are only two levels of underground parking   not much relative to the size of the hotel  We did not have a problem parking I had my exotic car for this trip and made a point of finding a good spot to park underground at a opportune time  But on a busy saturday night since many people go to dine at the Delta it has the only revolving restaurant in Montreal I can see it getting full We did not try the breakfast buffet nor the dinner buffet although comments from people riding the elevator with us were positive  The pool and the workout rooms are just OK note that you have to be  to workout The reason I give it a  and not higher  there was no fridge in our room it had been removed  the cabinet that housed the TV was really beat up one door was hanging at an angle    the carpet was a bit dated and had stains   the bathrobes collar was frayed and ugly should have been thrown out   the maid tried to come in Sunday morning before  AM to clean our room  It was nowhere near checkout time Price paid notwithstanding a  star hotel should not have issues such as those listed above  
N => Loved this hotel and would definitely go back I booked this hotel through hotwire and was a little concerned after reading some reviews  I stayed at this hotel from e    the th and it was amazing  We booked through hotwire and got a room on the highest floor th which was newly reated  The bed was beautifully orated clean and comfortable The washroom was also clean and beautiful  Being a really picky person I can honestly say this hotel was great The only minor problem we had was that our ice machine did not work which meant that we just had to go to another floor  The hotel was also in a perfect location and within walking distance to Old Montreal and downtown  Like other people have said the concierge and receptionist were extremely friendlyCant wait to go back 
N => Good hotel great price I took my  year old son across the country to Montreal my home town to see two Montreal Canadiens games go Habs  We stayed three nights  The hotel was typical of a business hotel  The rooms were a little larger than average The hotel is in a perfect location  A couple easy blocks even in  C weather west to Bell Centre and about the same north to St  Catherine Street The room rate was    with taxes  I had no problem with the bill and no problem with the service  The staff were always willing to speak English whenever my very rusty French wasnt cutting it  Room service was excellent    the food was delivered quickly it was excellent they didnt skimp on quantity and it wasnt insanely expensive like you sometimes expect My two complaints are minor  I was charged   each time I dialed the toll free number to make long distance calls with my calling card  I would have been better off phoning home with my cell phone and paying airtime and long distance rates  My son enjoyed to pool but they have no hot tubwhirlpool I would definitely stay there again  
N => Big and cold Was very dissapointed with my stay the location to go shopping was terrible when I was told that they were close  No very pratical when its cold in Montreal No warm feeling when you arrive the bell men were not smilling at all  Check in was fine but my room was very small for what I paid for Bar was quiet no ambiance but drink was good Next time I am in Montreal I will try the other Delta better comments for what I can see  
N => A terrible experience I stayed there with some colleagues while attending the NAFSA Conference at the Palais dCongress  I found the hotel mediocre and overpriced  For the most part I also found the staff not very customer service oriented they are polite but it is just a fake smile with no action behind it  They would listen but there would be no follow up  I have  direct experiences which helped me form such a negative opinion of this hotelI was locked out of my room while returning a tray late one night  A neighboring guest called the reception for someone to open my door  After waiting for over  minutes I was forced to go down to the loby in my pijamas As you can imagine it was an extremely humliating experience  There is absolutely no excuse and none was offered for this tardiness someone should have come immediately  The next day I met a nice hotel employee on the elevator who asked the typical question How is your stay  When I told him about my experience the night before he was very sympathetic and had a bottle of wine sent to my room  If only the other staff would follow suit The most serious mistake the hotel made was to completely mess up the billing of my hotel room  It had been originally booked by my company and was supposed to be paid for by them as well  Instead the Delta Center Ville charged my personal credit card without consulting or letting me know this is what they would do  they had previously asked for my credit card for room service charges as they put it    It cost me a great deal of effort to remedy this before I departed it was the weekend and there was no one around to do anything  In the end they agreed to credit my pesonal card and bill the business card   more on this laterThe icing on the cake on that last day was the following expience This time it was the Consierge He wanted for our group  persons to take two taxis to the airport and was willing to let a mini van taxi  which was already there go  In the end when we insited on the mini van taxi we heard the conserge tell him to make sure to charge us more I have never in my life experienced anything like this in my travels   I am now back home and have for the most part forgotten this unfortunate experence but when I received my visa bill this month I was quickly reminded again  The Delta Center Ville had charged me twice for my stay both on my personal visa then proceeded to refund me twice but for less than they had charged  I have written and called them but have received no answer  Neither did the Executive Director of our comany who had the same thing happen to him  I dont understand how this hotel can be recommended as a convention hotel by the Montreal authorities I would never set foot in it again  
N => Not bad at allDelta Centre Stayed at the Delta Centre Villa first week in   Not a bad stay at all  Room was clean bed fresh and bathroom was good size  The breakfast buffet was what you would expect  The hotel bartenders are borderline rude    they dont smile take your order and then proceed to fill a waitress order  Taxes on everything in the city make it very expensive  The hotel needs more seating in the lobby  The staff other than the bartenders where attentive and nice  I would return  
N => Ok but some problems     Although I have been to Montreal before I have never stayed in this hotel before so the family ided to give it a try  There were  of us  When we arrived we were greeted by a porter  Lovely we thought and very posh  We got our keys from the reception staff who were rather rude and went to find our rooms   The porter told us that he would bring our bags up  After he had brought them up he literally demanded a tip  We hadnt any change just large notes so we explained this but he started muttering under his breath Also the pool was rather cold although the sauna and balcony was nice I got stuck in the lift and as I am only  and only study french a little at school I dont know how to say that I am stuck in the lift I pressed the call button and was put onto a french speaker  I TRIED explaining that I cannot speak very good french and it was about  minutes which felt MUCH longer before they worked out that I was stuck My sister was waiting at the top and was getting quite scared  Didnt have any meals there  
N => Fabulous experience I wanted to pass along my comments regarding my recent stay at your hotel  I found my experience to be first class  I loved the reations that you have made to the guestrooms  I was with a small group and was so impressed with the little touches that the hotel provided for us  The treats that we had waiting for us when we returned to our rooms really made a wonderful impression  I also love the new amenities that you have in the guestrooms  I have stayed at Delta Hotels in the past and really noticed the difference in the quality of your new products  And   most importantly I found the service to be terrific  From my experience checking in to the fabulous buffet dinner we had in your revolving restaurant overlooking the city      there was always someone there to help with a genuine smile on their faces  I look forward to visiting Montreal again and to staying with you to enjoy your hospitality  
N => A great weekend getaway My husband and I stayed at the Delta Centre Ville on the Labour Day weekend and enjoyed ourselves a lot When we arrived there was a LARGE tour bus ahead of us but we only waited about  minutes  They were very speedy  We found out that our room wasnt quite ready yet I think we were early to check in though but the manager who was serving us gave us a lovely room on the th floor with a great view We found the rooms to be small but comfortable  The room we were in king room had been reated new carpet bedding but the bathroom seemed a bit old  We also had a chuckle over the TV very small old and low quality but we werent there to watch TV so it didnt matter much  The hotel was close to St  Catherine good shopping and Old Montreal pretty to walk around in  What impressed me most about the hotel was the concierge  He was SO helpful  We went to ask about restaurants in Old Montreal and within  mins hed made us reservations at his favourite place and gave us a map with walking directions  He was doing the same thing for the people ahead of us and behind us too  Very helpfulWe had the Sunday brunch at the revolving restaurant and it was good  They have a  sitting and a  sitting  We went to the earlier one and although there were lots of families and kids and larger parties my husband and I still had a nice quiet meal together  The food was pretty good but I dont think we would have gone there at  each unless we had received the  voucher as part of our packageOne note about the package   they didnt advertise it but when my husband called he asked about deals  We got the quotfun packagequot or quotfamily packagequot   basically parking  and  food voucher included  We paid about  a night I believe Overall a good experience  Not sure if I would stay again though only because there are SOOO many boutique hotels and BampBs in Montreal that its fun to try out other things  
N => Not Very Good The Delta Center I must say my whole experence at the Delta Center in Montreal was not a good one  The staff there needs a crash course in Customer Service I know that the Customer is not always right but atleast try to make the customer feel that they appreciate there businessGreg Lassiter 
N => Not All Its Cracked Up to Be The hotel is beautiful and its location to old town and the new town is just great  The hotel carries a very demanding appeal but the services and its employees have much to improve onThe signature lounge upstairs on the top floor which is reserved for Delta Privilege guests is way too over rated The food service in the lounge I found to be lacking and the service personnel were very rude  Not attentive caring or very friendly at allThe Concierge was rude as well  It was like no one had any desire to cater to the paying guests I found it even more deplorable that they valet parked our car upon arrival charged me   per day to park in the garage but would not get my car upon check out I had to go scramble through the garage not knowing where the valet had parked the car and had to retrieve it on my own As I stated at the beginning of my comments this a beautiful hotel but the service has a lot to be desired 
N => Terrible We had many problems with this hotel  I even checked out one night early  Except the font desk staff The service was poor particularily in the parking was not convenient at all  Restaurant staff and room service are the worst that I saw in the world This hotel deserves  stars not   
N => Tour de ville disappointing We were two couples who ided to spend New Years Eve at the Tour de ville restaurant located in the delta  We were told over the phone that there would be a buffet and dancing  Well there was a buffet but it was quite disappointing  Usually a buffet contains many different choices satisfying everyone but not this buffet it was mostly seafood  Not everyone is a seafood lover    When people call for information about the buffet this important aspect should be mentioned  Also the service was disapointing the restaurant is non smoking which they did not mention over the telephone so smokers have to go  floors down and outside to have a cigarette There was no holiday ambiance the music was not great and at midnight they brought in the New year with a Christmas song   Overall we were quite disappointed We would not recommend it and we wont be celebrating there again  
N => Centre ville but off target  
N => Very Nice but not out of this world  
N => One of the most exciting place to stay in Montreal  
N => Very Nice Stay at the Delta My husband young son and I stayed at the Delta Montreal for four nights in ober  We actually selected the quotAroma Packagequot which offered room service breakfasts each morning and dinner in either their restaurant or bar each night  We did this because the price was excellent and it made the trip easier to not have to think about breakfast and dinner when traveling with our little boy We are really really happy with our experience there  The common spaces are beautiful festive and upscale  Our room was great as well  I was worried since there were some reviews commenting on the lack of cleanliness and the hotels real need to update  They do begin reations in uary   Since we were there for four nights I think we had a good opportunity to find things to complain about and we havent one The room was immaculate orated in a neutral elegant way the pool facility was great for laps and playing with our son the breakfasts were perfect fresh croissants and great coffee and dinners were surprisingly good  The staff was first class   never snooty but highly efficient and helpful   and the Delta really means it when they say they are kid friendly  We did not see any families other than ours but everyone on staff said a cheerful bonjour to our son wanted to make sure he knew there was a small playroom at the hotel and he ate free the whole time  So though we do tend to find faults with places we stay we really havent a single complaint about the Delta Montreal Hotel  
N => Bait and switch Hotel I booked a non smoking room thru priceline  When I arrived I was given a smoking room despite my  calls to confirming the room prior to arrival  I was told that was only room available  Room reaked of smoke  Carpet had  large stains and was ripped in several places  I was shocked to see the  star rating still I was told they might change the room the next day  The manager refused a switch saying quot that is was happens when you go thru priceline  You learned a good lessonquot besides she said all the rooms were sold out  I called the reservations in front of her and gave her a non smoking room reservation I had just secured for an early check  in  Suddenly a cancellation quotoccuredquot and she assigned me a new non smoking room I would say the customer service was aweful  If they only want to offer smoking rooms to priceline they should say so  They were aweful especially because they did not care the my three year could not breath  They wanted to teach me lession  I heard that from at least  different front desk attendant manager  
N => Excellent central hotel This is a very central hotel with everything you would expect from a modern hotel  I would gladly stay here again A few silly things let this hotel downa The length of time you have to wait for to get a dring in the bar when nobody else was standing waiting to be served b Connection to the internet in the room is only by wire and even though I had a new laptop it took ages to get the system to work  There is theoretically wifi access in the bar and restaurant but I couldnt get it to work  When I asked the guy next to me how he managed to do it he said he also could not get it to work and connected using the free wifi from the coffee chop accross the road Chez Simonc I was here at a meeting in one of the rooms and I asked reception for the wifi password  I was prepared to pay but not at the price they quoted    for the day  This must be the highest rate in the world Apparently this is the cost for everybody in the room using it and would not sell me an individual connection  Come on Delta if you are a business hotel surely you can understand that this is not acceptable Had it not been for the last point I would have given this hotel a  star rating  
N => Terrible Im not a picky traveler  Most of my reviews I would say are upbeat and I always look for the positive but I cant help but rate this hotel poorly  We booked it for a good price on hotwire which I picked because they rated it a   star and it had a pool  The pool is a necessity because its always the highlight for our kids  That and watching movies before going to bed Heres the rundown of what happenedThe first night We arrived late  about pm and the quotONLYquot room left for me my mom and my dhter in this huge hotel was a smoking room with a king size bed  We are not smokers and my dhter was gagging the whole time  So we went to the pool  The pool looked much bigger online but at least it was indoors  After getting into it however it seemed very dirty  Again I can put up with a lot but there was dirt all around the edges the water seemed cloudy and in spots the bottom of the pool seemed slippery  And there was mildew all on the ceiling  So we went back to the room hoping to see a movie and after an hour trying to work the tv and calling down to the desk they could not get it to work  By the way the tv was one of those old boxy kinds and not very big The second night We requested to be moved so somehow by am we got a non smoking room and two full sized beds that was clean and ready to be moved into  Were they really full the night before or was it because we were discount guests they didnt want to be hospitable When we tried to rent a movie that night the same thing happened  The person at the desk could not get it to work even after checking to make sure everything was activated  The itor was even sent up to the room to check it  It was kind of insulting  we are seasoned travelers who know how to rent movies It never worked so the front desk person said when we leave the room in the morning to tell the front desk and they will get a repair person to go up and fix it while we are out  Third day So in the morning we did that  Finally we got a competent person who looked in back and found that the switch had never been activated That evening we finally got to watch our movie on the old tv  Another aspect about this room the sheets on the mattress are not fitted which I dont think is unusual for beds in hotels however the sheet wasnt even pulled down over the mattress  it was like a previous review said  like the bed was short sheeted So we remade the bed not well enough I guess though because in the morning the sheet had slipped off and we were sleeping on the bare mattress GrossThe last morning I went to see what kind of compensation we could get for the mattress experience the smoky room and the tv problems and they kindly waived all my parking fees for  days  And of course we werent charged for the movie  It was fine  I dont like complaining but this was a crazy bad experience Also the concierge was only adequate  Not friendly at all but gave the basic information we asked for The hotel from the lobby looks like a   or  star but the hallways and rooms look like a  star  Worse than any cheap hotel weve stayed at  The rooms were dated  formica counters in the bathrooms  One bathroom light over the sink  making a very dark toilet and shower area  No fridge in the room  Badly stained carpets and a thick layer of dust around the corners of the room where the carpet meets the walls  Now that my kids are getting to be teens our values have switched in hotels to needing ent pools and movie service  We wont be staying here anymore  But I imagine someone looking for a deal could make this hotel work if they tuck in their sheets real well and overlook the mold and dust  The only good things were the location  right downtown  and the bar  We had dinner in the bar that first night and it was amazing  The food was delicious and beautifully presented  Better than most restaurants we went to those  days  
N => Good Location English speaking staff Rooms are a bit dated On a trip to Toronto we realized that we had an extra day  Although we loved Ottawa the last time we were in Ontario we ided to go to Montr al this time  The drive was long but its a great city to see We ided to book the Delta Montr al based on a   off Travel zoo rate and the reviews on Trip Advisor  There are two Deltas in downtown Montr al so be careful which one you book  This Delta is closer to McGill and walking distance to most tourist locations  We found it to be a good hotel  We wanted to stay at the Fairmont it cost the same that weekend but they didnt have rooms with two beds  those types of rooms are very limited as the room sizes are too small to even accommodate a cot or sofa bedWhen we got to the hotel we quite didnt know where to stop to unload  There is no driveway to the hotel  Just the road on the side  We had to circle around to find a spot to park and unload  Hotel parking is   We ided to park outside the hotel across the street  The spot was well light and right in front of the hotel entrance  Parking was free on Sunday until  PM  Check the meter as time very  There is a lot of activity around the hotel and it seemed safe  After talking to a few people that used to live in Montr al we were told that parking outside was not a good idea  Make sure you hide all valuables  We had Quebec plates on our rental so that  have helped  There are a few cheaper lots around though The rooms are pretty big  We had two double beds and a huge sitting area with a balcony  The bathroom was a bit small but did the job  The beds were also okay just like the Delta in Ottawa  The room is a bit dark and dated however  This hotel has mostly English speaking guests so we felt quite comfortable  The service was also good and the front desk spoke fluent English once you started with them in English  The business center has  computers but the internet is really slow so theyre good just to look up a few quick things before patience runs out All in all a ent hotel for the price  
N => they p   s me       with money and when I asked why the manager told me thats the best team never trust this hotelnever use ur creadit card or ur visa staff not even smilyparking is lik hell airless not safty at all i hold my horn to get help no way noone even care i had to stip out my car to get help froem loppy ROOMS    LOL JUST LOOK AT THE WINDOWS AND U CAN SEE HOW MENY SPIDERS THEIR if u nee dhelp night such as movies    u will have to call reception to got the moive what u want but dont try case i traied few tims noone even care    the thing which is really heart me when i got my bills and i thought that thirs is charge misteak on it i have been to talke with them and the manger came did nothing but to till me about here great team whos never made misteaks at all so i was the bad guy then becuse i wanted just understand somthing i sewar they made my st vist to montreal like helllllllll ill never back to this city becuse of emIll give them   out of  
N => Good hotel not sure about its rating I stayed here with my boyfriend for  nights end of ybegin ust  Booked on Expedia when we saw it had a summer deal making it cheaper than many hotels in the categorylocation Plus   location we could easily walk to town and the metro was close by  free internet at the business centre however youre bound to wait for a while as most guests want to make use of it while there are just  computers  staff were helpful and friendly Minus  we had to request a room change due to a broken shower and toilet which didnt flush properly  The friendly staff member did however immediately assign us to another room which we appreciated a lot  Said it was an upgrade   same room but with free local calls   rooms and as above weve seen more than one are quite dated television had to be switched off twice every time   when we switched it off a first time itd always pop back on to the hotel channel     had breakfast one morning chose the buffet  Found out some fruit on our plate was past its best before date Conclusion good hotel if youre in Montreal to get to know the city  Would classify it as a  star hotel however not more  Would return if I could get it at the same discount rate but not at full price  
N => Disappointing Accomodations and Misleading Information My friend and I along with our partners chose the Delta Montreal hotel from a Travelzoo special after a long and extensive search for a nice place at a reasonable rate  We were there to participate in the Montreal Dragon Boat Festival  We chose this hotel because Montreal Tourism rated it as a  star hotel  We were excited to get a good deal and to stay in a beautiful place  Service was good overall  Staff were helpful and resourceful  Room was very disappointing though  It was a small corner room our booking said it was to be an oversized hotel room  As well it was very dirty stained and torn up  Rugs were heavily stained throughout the room closet doors and walls were dirty and evidently not routinely cleaned water stains dirt smears etc  and the carpet was ripped torn and loose entering the bathroom area  It was so bad that the carpet was unravelling and numerous nail ends were exposed  I ended up stepping on these and having my heel bleed from it  There were a lot of extra expenses as well  Parking was around  a day and even a bar fridge available in your room was  a day  We ended up talking to the Manager about our experience and disappoinment where he was shocked to hear that the hotel was rated as a  star  He said that it was only a  star He also mentioned that the hotel was going to be remodelled which was why the carpets and walls were in bad shape and left this way  We ended up getting one night comped because of our complaints which we used digital photos of the room to show him the extent of the issues  It was in a good location however and we were able to walk to a lot of entertainment districts  Overall would not go back this hotel location though  Found Montreal in general to be very expensive and the atmosphere a little rude  
N => Not bad  but some minor issues I liked the Delta  It was a good middle of the road option for me and two friends who stayed there  nights while enjoying the Montreal Jazz fest Liked   location easily walkable to everything downtown  room size fine even for three adults  price not cheap but fair for the amenities in the hotelDisliked  no free internet  expensive rates for phone calls  room phones vmail function did not work  TV remote did not work  no chair on balcony  we kept dragging them in and out  few towels despite asking repeatedly  took  times to get a room key that workedOverall Id do it again but there are also lots of similar  better options nearby too if you do not mind the rates or can find a deal  
N => Great but could use some improvement I stay at the Delta Montreal on e th th  and it was great but it could use some improvement  When we arrived and went to check in to our Famliy suite the man said we booked it for tomorrow sowe couldnt go in  It was odd because when we booked it on the phone they said it was ready for e th  So we had to book a roon for one night then we could check in on e   We checked into that room and when we got in there was a big big washrooma balcony but no mini fridge  We had to use a a big bowl with ice in it  The next day e  we went down to the Restaurant and ate thebreakfast buffet it cost    Then we went to check in to the Family suite well it was amazing  One big kitchen with a full size fridgea living roombalconytwo LCD TVsa washroom and a bedroom  Overall the hotel was great but the front staff could use some improvement Note Balcony has some bugs  
N => Pretty good hotel Clean hotel  Good location  Easy to find  Parking was perfect  I would stay here again  
N => Not so good  I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago and from what I remember I was a nice hotel  Well     it isnt anymore  This is definetly not what Delta Hotels are all about  This hotel is in a desperate need of a major reations From the leaking ice machine in the hallway to bed sheets that dont even fit on their beds  Wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Disgusting  Booked through Priceline  Avoid avoid avoid I booked this place on Priceline thinking it would be a great deal  But they gave me a room that heavily reeked of cigarette smoke on the second floor facing a busy street  Although the room was big it was sparsely furnished and the lighting was very bad so it felt like an empty but smoky prison cell  Internet also cost extra  The three days I stayed there couldnt have gone by fast enough  
N => Booked through Priceline   Did not meet  stars   Filthy I stayed at the Delta Montreal  President Kennedy Avenue Montreal Quebec HA J ober   through     I booked the room through Priceline bidding for a  star hotel or better for  USD a night plus taxes and service fees The hotel would have been up to the  star rating had it been clean and in good repair  Unfortunately neither were true  I have included pictures in my review of the terrible conditions in the common areas   There was a hole in the ceiling above the ice machine   The elevator lobby from the parking garage to the main floor was filthy the entire stay  There was a piece of pizza in the ash tray next to the up button and trash on the floor   My room wasnt very clean either Note that the Priceline rate only got me a smoking room  I was informed at check in that I could pay extra to get a non smoking room but none were available any of the nights during my stay I apologize for posting this   months after my stay  I hope that the hotel has improved over the last few months but based on my experience I would not recommend staying in this hotel  
N => Great Stay  Good hotel with a fantastic bed one of the most comfortable I have ever stayed in  Very spacious we had an outdoor terrace which was sealed shut so we were a bit disappointed but it was the middle of winter so be its understandable  We checked out the hotel restaurant on the first day but was fairly pricey so we ate out every day  Overall no complaints  
N => Enjoyable stay We spent  nights at the Delta Hotel and found it to be a well run hotel  The check in lady was very friendly and when we asked if we could have a later check out she was prompt to oblige The standard room was very bright and well furnished We had a big bathroom well equiped with the more than usual soap shower cap etc The room was equipped with a internet cable which was free as well as in the reception area there were  free internet computersbut very much on demand from the guests The concierge was most helpfull with street maps and suggestions and sight seeing trips etc The breakfast which was included in our Hotel price was very good with a big choice and friendy staff  All in all we did have a enjoable stay at the hotel and felt very comfortableWe would stay again at the hotel 
N => Dishonest hotel non smoking room priceline SCAM Thanks to some previous previews I ve learned that even if there are non smoking rooms available the staff will not give them to priceline customers if they don t pay  extra  This did happen to me and I think this scam seems to be this hotel s  tradition   Of course I paid  extra to get upgraded to a  non smoking premier room   Then I checked their availabilities and called their service hotline to complain  After  minutes the manager called and explained again the  priceline policy   Without any apology she simply sent a bell captain with my new keycard helping me move to a non smoking delta room which the front desk claimed to be  sold out  If you want to bid on priceline for a  star hotel in Montreal I would suggest you try   star since you might probably get Residence Inn Downtown or Holiday Inn Express which offer complimentary breakfast and are way nicer than  star Delta  Whats more their staff doesn t cheat or discriminate their customers  
N => Okay hotel Room Average The area is close enough to tourist attractions but not great  We had to walk through some questionable apartment complex streets to get to the main tourist restaurant drag  Self parking was easy in the underground parking garage with in and out privileges  The service personnel were all very friendly  However when we asked for opinions of things or restaurants to visit we were sent to the concierge but it was always the bellman who referred us to a limited selection of brochures  The room was larger than expected with a strange layout  There was a balcony but very wet from rain  The room was musty smelling but looked clean upon inspection  Overall it was pretty average  
N => The Non Smoking Room SCAM Continues Disappointed in not finding a non smoking room who sells smoking rooms anymore in Canada I was charged an extra  per room  rooms under the same pretense as another online complaint  While there were no non smoking rooms available at the room type that I had purchased through Priceline there were plenty of non smoking rooms available for upgraded rooms  The whole experience left me feeling disgusted and I have now written Priceline for a refund  Ill follow up with the Delta head office as well  Do yourself a favour the Delta Montreal was nothing to write home about in the first place if you want to be ripped off    look for another placeBill 
N => Worst of the worst I have never written a review and I thought I would never but after stayed in this Montreal Delta  Avenue Du Pr sident Kennedy I have to This is top of my worst experience in a so called  star hotel First once we enter the room my kids found some dirty beer caps still on the floor room was not properly clean and they almost hurt their feets lucky my boy still had his socks onAnd about  minutes later  other guests just entered our room in the middle of our changing our clothes we called front desk and they said will send someone a set of new access cards right away  After  hours nobody showed up and I tried to called more than  times in between to the front desk and no one answers  Finally I have to try to call the operator and connect to the front desk and after a long ring someone answered and send us the new access cards When I told me about how the room condition to the staff all she said was quotOHquot Very bad service and experience and I very close to check out but was very tired after been travel almost a week ahead before Montreal our last destination of the trip I have been in Montreal over dozens of times and this was the first time I stayed in Delta Montreal and I will never never stay in Montreal Delta again even they pay me for it 
N => Beware of Priceline Scam I booked the Delta property through Priceline and received a great rate of  dollars a night  I had read previous posts that travelers who had booked on priceline were told when they checked in that the hotel was sold out and to receive a nonsmoking room they could pay an additional  dollar charge  I was armed with this knowledge when I checked in Upon check in I was also told that the hotel was completely sold out and that in order to receive a nonsmoking room I must pay  dollars  They even had a laminated copy of the priceline policy to show me as I complained  I of course paid the  dollars and went to my room  The quotupgradedquot room was a little worn and dated  The wallpaper was coming off the wall and there were cracks in the balcony  I proceeded to call the hotel manager to express my disdain for the  dollar fee for the upgraded room  The manager Genevieve was completely unfriendly and explained again that the hotel was sold out and she was not going to do anything about the fee I then called reservations to try and book a room at this sold out property  I was told there were plenty of rooms available at the  plus room hotel  Hmmmm Then I called the Delta customer service number that I found in the room and explained the situation and how the staff were lying to us regarding of the sold out status of the hotel  She was outraged and within  minutes she had called the hotel spoken with the aforementioned Genevieve  We had the  dollar fee removed from our bill two free buffet breakfasts for the next morning a bottle of Bordeaux and chocolates were also sent up to the room  They were busted with their priceline scam  It is an ok hotel and worth  dollars  If you do book on priceline be prepared to fight that  dollar charge Im sure they are still  doing it  
N => Excellent Value Of course not knowing what Hotel I was getting because I booked through Hotwire I was a little nervous  Id read some not so positive reviews about this hotel but I ided to see for myself We took the train into Montreal so our hotel was about a  minute walk from the station  minutes if you take the metro to McGill  The front lobby was clean and brightly lit and there was a gentleman at the front to offer advice on travelling around montreal  The front staff were pleasant and had no trouble speaking to me in English my french is quite poor I didnt want to embarrass myself by even trying our room was on the th floor and had  double beds My first thought was quotthis hotel has so much space and doesnt know what to do with itquot  My only complaint was the room smelled like it had been smoked in before but it wasnt a strong smell We didnt venture on to the balcony but there was quite a bit of space there as well  I had an excellent time at this hotel it was clean spacious and the staff were really friendly  
N => Convenient location We booked our room through Hotwire and after reading the reviews here were unsure of what to expect  The check in staff tried to put us in a smoking room but when we requested a non smokingshe quickly re assigned us to a non smoking room  Our room felt spacious and was clean although the TV could be updated  It must have been one of the reated rooms  The pool is an odd trapezoid shape which makes it unsuitable to swim laps  The location was convenient    within walking distance from the train station and also there is an underground connection to the metro  There are plenty of restaurants right around the corner but you would never know from asking the concierge  The concierge tries to steer you to the shopsrestaurants within the hotel  This is annoying  Free internet and breakfast are not included and wireless is not available in the room  But for the price we got we would probably go back  
N => Beware When booking this hotel they do not tell you that the parking is  per day and at that rate you expect some sort of security however our car was vandalized in hotel garage  The room was large which was nice as well as the bathroom  I would avoid using their hairdryers since it turned flaming hot sent sparks flying in my face and started smoking  We reported the car and hairdryer incidents and as far as the car they gave us back what we paid in parking  does not cover the damage  So BEWARE   bring your own hairdryer and either rent a car and make sure you have vandalism coverage or use taxis  I will seek another hotel if I ever ide to go back  
N => Average at best My husband and I booked a trip to Montreal ch   as we found a very inexpensive flight to Montreal and we booked this hotel through Hotwire which indicated this was a   hotel rating This hotel is a   at best  The room we were given was in need of reation  The carpet was worn the bathroom sink dripped the heat in the room didnt work correctly  The bed wasnt comfortable and only had  pillows  Most   hotels have at least  pillows without asking for them The food was overpriced and we ended up walking downtown for our meals  Being close and within walking distance to the downtown storesrestaurants was a huge plus  If you wanted to have internet access in your room it was day which I feel was on the high end for this service  However if you timed it right you could use one of the two computers they had in the business center for free When we checked out we were asked how our stay was and when I said okay I was asked why just ok  So I ended up saying we booked this hotel based on the   rating and she said we could have been upgraded to a better room Delta room for  per night  In my opinion if you book a   hotel the room should be a   and not have to pay additional money to get the   room  I guess this is where I probably wont book through Hotwire Overal I felt this hotel was average at best 
N => Bad Service The staff was very rude throughout the stay  We went on a family vacation and had several issues room not ready swimming pool closed room not cleaned properly  We actually found a bunch of condoms in the dresser and when we complained the staff told us that they would have to quotverifyquot the incident and get back to us bc they said that we could be making it up Not even an apology That obviously led me to wonder what other cleaning shortcuts were taken    The restaurant was ok  The food was ent   I do not recommend the breakfast buffet it is overpriced for what you get  Both times we ate there they were short staffed and would close a portion of the restauarant which resulted in a giant line to be seated  No valet service for parking You park your own car around the block  Overall I would stay somewhere else for the price  
N => Wonderful stay We stayed at the Delta on Monday ember   I had gotten the room for a very low  U S   taxes included on Priceline so was not expecting much  We were in fact delightfully surprised  I had e mailed the hotel the week before requesting a non smoking two bedded room on the sixth floor or higher but from previous reviews was doubtful that I would get what I wanted  We arrived at noon prepared to store our luggage for a while as check in wasn t until  p m  However not only were we given a room immediately but it was what I had asked for and more  It was a corner room one of the biggest I have seen very well appointed and spotless  I m attaching some photos Even though there is a busy road close to the hotel the traffic noise was barely audible so we spent a very relaxing night in a very comfortable bed  We appreciated the in room coffee making facilities and the morning paper  My husband had a good work out in the gym  The front desk staff were efficient and courteous and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  Getting back to Dorval next morning was easy with the Place des Arts metro station just a block away Highly recommended  
N => Not Up to Standards There was an emergency in the city so most of the area near the hotel was closed by the police  We later found out that cracks were found in the metro near our hotel so streets were closed to ensure safety  Once we were able to get access to our hotel it was very late  When we arrived it was near midnight  We checked in and went to our room  We were shocked at how small it was  My wife had stayed there before and told me that she had never had a room this small  air conditioning did not work  We arrived during a heat wave around midnight  We went to our room and noticed that the air conditioning was not working  We read the book the hotel provided regarding changing the temperature  We did as it said and still no air conditioning  We called the front desk who told us that they would send someone up to reset the ac  The man came said that the balcony door was not closed properly and that he felt cool air coming out of the vent located near the ceiling  The room was near  degrees  He said that there was no need to reset the ac  We waited   no ac  We left the room to wait for it to cool off  It never did  We spent the next day out returned back   still air conditioning not working  Called front desk again  My wife was threatening to sleep in the hall where it was cool  They sent up another man who RESET the air conditioner and it then worked  Big help since we lost almost  nights of sleep  I wish that the front desk had made a follow up call to make sure the problem was fixed the FIRST time  
N => Wonderful hotel Elegent clean well located  Stayed there for three days   Very spacious  Front k upgraded me to nd floor  Hugh room with a walkout k overlooks part of Downtown Montreal  Soft comtemporary o free daily newspaper candy water  Very clean and comfortable bed  Not the typical cheap and dirty blanket you will find in most other hotel  Attentative staff didnt get the chance to use the gym but looks nice and functional  located right in downtown  blocks walk to Metro  Willing to accommodate customers need to check out late Things I wish would be different Kinda pricy with no breakfast included  but hotels are not cheap in Montreal this time of year anyway  No free parking  Paid  day Gym closed too early at  PM 
N => Not bad at all We stayed here for  nights as part of a tour  It is a good hotel reasonably well located for shops and about a  minute walk to Old Montreal  The room was very spacious and well equipped and the buffet breakfast was good too  Not really a place to get excited about but clean and the service was good  They arranged for my wifes watch to be sent over to England when she left it behind  Overall we were disappointed with Montreal  The Son Et Lumiere events at Notre Dame Basilica are well worth a visit though  
N => Just say no to smoking rooms My gfs and I go up to Montreal almost once a month and stay at many different   hotels throughout the city usually booking thru a travel engine  Weve stayed at the Delta multiple times but this stay just wasnt up to par  First of all there were no non smoking rooms available for quotPriceline Customers quot Our agent liked this phrase alot and I wanted to point out that once we set foot inside we were quotDelta guestsquot but I kept my mouth shut  We ide to just take the room instead of paying more for a quotsuperiorquot non smoking room  Traipsing down the hall it as all flowery smelling so we had our fingers crossed   no such luck Upon opening the door we were assaulted by stale smoke    I dont know how a smoker could even spend  nights in there Back downstairs we went      more a night for the quotsuperiorquot room  Back upstairs we went      yes it smelled better thank god However I found very little quotsuperiorquot about it  It was slightly larger and had free internet which we didnt use       but the bathroom was a trainwreck  A drippy faucet the shower had a very slow drain and the toilet would hardly flush  Ugh  Not wanting to change rooms one more time we stuck it out but my the time we left we literally had to remove the top off of the back of the toilet and fix the plunger chain ourselves to flush itI emailed the hotel with my complaints but have had no reply whatsoever from their management  It ended being a lot more expensive than wed hoped  Adding the charge for our quotsuperiorquot room and two nights of parking self park not valet our bill with the  lines of different taxes came to more than  in addition to the amount we paid in advance on Priceline  Oh and room service for  of us was  burger and dessert no beverages  Just an FYI Happy travels 
N => What a great business place I recently got to travel alot more than usual and my co worker suggested to stay at the Delta Montreal for my trip  I am so happy I did this warm and welcome feeling when you arrive is just great  The hotel was sold out and I was lucky eneough to get a free upgrade to a Club Floor room What a clean and comfortable room  My check in was a little slow but now I became a Privilege member I should be able soon to get more upgrades Thanks to a great time at the bar tin was just a nice and great chatterA nice business placeDenis 
N => Cheap rate   great room I just got back from Montreal  I stayed  nites here and I paid nite thru priceline  Not knowing what I was goin to get when I arrived I was pleasently surprised  First off I asked to be put inthe premiere room there rooms have been remodeled these room general cost about  a nite  So instead of being on the lower floors I ended up on the th  When we got to the room everything was in great condition  We then called down to find out if they could send us up a down comforter that you would only get on the signature floors   Within a  mins knock on the door with the comforter  So i paid with tax for  nites got upgraded a room and the amenities of the the top floors not to bad  If i had any problems it would only be that the bathroom could have a bit better lighting but it was clean  And the fact that the smoke detectors are too close to the bathroom if you dont close the bathroom room and the steam gets out the alarm will go off  Other wise A place to stay the staff is very accomidating  Do not be afraid to stay here its a great place  And remember dont be afraid to ask for things youll be surprised what you will get  
N => Terrible Hotel  We booked this hotel thru the Hotwire website prior to our weekend trip usd per night The service room amp food were horrible  They claim our room was quotrecently reatedquot   the light was falling off the wall the hallways had food outside the rooms for nearly  hours  The carpet was filthy and wallpaper peeling off the wall On the last day we were trapped on our floor for  minutes as the lifts were outta service  We ended up calling the central reservations number as the reception did not pick up the phone This place is a jokeDuring the quothappy hourquot they serve no alcohol which they allude too when you check in and serve gross unedible food thats been sitting around for hours Dont book this hotel even if its cheapJ  
N => insect infestation Possibly the worst hotel experience of my life  We found our room to be infested with thousands of tiny green insects thast BITE  Upon notifying the reception our complaint was dismissed as our fault for opening the balcony doors hwere the insects apparently breed in a puddle of rainwater  After taking multiple digital photos and showing them downstairs we were moved to a different room  hours later  Will never saty at a delta again  
N => Good location for business and tourism This was my first trip to Montreal and I did not know anything about the city except the address of the company I went to visit  I booked the Delta because of its location  I found it to be close to downtown and to Old Montreal and was able to walk anywhere I needed to go  I stayed on the th floor  the upper floors have been reated and it looked like the lower levels were quotin processquot  Stay on one of the top  or  floors of  if possible  Staff was polite but not overly warm room service was prompt and reasonably priced compared to Chicago and other large US cities the room was clean and the view was great  Room had high speed internet connection it was very easy to connect  I would stay there again on future trips  
N => Just another Hotel Went to Montreal for a romantic getaway  The hotel was average did stay in the upper suits rd floor Room was clean but not as big as they made it out to be  Mini bar and snacks were way too pricey to use and the fridge was warm  Hotel is in a great central location so you can walk to anything downtown which is good because driving in Montreal can be tricky  Hotel garage was over priced to me and very tight to drive in  Spa at hotel was nice but dont waste your time on pedicures  Breakfast was good didnt eat dinner at hotel  Was not impressed with the elevators three of them yet wait time was frustrating at times seemed like only one worked  Would stay there again  
N => Great Location I was visiting a friend in Montreal and we were finding the hotels to be very expensive  We rolled the dice and found a hotel on Hotwire for  US a night  The hotel turned out to be Delta Montreal  I immediately came to TripAdvisor to check out the comments and was a little worried  I called the hotel and requested a double bed and was told all that was available was a King  The girl said she would put it in my file that I would like a double and if one became available they would assign it to me  When we arrived at the hotel the gentleman that registered us was very nice and said that I got a double bed yea  When I got to the room I was very pleasantly surprised  Two double beds a balconyand very large room  It had a desk two chairs table dresser and lots of room to move around  The room was clean the beds comfy and the staff was nice  We had NO problems parking in the underground parking at the hotel except it was  a day I would definately recommend this hotel 
N => A much better stay than the Hotel Champ De s We booked this hotel on hotwire for   I got an executive suite with a sitting area large bathroom dressing room king size bed and balcony  Quite obviously the value was incredible The bed was comfortable and the pillows were excellent plump and soft The room was very clean and the bathroom had wonderful toiletry samples The balcony was a nice quotextraquot since the weather was beautiful but the view from the balcony was not anything to get excited about    just views of close by office buildings The elevators are slow but very sturdy and clean The staff is extremely friendly and very accomodating Parking is not free which I was disappointed by  It was  per night but since I got the room so cheap I was not upset The hallways smelled of smoke but the room smelled fresh We stayed at the Hotel Champ de s the night before which I would not recommend to my worst enemy and this was a very refreshing relaxing stay after my horrible night before  
N => Spa review Im writing this review of the spa at the Delta Montreal  as I noticed there was not much on the other reviews  I wanted to book a group spa day in Montreal but my group was only available on Canada Day   most spas in the city were closed for the holiday  Also the Jazz Festival was being held in Montreal the same weekend so lots of tourists were in town booking restaurants amp spas Appointment There is no spa menu on the Delta Montreal website  the only reason I knew the spa was there was from a past stay  I called the spa and asked them info about the spa and to send me a brochure amp price list   person who answered the phone was very informative and friendly  However they would not block the afternoon until I received all the requests from my group though they took my name and phone   for reference when I called back  I gathered my groups appointment requests and called the spa directly to schedule the appointments  no problems there Staff Receptionist is friendly but often overwhelmed as guests come into the spa asking questions and spa go ers rush to and from their treatments through the reception area  Estheticians were very accommodating as well no snobbery here Spa layout Small spa lounge is located toward the back of the spa so each time a treatment is complete you would have to walk past all the treatment rooms to get there  I had no problem during my hot stone massage but others commented that the doors were not soundproof and talking from guests amp staff are heard throughout what is supposed to be a relaxing treatment even when not very loud  Our group pretty much took over the spa so if I were another spa guest I would have been annoyed  Nail salon area is across the hall and pool is down the hall all in a open area that hotel guests can wander through  If you are somewhat self conscious in a robe moving between the areas that would be a problem  Reception area is busy amp small with guests amp staff moving through and not enough chairs  We were also given access to the pool amp fitness center down the hall   the pool amp jacuzzi was indoor and ok   just not too well orated  Locker rooms were kind of old looking and definitely not very spa like Spa treatments I had a wonderful hot stone massage great esthetician  One person in my group commented on how cold the treatment room was but I didnt notice bc of the heat from the stones  I also had a pedicure  I was stuck in a corner of a small room across the hall  The pedicurist was very nice   but she did not have all her tools in one place and was constantly getting up to find them  The pedicure itself was fair but no spa chair   I was sitting on a regular chair while my pedicurist was on the floor  Not sure if she was new or less trained the pedicure did not last long after the day Value Spa treatments are very inexpensive compared to the US  My hot stone massage would have cost twice as much in the States  Nail amp other salon treatments are about the same price as other spas but I would say overpriced for what I received  I would have just gotten the massage had I toured the spa area prior to booking but I was booking from out of town  Some of the group wanted more spa treatments than others so timing was a little off  some of us had more quotdowntimequot than we had intended  Free snacks in the lounge amp access to pool was a nice add to the treatments Ive been to other hotels that charge for these Pros Friendly staff snacks available nice massage rooms access to pool amp locker roomCons Small spa lounge so so nail saloerall to me a bargain but dont expect a  star spa  
N => Hummer Stolen in Lot Be Careful We arrived at the Delta on Thursday and the first thing we noticed was the faint smell of smoke in the hallways  We overlooked that seeing that we were in Canada  Everything was good until Saturday night when there was a wedding that took place right below our room on the nd floor  The music was blasting and after complaining three times we were told that the room was rented to the wedding party until am and there was nothing they can do about it  We were offered to move to a different room but who wants to pack their stuff up at  AM to sleep somewhere else  The joy comes Sun morning when we go to leave and our Hummer H is simply gone form the parking lot  We were told that it is possible for anyone to purchase a ticket for parking in the ramp so anyone can actually take your car out without being suspicious  The police took  min to come and didnt even investigate  I believe it was an inside job  Waiting to hear from hotel  Onstar system did not work so these people are professionals since there was no evidence of a breakin  The service for the most part was good and the location is good but BE ST  DO NOT PARK CAR HERE even though it is underneath the hotel and seems safe  For  a day to park I expect more than sorry your truck is gone and we have no answers because there is no security watching the parking lot  
N => total wipe out well it started with the reservations   quot yes of course we have high chairs for your little ones we can arrange to have one put in your room before you arrivequotwell not only was there no high chair in the room for my ten month old dhter the hotel did not even have them available for anyonethe rooms and hallways still smell like they have just been smoked in even though smoking is no longer allowed the hotel tuck shop    I had just come back from the pool  way too cold and I stopped by the tuck shop for some goods  The bill came to   I only had a  and she gave me that look of quot nope its   thank you   so I fished around in the pocket of my swim trunks still wet and found   and I said that that was all I had     she then asked me if I had a card a bank card or credit card  I could not believe her     for a measley   youre not gonna let me off  I just paid   a night to stay in this hotel and youre gonna yank me for     unbelievable     at this point another hotel guest offered to give me the   and you know what    the shop girl ignored the other guest and asked me three more times if I had a bank card orcredit card        I will never stay at a Delta hotel anywhere ever again and I will always suggest to anyone who asks to do the same  I found the staff to be very insincere with their comments and I thought that they were most likely not happy with their jobs      I am not the kind of folk to be nasty and I am a pretty reasonable person and a very easy guest to have stay in a hotel very low maintenance      this experience was simply shocking  I hope youre experiences do not match mine  
N => Great place to stay I booked our room at the Delta Montreal over the phone about a week before our arrival  There were four of us and we were in a delta room with  double beds  Front desk was very nice and were helpful by giving us maps to places we needed to go  The room was very clean very spacious and had a great balcony  I would definetly stay here again  
N => Great little hotel with personality  Booked a blind hotel room on Hotwire for  and got this hotel  After reading reviews I was expecting an avg place  I got much more  GREAT staff friendly This hotel is obviously very gay friendly which suited me  My room had a ent little standing balcony could have used a chair or two but it was smallish overlooking Sherbrooke Street  Nice  Bathroom was large and well appointed  My bed was comfy  Nothing was missing  High Speed inernet was easy enough to use  Seemed the place was super clean and freshly orated  Very pleasant one night stay   should have stayed there the whole time as I was disappointed at every other place I stayed for the next  nights  Good job Delta Montreal 
N => Comfortable reasonable and well located The hotel is very well located   minute walk to the St DenisRue Prince Arthur restaurant area   minute walk to McGill University and to the edge of Mont Royal Park   minutes or so to Vieux Montreal  The staff is very polite and helpful  I had quite a bit of trouble and questions to get my dhters laptop hooked up to the internet and they were very indulgent  Parking under the hotel    I would have liked to have been able to drop my bags in front before heading down rather than having to park and lug them up myself  Had I asked I might have been able to but the concierge told me to do that and I did  Nice pool and exercise room  Nice restaurant and bistro though a little pricey and esoteric for me with my kids  But in Montreal you dont have to go far to find a suitable place to eat Would stay again  
N => Good and Bad I had expected this hotel to be a great stay  The Main lobby is beautiful however upon arrival we were told the hotel was over booked due to a wedding and  of us being students where have to stay in a one bed hotel room  I had called the night before and checked our booking for a room with to beds and NO SMOKING The room had definitly been smoked in previous to our arrival  We complained and complained and the best they could do for us was give us two cotts and the use of a ozone machine which did infact get rid of the smell  The next day we were bumped up to a room on the th floor which was big and spacious with no complaints except for the pattio which you couldnt even sit out on  Our stay there after was nice and the manager had given us   off our first nigth stay  Ok hotel worth the money but complain complain complain and you will get more then you payed for 
N => Not worth the money stay elsewhere My husband and I stayed at the Delta Montreal in mid e for a few days  When we arrived there was no one there to greet us or take our bags  The valet was no where to be seen  We went in to the front desk to check in which was also very bad experience  Only one clerk and a long line  We had reserved a non smoking king size room over the phone  Upon check in at  pm we were informed there were no king rooms available keep in mind check in begins at pm  We were told that there are king sized rooms on the upper floors that we could have for an additional  per night  What a joke Rather than look for another hotel we took the room with two double beds and ided to live with it  Big mistake as things only got worse  The rooms were average at best  We walked onto the balcony only to discover cigar butts all over  After calling downstairs I was informed that they do not clean the balconies after each guest checks out  They did send someone up fairly quickly to sweep them up  The beds were extremely small and uncomfortable  No good view  Furniture rather shabby and the tub would not turn completely off  Several times we tried pressing the valet button on the phone and were given the wrong extension each time  There were also problems with the valet service the entire length of our stay  Once we waited  minutes only to discover no one went to get the car and they didnt realize we had called down to get it  When coming back at pm in the evening no valet was anywhere to be found and we had to wait  minutes while they called him  Not at all what you expect for  parking per night  The hotel does have a nice fitness facility but the jacuzzi was not operating properly jets very weak  We even considered ending our vacation a day sooner  After several complaints to manager we were upgraded the final night of our stay into a club room on the higher floors  This room was what I would have expected all rooms there should have been like  The breakfast buffet was one of the finer things about the hotel  Overall for the price you pay this is not a four star hotel  It should be classified closer to  stars  I would definetly not go back and would caution anyone thinking of staying there  
N => Good location OK price clean room Was staying at the Delta Montreal during the Jazz festival and if youre there for the festival you cant get much closer than this hotel without the noise interferring with you  Its just about  blocks away  The noise did not penetrate our room to the point of being annoying during the day assuming noise is an issue for you  Assuming youre not there for the festival this hotel is still in a nice location  My friends and I were able to walk to most of the attractions i e  Notre Dame Basilica Chinatown old Montreal within reasonable amount of time  Its also located very close to a Metro station for your convenience Since we just so happen to stay there during the Jazz festival they did jack up the price and so its hard for me to say if the rates are fare When we first arrived the reception desk claimed that they had no non smoking rooms as we requested so we were placed in a smoking room  The receptionist also said that if the smell was too much for us she can change our rooms around noon of that day when a non smoking room will free up  Not really sure if this happened because we arrived the next morning of the day were suppose to check in so be they assumed that we werent coming or just poor management  Make a long story short the smell was strong and by pm yes there was a delay of an hour getting a new room we were in a non smoking room  To me that was adequately handled although upgrading us if there was any free rooms    would have made me a much happier reviewer Our non smoking Delta room located on the nd floor next to the Exit door I believe it was Room  was nice and clean and spacious  No problems with the bathroom or AC My only complain about the hotel actually has to do with the garage  First off parking is an extra  per day  The garage is located under the hotel with if I recall correctly  levels of parking  Problem we had was with the ticketing system and how we were suppose to use the hotel given ticket to get into and out of the parking garage  The receptionist tried to explain to me how it works but I was still confused and it seemed to me she wasnt too inclined to try and make me understand how its suppose to operate  In  occasions we had to intercom the ticketing station to had them open the gates for us to pass because for some reason it just wasnt recognizing our ticket  Another thing to note is that the garages elevator does not connect directly to the hotels floors you need to go into the lobby and change to a different set of elevators to get to your room no biggie though The pool is a ent size but there was a lot of chlorine in it though thats better than not enough wearing swimming goggles are strongly advised  And we also found out that the jacuzzi was being cleaned Sun  night so come Mon  morning it wasnt operational till noon time Finally while we were staying there there was reations going on in the hotel lobby as well as construction going on right next to the hotel in front of the Holiday Inn  While we didnt hear any noise coming from the lobby reations there was definitely noise coming from the construction site  
N => Worst hotel stay ever We checked into the Delta and the reception staff was less than willing to provide information to us  I asked them about their Delta kids program and the person I spoke with basically shrugged and didnt respond  After we checked in my husband took the children swimming in the pool  When the kids returned to the room to take a shower we realized that there was no hot water in our room  Remember that this was minus  degrees weather outside so the kids had to wait in their wet bathing suits while I spoke with reception  The not so friendly reception staff informed me that theyre having problems with the hot water and someone is working on it  I asked why they didnt inform me of this when I checked in  I would not have stayed if they had told me that  They did not do anything about it until I got angry and inform them that I will be suing their management if my kids got sick while waiting for them to rectify the situation  Then their manager appeared and lo and behold they were able to find a room with hot water in it  It appeared that they were untruthful when telling me that theres no hot water in the whole building This was definitely the worst service Ive ever received at a big hotel chain such as the Delta  
N => What we expected We requested a non smoking premier room but none were available on check in  Were upgraded to the deluxe room still smoking  Offered to change the next night but we didnt bother  Hotel is in a good location close to Ste  Catherine Metro etc  One big plus was free high speed internet  Room was always cleaned promptly on our exit and staff were generally friendly  Got a pretty good price of around  CAD tax in off expedia so we were generally pleased  
N => Nothing to rave about This property is pretty blah but a good value for  bucks or so  I would not want to pay any more than  Lobby not impressive and not a lot of room to park when you check in Make sure you ask for a room with a new bed I didnt and my back paid dearly for it the next day  However when I asked to switch rooms it was not a problem at all Staff were polite and friendly food from room service terribly expensive  
N => Good clean hotel I thought this hotel was worth the money we spent on it  The room was large and very clean and the service was very good  Unfortunately the king sized bed we slept on was hard and uncomfortable which  be a problem for those who arent used to it  Overall a ent hotel for a   or  star rating  
N => Just okay not great Just came back from a three night stay at the Delta Montreal  First time  The hotel was okay but was not what I would expect for a  star hotel  Not plush  Staff was pleasant  Price was a bit high for the quality of the room  Wallpaper looked tired and was coming off in spots  Room was nice size with king bed  Having the balcony was a great feature  Bathroom was spacious  One day pool area was out of guest towels  That was disappointing  I had to use paper towels to dry off after shower I didnt want to go back up to my room to get towels  Seems like those servicing the spa could have requested bath towels temporarily until pool towels were available  Whirlpool jets did not function well  There  be other hotels at lower price with similar features that might be just as good and closer to Old Montreal festival area on St  Denis parts of Ste Catherine and waterfront  It is centrally located downtown but most of our exploring was south and east of the center of downtown  Would probably stay elsewhere next time  
N => The Delta french style We stayed at the Delta for a cold week in uary   When we got to our room I believe it was on the th floor the hot water was not working and you could see this was a problem as it was about   degrees Celsius outside  They moved us up to a higher floor and we found out that the room was an quotupgradequot  It included free internet a bath robe a prettier picture on the wall nicer sheets a nice desk and chair etc  and we were pretty happy  Then the hot water would not work again they called up maintance about   times to fix it but the entire buildings water was only quotluke warmquot  We tried to open the balcony door but they were all sealed shut and the maintance man had to come up and open it for us  The staff was nice but the maid walked in on us    u know  Overall the price was unbeatable so we cant complain  We stayed a total of  days  The parking is  a day  The staff tried their best to help us  We complained to management about the water and they gave us a nice coupon for our next stay so we have to returnDont go there if you are picky unless you get the higher floors  
N => Great way to end our trip  
N => Not a  star hotel  
N => Delta Montreal was average  
N => Not what your reviews said  
N => Il migliore in assoluto tra tutti quelli in cui ho alloggiato in Canada   
N => We were so disappointed We were very disappointed with our visit to the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth  The hotel was on strike   which we were not made aware of when booking our hotel stay  My husband and I were away for a romantic anniversary weekend and were deeply disappointed to find out that the staff was bare bones the pool sauna hot tub and fitness centre were all closed there was no room service all the bars and restaurants in the hotel were closed and there was no maid service  They refused to give us our money back and when we were shown to our room it was the tiniest hotel room Id ever been in Needless to say all of this affected our romantic weekend  We wont be staying there again  
N => oth Wedding Anniversary What a gorgeous hotel We have stayed here so many times we can no longer count and each time it is exquisite  I have to say that reading some negative comments about the cleanliness during the strike labour disruption while we were there I never found a problem  Our room was made up every day with clean towels and things put away  We actually asked them not to clean up as we knew how hard they were working  Upon our arrival we had a plate of little petit fours waiting in our room  How nice was that even during labour disruptions Also the staff in the Montrealis restaurant each morning couldnt have been kinder  In fact I saw someone drinking cafe au lait and asked if I could buy  bowls from them and they allowed me to  Also on our last day at the hotel we spoke with the cleaning staff in our room and  minutes later arrived a tray with Baileys  glasses  bottles of water and again a carousel of tiny baked goods wishing us happy th anniversary  We have nothing but WONDERFUL things to say about this hotel and hope to be back soon 
N => Not Good enough to be a Fairmont I understand when you have labor issues that quality of service might rease but the only person i was impressed with during my stay was the concierge  The front desk people were abrupt and due to the strike my room was not cleaned during my stay  It also was evident the cleaning stay did not clean the room based on basic standards because there was a candy wrapper under the bed and a bloody napkin under the end table    the view of Mont Royal was amazing but i do not think i would stay there again  
N => Not Up To Fairmont Standards A conference took me to Montreal on business mid tember We knew that they were in the middle of a strike but ided to stay there because we were so excited to be staying at a Fairmont property  We managed just fine during the strike even with no real housekeeping for six days  Towels and washcloths were stacked on tables on each floor  They did come in to make the bed a couple of days  No sheets were changed  Regardless of the strike I would have been disappointed in this property  It is very dated and the rooms are in need of a major reation  Dark drab and very very small rooms for such a high room price  It did not compare to the Fairmont properties that I have stayed at in the U S  The location is indeed good  The staff was doing everything they could to make up for the strike  Next visit I would definitely stay somewhere else as I heard many comments from others at this conference that they were thrilled with their hotels    and there are many great choices in Montreal  
N => Not so much Stayed at the Fairmont in the midst of the hotel strike so this review might be a little tainted  All workers were on strike and the management was trying to fill in  Room was clean at check in but never cleaned again  When I called for towels shampoo coffee etc  it was brought to the room  The pool was closed as were the restaurants and almost everything else  We bought tickets for the hop on hop off tour whick we really liked at the desk and the women told us to be at the door at  and we would be picked up and taken to the start of the tour  Was there at  bus came at  and drove  blocks and dropped us off  He said the next bus would be there at  as we had missed the   A wasted  minutes as we would have just walked the  blocks over to the start of the tour and cht the   Arrival at the hotel is very confusing as you can not drop your luggage off at the door on street level  They direct you to an underground garage where you park  Since the valets were on strike there were no luggage racks and you just unloaded your luggage dragged it almost a city block to an elevator that took you to the main floor of the hotel  Then you had to transfer all your luggage to a erate elevator to get to your room  We were exhausted and frustrated by the time we finaly got our key and went to the room  Room was just okay  Dirty carpet coffee pot that didnt work very tiny bathroom and an outdated television  The bed and pillows were wonderful Location was great but I would er pick this hotel to stay in again  First time I have ever been disappointed with a Fairmont  
N => arrived just as strike took its toll We arrived on Tuesday ust th and were warned upon checking in that there might be some quotsporadicquot problems with service due to the labor strike  We were told the rooms would be made up and if we found ours unmade to please call  The restaurant was open and we were told the pool would be open most of the time too  Had a delightful high tea to celebrate our arrival in Montreal delicious tea and scones  We never had any service to our rooms after that though  We were woken up by loud whistling and louder music as striking workers gathered on the street directly below our room which was on floor   I read below that someone who stayed on the GOld floor had no disruption to their service but we did not find that unfortunately  Management were friendly but what can you do if the staff walk out I am sympathetic to the striking workers too but my husband is annoyed that even though he asked if anything quotunusualquot was going on at the hotel like construction or anything else that could disrupt our stay when he booked about ten days in advance he was given no warning  The real problem with booking a family holiday with young kids where there is no room service and the restaurants are closed which happened about two hours after our check in and where they dont warn you this is likely is the jetlagged kids get hungry late at night and there is no food and no safe comfortable way to feed them  I ended up luckily finding an open place in the train station below the hotel at  PM  The Fairmont management ided to open one restaurant for breakfast buffet only for a limited period in the morning the next day and did not post or bother informing guests in rooms so we missed it  They did offer a free in room movie we got a message on our room phone that we were entitled to a free film which is not much compensation when there is no service in the room and the carpets everywhere are getting dirtier and dirtier  The people who stayed on duty were very nice but really there was little they could do to make the stay comfortable  We felt the hotel management were not up front when we arrived and really downplayed the possibility of serious disruption to hotel services  Two days later we moved to a different hotel in Montreal  A word of warning Fairmont is not the only hotel affected by this strike  Several other chains are too so if you book in Montreal make sure the strike has ended or research your choice carefully before you book  
N => be next time My family of three stayed at the Queen Elizabeth for one night and our experience was so so  The good things location is close to Old Montrealunderground city subway amp Science Centre  The bad things The hotel workers union was on strike travel agent did not know so the staff was hit or miss  Room service took well over an hour forget speaking to the concierge and housekeeping was lacking Our double room was small  There were crumbs on our beddesk chair and the telephone was a mess  But it was only for one night so we delt with it  My dhter was disappointed with the poolsmallsalt water and the floor around the pool was a health hazard  The buffet breakfast was good and it was included in our rate  We would like to stay in Montreal again be at the Ritz  
N => A charmer We stayed at The Queen for six days attending a conference and thought the hotel was really quite lovely  Because they had some work stoppage the service was not up to speed although management did try very hard to make our stay a positive one  The room was very nice with a good view and quite adequate in size  Fitness center was top notch too  Plenty of restaurants near by and a basilica across the street  All in all a very nice stay  
N => Very disappointed This was not at all what we had expected it would be  Upon our arrival we were advised that the hotel was in the midst of a labor strike so that there were very few services available   even though we had paid for quotGoldquot level service   whatever that was supposed to mean  When we realized that we had paid for services which were totally unavailable we requested a room change and were moved to the st floor  Clearly any reations that this hotel  have begun have not gotten up there  The carpet was an interesting shade of pink and I was not comfortable walking around without flip flops  The curtains and bed cover were very obviously remnants from the s  The furniture was beat up and tired looking  Not at all a comfortable place to stay and if you are in Montreal to see the sites I would not recommend at all  It is not close enough to anything to make this tired place worth the stay  
N => Very Nice Hotel is very conveniently located and walking distance to old Montreal  Given the reputation of this hotel I was a bit disappointed  The carpet in my room and in the elevator lobby on my floor th were buckled and needed to be stretched  It would have been easy to trip  I also found the room to be quite warm in spite of the ac being on Everything was clean but just not the calibre that I expected  My expectations were just too high I think  
N => Not what it used to be As a business traveller I used to stay at the at the Fairmont all the time  This is now the second time in a row at the Queen Elizabeth where I had to change room in the middle of the night  Trying it again this time the room was quiet but an alarm in an empty room next to mine woke us up at am  The pool downstairs was full with a group of bikers and there was a dirt ring of  cms around the jacuzzi  Our diner last night with room service was mixed up and therefore was mn late and at breakfast the coffee never was served before we left    Finally as I walked to my room tonight security was on the floor as there were guests smoking swearing in our of the rooms    The hotel seems ripe for party goers not for business travelers or families    avoid if you are in either situations  
N => Not what I expected    Stayed over for one night   business trip  I stayed on the th floor  It was not what I expected  One out of four lamps worked because of burnt out light bulbs  Office space was too small  The desk was tiny and positioned in an odd way that did not allow you to watch TV even thou the TV was pulled out and slightly rotated  The or in the room was old and stale  The ble bathroom felt like it was designed for a tiny person  The sink was small with hardly any counter top space  I was truly expecting more out of this hotel since it holds the quotFairmontquot name  I was quite disappointed The good thing about this hotel was the location  
N => Gold Service   Nice but the rooms are very small My wife and I booked into the Fairmont Gold section of the hotel on the th Floor  The room cost around  for one night  The service was very good however the room was ridiculously small with a bathroom that was tucked away like it was a closet  The room was a suite and was meant to be one of the bigger rooms  I have stayed in larger rooms in a travel lodge  The four poster bed was nice however the television was placed in such a location that from one side of the bed you couldnt watch it as the bed post was in the way  A maid walked into the room when we were in there didnt even knock  I was glad to leave the hotel to be honest and wouldnt stay there again  
N => Great Location We stayed at the Fairmont hotel for  nights and found that it was in a great location  We went in summer so walking everywhere was no problem  Its only a  minute walk to Saint catherine st and about a  min walk to the old town  The staff were friendly and helped get us around  We never ordered room service because there were plenty of places to eat around town  Breakfast was great  Would recommend staying there if you want to be central to everything  
N => Room Service Forgot About Us I feel I must state that at the time of my trip I was working for a sister company of Fairmont and booked this hotel at the employee rate of approximately   Normally this wouldnt matter but the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth made me feel like I wasnt worthy of staying in their hotel because of the rate I was paying and where I work  With that said Ill give a quick recap of my trip My husband and I took the train in from Toronto on the weekend of ember   to celebrate an anniversary  The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect for those travelling by train  Our train arrived around midnight and it was great to just go on upstairs to the lobby  Check in was a bit slow but there were quite a few people checking in at the time so thats understandable  We got to our room and we werent overly impressed or unimpressed  It was just a room  I agree that the bathroom was a little tight but it didnt really bother us much When we got checked in and got settled we called room service to see if they were still open and taking orders  They were so we placed an order  After  hours on a train without a ent meal we were quite hungry We were told it would be about a  minute wait and that they were quite busy  Not a problem thats how long it takes a pizza to get delievered so we waited  An hour or so goes by and I make a call to see how much longer itll be  I got snapped at on the phone that they were busy and it would be up soon  After waiting another hour  we gave up and went to bed too tired to really care at this point The next morning I went to the front desk to complain  Now I must say this I am not normally a complainer in hotels or restaurants I can probably count on one hand the amount of times Ive quotcomplainedquot about something but I felt the staff needed to know this oversite  Working in hotels myself I know I hate it when I get comment cards back from people with all these complaints and not once did they say anything to the front desk in order to get the complaint rectified or compensated  When I mentioned it to the girl at the desk she brought up my reservation and made a face  She then said quotWell you work in a hotel  You should know how it is quot I couldnt believe shed say that I would never ever say that to a guest who was paying an employee rate  Yes I quotknow how it isquot  I understand that room service gets busy but they didnt even bother to come or call us to let us know when theyd be coming  After talking with her some more I managed to get a free breakfast for that morning for both me and my husband but I was still not impressed with the way she handled the issue The rest of our stay was very nice  We loved the location of the hotel  Being that we were there in ember it was very cold and snowy so it was nice to walk around and shop underground  After exploring for a bit we went back to the hotel to drop off our coats and went shopping without them which was nice We didnt eat dinner in the restaurant as we had dinner at a local friends house so I cant comment on that  Breakfast was fine All in all we had a ent time in Montreal  We would love to go back preferably in the summer months and stay longer two nights just doesnt cut it when you arrive at am the first night and leave at am the last day but would I stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth again No I wouldnt  be if I were paying the full rate I wouldve been treated like an actual guest but I believe that hotels should treat all of their guests equally regardless of how much they are paying per night  
N => Beware of Valet Service I stayed at this Hotel in ober for  nights and was very disappointed with all aspects of my stay  First of all the room I had was old and not reated  The bedspread and mattress were old the carpet was soiled and the bathroom dreadful  On top of all this I had parked my car using the hotel valet service and discovered that my Ipod was missing from my vehicle  When I reported this incident to the hotel they were quick to brush off all responsibility to the hotel parking lot lease holder  I was extremely disappointed with the way the hotel management handled the entire situation  Bottom line they didnt care which made matters worst If travelling to Montreal I strongly suggest you stay elsewhere  
N => Service exists at reasonable cost Fairmont hotels have always had impeccable service but at a premium cost  The Queen Elizabeth in downtown Montreal breaks that tradition  My recent stay there was as expected   no detail was too small but the price was well under the norm for the area I had a standard room that was in the quotrefurbishedquot category  It was cozy but the bright colors and furnishings were well suited to the room to make it seem larger than it was The service could not have been better  In fact I needed a quick beard trim to keep from looking like a goat  My trimer was dead so I went down to ask the belman where I could get a couple batteries at am  He told me to wait a minute while he picked up the phone  I was surprised when about  minutes later another bellman shows up with the batteries   at no chargeYes Im going back to Montreal and yes I will return to te Fairmont  
N => Wonderful stay We arrived at the Fairmont exhausted after a full day of work and travel  The agent at the desk was extremely helpful and accommodating to our request  After a couple minutes wait for her to accomodate our request she felt she had delayed us and offered us complimentary breakfast What a welcome The hotel was very classy and clean staff was wonderful and friendly  We stayed during the holiday weekend so be not as hectic with conventions  The underground was nice even though it was closed for Labor day  Very convenient to metro Our visit to Montreal was superb the highlight was the wonderful place to come back to everynight for rest  I also took advantage of the well equipped gym and saw many people enjoying the pool  
N => Not as good as my previous stay I stayed for one night recently my nd stay within a half year  I love getting off the train and taking the escalator directly into the hotel I was given a Fairmont rd floor room overlooking a construction area with a scaffolding platform lift resting just outside my window  As well empty pop bottles and water bottles dirty work gloves and socks  sitting in thick piles of dirt and dust littered the terraced area outside the window  I asked for a room in which I could open the window without getting dust blowing in the room and was courteously moved  Still I was amazed that this room was even being offered to guests at Cnight  In my new room I was unable to set the alarm clock the alarm hour button didnt work only the minute button so I could only choose a time from  through  as my wake up time but the wake up call was prompt  Breakfast was excellent and room service was fine  But my shoes were not delivered at am as indicated  I waited awhile then called down around   My shoes arrived at around am  All in all my experience was adequate but not as good as Id hoped  I just LOVE the location and the food is good but Im seriously considering going back to the Westin  Sigh 
N => Avoiding the convention delegates We spent a week here for our th wedding anniversary  Our celebration dinner at the Beaver Club was excellent   and it was nice to have a cake made for us as well as the souvenir photo  Staff were great throughout the stay  The room was well designed and comfortable  The location is superb as other guests have written   we definitely eschewed the hotel breakfast for the fantastic quotDeli Planetquot down in the food halls under the hotel  Our day trip to Quebec was very good and coming home on a train walking a few steps and into a lift back to the hotel was a very relaxed end to the day But the hotel does take thousands of convention delegates and I have to say some of them were pretty obnoxious  We wanted to patronise the bar when the singerguitarist was on   he was excellent but drowned out by boorish delegates who monopolise the lobby bar etc  The hotel management might want to think about putting very discreetpolite  i e  very Canadian  notices in the lifts reminding guests to respect other guests desire to sleep  We were woken several timesby delegates shouting along corridors putting TVs on full blast at  am and generally behaving as though the entire building were theirs during their conference  
N => Beautiful Hotel Outstanding Service Spent two days weekend nights at the hotel with two adults and two young children The room was very clean and furnishing were contemporary and showed no wear  Only complaint was that the room we stayed Fairmont Room was small although we knew this going in due to the hotel website displaying the square footage of each room category online  Larger room options are available  High speed internet was direct connect only a plug was already provided in the room  If I had been traveling alone on business and more likely to have spent hours on the laptop I would have preferred that wireless was available  TV was of the  inch picture tube variety  I know that some travelers are becoming accustomed to larger PlasmaLCD HD TVs at higher end hotels Location was great with easy access to the Underground City and the Metro  Fortunately we had warm weather and got to spend most of our time outside  As the hotel is about the main railroad station in Montreal there were surprisingly strong and reasonably priced food options at Les Halles de la Gare a collection of food vendors  Les Halles were only a two elevator side away from the room One to go from the room to the lobby and then to switch to a nd elevator located at the same elevator band to go to Les Halles  In all you could from your room to the Les Halles in about  minutes Service was consistently excellent Concierge was helpful in attempting to locate a couple items that we had forgotten at home Upon departure bellhop was at our door within  minutes of ring down for assistance Housekeeping was solid although they did replace all of our towels even though we had hung a couple for re use Since we were traveling with young children and did not want to take cabs no car seats we used the valet parking frequently  They consistently had our car for us in seconds and were always polite in asking if we needed directions Late night room service was solid but unexceptional  Ordered late night table dhote sandwich cup of soup ice cream bar which at C was quite reasonable  A side of cake was an additional C  
N => Try to avoid   Many better choices in Montreal We checked in a room in poor conditions where we were disturbed untill late in the night drunk teens partying  I reported the noise situation and informed the hotel manager of the poor condition of the room nothing was done to rectify the situation or compensate us for the disturbance   We were actually told the management apologized for the inconvenience but it was not in fact their fault as this was a busy weekend and given the fact that the hotel had a lot of corridors with over  stories it was accordingly difficult to monitor the property properly and that I should call the front desk next time I was disturbed in the middle of the night  When we complained about our overall experience at the check out the front desk attendant offered us a free night stay to avoid any embarrassment from a crowded lobby of customers  As youll guess this offer was not valid anymore once we left the promises  
N => Another fantastic Fairmont Experience For such a large hotel I was blown away  I have stayed in Fairmonts from coast to coast as well as Hawaii and they never seem to disappoint  On to the Montreal Fairmont Queen Elizabeth  Service here is excellent EXCELLENT  The other positive reviews are bang on the money Some back story here My wife and I wanted to get away for our anniversary  We took VIA RAIL from Toronto to Montreal  Whats great with this set up is that you can walk underground from the train to the lobby of this hotel without going outside  From the time we left the train to checking into our room could not have been more than  or  minutes The hotel is centrally located in downtown Montreal  Hundreds of shops restaurants boutiques are just a stones throw away  Its a     minute walk to old Montreal  Subway be  minutes  Perfect The room was great  Very comfy  Feather pillows comfortable bed well maintained room  We did not eat at the hotel theres just so many other places in Montreal but I plan to give the hotels  star Beaver Club a chance the next time we go there it looked wonderful  The hotel also has a family restaurant with bar plus another bar next to the Beaver Club  Full work out room with small pool and hot tub couldnt get into the pool too many people but the hot tub was great Some downsides change rooms for the health club needs a serious upgrade need to update those antiquated lockers  Steam room not hot enough no controls to adjust  And the rooms bathrooms are a tad on the small side not much place to put your stuff   nothing that would keep me away as these are pretty minor observations  TV worked great fully stocked mini bar complimentary water with turndown coffee amp tea check in smooth daily paper delivery  Concierge was very helpful  Highly recommend  Would stay there again without question  
N => Great hotel in great location We went to Montreal from     and was not disappointed in our choice of hotel  We paid the extra  for the Gold Level which included a spectacular view of downtown breakfast service from  am and cocktails appetizers from  pm  There was also full access to beverages from am   pm  The airport shuttle drops you off right at the front door and the hotel is located on top of the central train station  There is direct access to the underground amp metro stations  We had hockey tickets and the Bell Centre was only  blocks away  St  Catherine Street where most of the shopping was located was a  minute walk Old Montreal was a   minute walk Chinatown was a  minute walk the Biodome amp Olympic Stadium was a     minute walk in through the underground and a  minute direct ride by metro The only time we had took a taxi was when we went to Au Pied de Cochon for dinner  On a side note I highly recommend you do not miss having dinner at this place It is highly well known by the locals and well praised by food critics and it does not disappoint  It was unpretentous and had a warm neighborhood feeling  If youre not into foie gras there are other items on the menu  I had the beet amp goat cheese salad venison ribs and sugar pie  All were excellent  It was soooo good I would go back to Montreal just to eat at this restaurant  its closed on Mondays Back to the hotel the staff was very hospitable extremely helpful with directions restaurant recommendations and was just very genuine in nature  Not once did we encounter any bad service or attitude from this hotel  An example of the hotel staff going above and beyond   we got directions to the Biodome on Monday  But when we arrived everything was closed  When we returned to the hotel and mentioned that everything was closed they apologized for not telling us  We werent even complaining about it  When we went to dinner at one of the nearby local restaurants they had called the restaurant and bought us a couple glasses of wine  Then when we returned to our room they had tea and a tray of truffles waiting for us as an apology for the oversight  You dont get that kind of service anymoreOur only complaints about the hotel   european sized bathrooms and not enough drawer space  Our only complaints about Montreal   the museums were a bit dull Chinatown consisted of  blocks during this time of the year a lot of the street vendors are not out and Old Montreal really does not feel anything like Paris  The only thing remotely close is the Metropolitan sign near the W hotel and the french speaking people The highlights of our trip   the local people this hotel staff and Au pied du Cochon makes us want to come back to Montreal   perhaps next time during the summer  
N => Excellent Location and Wonderful Staff We chose this hotel because of the proximity to Gare Centrale right above the station  We guessed that the Amtrak Adirondack would be late and it was as usual  It was wonderful to just get in an elevator and go up  flights to the hotel lobby and not have to have the hassle of finding a cab for another hotel location  The staff was extremely warm and friendly  The doorperson advised us as to the best restaurants in the area  His suggestions were right on  Being right above the train station put us close to the Metro stop at Bonaventure as well  Everything was right in the vicinity  The Metro took us  stops to Old Montreal  The room was excellent as well  Overall a very positive experience that I would gladly repeat in the future  
N => Six stars This was without doubt the finest hotel experience of my life  I stayed for two nights at a discounted rate was allowed to check in to my room at am after arriving off an overnight train and was given a room on the st floor overlooking the ie Reine du Monde Cathedral  The room was as big as a suite and as luxurious  The piano bar was a highlight and the restaurant was great  The staff were genuinely friendly professional and couldnt do enough to help  Definitely recommended  
N => Okay hotel   ent service tiny rooms This is a perfectlly acceptable  star business hotel  The rooms are very small   almost all of them are the same size too  That said the rooms are perfectly comfortable with a good bed lights that work a tiny but functional bathroom and the usual amenties  The high speed internet worked well which was a relief as I had lots of work to do  The service was good enough but nothing special  Turndown service is available only upon request and when I requested it nothing happened  Perfectly happy here but will look for something more memorable next time Im in town  I like boutique hotels but often shy away from them because they often don t have things I need   like a gym and reliable high speed internet access  Next time Ill try the Gault  
N => Nice but not worth the price The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth was a lovely hotel  The Lobby was out of this world  The hotel is an excellent location nearby to almost everything you need even the nightlife  However the rooms were disappointing they were clean but very small and certainly not worth the amount we paid  In fact we paid considerably less in Ottawa for a   hotel and it was far more luxurious than the Fairmont  Service was friendly but they allocated us a room that was already occupied  They did allocate us another room after we had disturbed the current occupant and then kindly charged us for the service a day or so after we checked out of the hotel  Again they did refund the charge after we complained  A nice hotel but Im sure there are others of the same standard that are more value for money and less hassle in Montreal  
N => Lots of problems  Ive never stayed at a Fairmont property before but have admired many from afar Empress Hotel in Victoria Chateau Lake Louise Banff Springs Palliser in Calgary Frontenac in Quebec City Hotel Vancouver  I was genuinely looking forward to my four night stay at the Queen Elizabeth and imagined luxurious accomodations and pleasant courteous staff How wrong I was When we arrived in the evening around pm by car no one was there to greet us help us unload our vehicle or even hold open the door as we struggled to bring our luggage in  The inside was very dated looked to be trapped in the late searly s the outside is a monolithic block definitely not the quothistoricalquot or unique look of other properties and definitely not up to the standards of their other properties  When we got to the room not only did it resemble the interior oration of a Super  motel we also discovered that they had given us two double beds and not the single queen that I had confirmed during my reservation  When I went downstairs to see what had happened the agent tried to blame the error on me and said that I quotprobably forgot to request itquot    not even an apology  But these were mere trivialities to what was to come Our first morning the electricity was out  Instead of being polite about it the staff felt compelled to blast this information at am over their loudspeakerintercom again no apologies  If you were asleep you wouldnt be after that Not to mention that you couldnt even get ready for the day since you couldnt see a thing    and we had to walk down sixteen flights of stairs to get outside  On our third day the cleaning staff went on strike  Not that we knew about it until we came back from a long day to find that our room was still not cleaned and wondered why  I called downstairs to see what was going on and was forced to sit on hold for over ten minutes  When I inquired why our room had not been cleaned the woman snapped quotI know it has not been cleanedquot and with further pressing said that the cleaning staff was on strike and there was nothing they could do except be quotsend some clean towels up quot When I suggested that be they could proactively give their guest a heads up she claimed that they did not know about it in advance  Funny I thought the crux of most strikes rest on the fact that they make it known that they will be going on strike unless certain conditions or demands are met The concierge continuously had long lines and their informationknowledge was very poor    when we asked for dining recommendations at pm they seemed baffled by thinking up such quotlate nightquot dining options  They were stumped by other fairly easy questions as well  We also did not receive our newspaper the first morning and the remainder of days we did not receive the newspaper we had requested  Normally I would overlook trivialities like that but everything else was such a terrible experience that this was a cherry on top I consider myself well travelled and have stayed at many kinds of hotels in many countries but this ranks in the Top  Worst Experiences  I will not be staying at this or any other Fairmont property in the future p s  The location of the Queen Elizabeth is not nearly as great as it seems  You have to wind through a number of bizarre tunnels and staircases to get to the train stationMetro that it sits on top of  The riott and Sheraton nearby are much more accessible  Also the valet service is very awkward  You have to take an elevator to the main floor transfer then either take the stairsescalator or another elevator to reach it  Very annoying if you have any suitcases or are carrying anything heavy  
N => Good experience We just returned from our first trip to Montreal and our experience at Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth was overall quite positive  The staff with the exception of one grumpy maid was unfailingly polite and helpful  Three days into our stay we requested a room change as we had some talkative night owl neighbors and an even nicer room was found for us immediately even though the hotel was sold out  For location this hotel cannot be beat  Directly beneath is the fabulous Underground City the central train station the Metro and links to just about anywhere you want to go in the city  We liked the hotel restaurants but also enjoyed the many less pricey dining opportunities in the Underground City  We would definitely stay at this hotel again  
N => Loved it We stayed at the Queen Elizabeth over New Year and we loved the hotel  The room was a little bit small but very well furnished and very comfortable  The location was excellent for our sightseeing trips in Montreal  Only critique I have is in order to go to the pool we had to take the elevator to the main floor swith elevators and then we came to the pool area  As a fellow guest said quot They planned this to maximize embarrassment of all guestquot  I would stay at the Fairmont again  
N => Gave away our room We were met by a supercilious French accented woman at the front desk on ember   who told us that the discounted rooms were all gone  Instead of paying the  of my  guaranteed reservation     we were going to have to pay   I asked to talk to a manager  The woman walked away and shortly returned saying we could have a reated room usually  for   I should say so Ive never heard of a hotel trying to raise the rate of a credit card guaranteed reservation  Not what I wanted to hear after a nine hour drive  They say that French speakers look down on English speakers in Montreal  I dont know if this is true but the woman at the desk made me think so  The room was charming with a arate alcove with a desk  Housekeeping was so fabulous  The spacious room gleamed  Triple sheeting on the beds  Extremely fluffy towels and robes  Elegant toiletries    generously refreshed  My husband was annoyed that they wanted  a day to use the highspeed Internet hookup in the room  I was disappointed that all the rooms for  in the hotel had double beds  Queen beds are so much more comfortable  Otherwise the room was very very nice We ate at the Montrealaise in the Queen Elizabeth  The food was pretty good but the service was escargot paced  The waiter I dont think he understood us very well    another French speaker almost never came back to our table  Never refilled my coffee cup  Didnt try to explain the salad bar or show us where to find plates  I would never go back there    especially with the amazing che only a block or two away in the underground shopping mall  
N => Incredible and a lot of Fun My husband and I just stayed at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth this past weekend ust  and thought it was fabulous We got a great rate by going directly to the Fairmont website and choosing quotFairmont Supersaverquot as an option   which meant that we had to pay in advancecould not cancel  This hotel has the BEST location   it is right in the heart of downtown Montreal in middle of all the action  Without leaving the hotel   the elevator can take you to the subway the VIA train station and is also connected via underground to every mall food options the ch  resturant etc  and more To tell you the truth we did not enjoy the hustle and bustle of downtown Montreal   so we retreated to our hotelroom often and enjoyed the facilities   nice heated pool scented steam room and huge exercise facilities bigger than my regular gym  Above all that it was so exciting acting like little kids trying to discover all the places we could get to underground without ever having to go outside  Since our room was a supersaver  CAD on a weekend it wasnt huge   but they made good use of the space and it was reated and orated nicely  We didnt have a great view   but who cares I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to Montreal and is looking for a nice place to stay in the heart of downtown the  star Travelodge which was much farther away was charging more  Good luck and ENJOY 
N => Treated like a Queen We spent  days at the Queen Elizabeth  What a wonderful hotel Our room on the th floor was spacious room service was quick hot and delicious  When our travel agent failed to warn us a reservation was needed for the Sunday brunch we thought we would be disappointed  Although they were quotbooked solidquot they found room for our party of four  The concierge Robert was very helpful and suggested a resturant quotGibbysquot that was one of the best I have ever eaten in  
N => Montreal Canada    OK quiet  Montreal was ok thanks to the Jazz Festival that was going on  We took a rafting trip and it was fun also We stayed at the Queen Elizabeth it was in my scale of   a   Was told to besure and go to Old Town but it was just a tourist trap more shops of the same stuff and that was just about it  besides resturant alleyThe trip was Ok and no really bad experiences  Pam Urania 
N => Disappointingly outdated hotel  Reasonable location  This hotel was a disappointment  After staying at two other fairly nice Fairmont hotels in Canada Vancouver and Edmonton I was quite disappointed with this one  The hotel is large and is conveniently located on top of the train station but it looks very outdated not Victorian outdated but s outdated  Not at all what we expected of a Fairmont  It was not bad bad but I wouldnt stay here again if I have a choice  
N => Great hotel worth the money Comparable in price to the Sheraton iott and Hilton but much better accommodations service and location  I tried them all and keep coming back to the Queen E  Newly reated and better than ever  Compared to hotel prices in NYC they are a bargain Dont get me wrong this is not a discount hotel but no more expensive than others in its caliber  
N => Avoid this hotel Although a somewhat regular patron of the Queen Elizabeth recently my experiences have dropped into the terrible category and I now avoid this hotel amp recommend the same to everyone  In my most recent stay the alarm system went off numerous times between midnight amp  am including announcements to stay in the rooms with no real emergency apparent  This is the nd or rd time that this has happened to me and I have been told that it has happened to other guests at other times  To me there is a fundamental problem with the system  In another incident a hotel employee walked in un announced to my room even with a do not disturb sign on the door Overall the experience is terrible and there are better choices in Montreal  
N => Big Not Terribly Special   
N => Adequate hotel   good location The hotel is on top of a mall which was convient and has a metro  subway station attached  We used the metro to go everywhere we walked to the old city once   take the metro even though its just one stop  The rooms were adequate with a mini fridge and a small TV  We booked a superior room but other than providing a good view of the city there was nothing superior about it  the staff were all friendly but the desk staff didnt have any maps and gave us incorrect directions  The buffet included is just a cold breakfast but you can upgrade to the hot one which was very good although it cost   extra per person  Over all it was ok but I think Id try something different next time  
N => Be careful when using the online reservation system Be very careful when booking this hotel through their online reservation system  When I arrived they claimed that I had booked for ember and not ember  I had the confirmation from the hotel and they still seemed to question it  I had to stand my ground for the reservation that I made online and was supported by all of the documentation ember date that their system sent me  My interaction with them seemed to indicate that it was my problem until I refused to back down  They then relented and told me that they were out of the type of room that I booked for non smoking two beds  I had to choose between a smoking room with two beds or a non smoking with one bed  I choose the smoking and I was pleased that you could not tell the difference  If you have a large vehicle avoid the parking garage  It is very small and the attendant was not very pleasant with helping us  We had to find parking elsewhere Apart from these issues the hotel was great  I really would have preferred not to have had the unnecessary reservation drama at check in  
N => Execellent hotel Hotel was a great place to stay very clean  Very friendly staff  Gave me great places to check out since I was new to montreal  Very helpful I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Worst hotel EVER Do not stay there This is the worst hotel we have EVER stayed at  I dont know who ided to give them three stars but they dont deserve even  a star  The electricity went out twice in our room the lady at the front desk pretended like she dont speak English they cant give you an extra pillow  Our room was directly above the ballroom and there were loud death music playing till AM on a Wednesday night and the hotel refused to switch us to another room  I guess there is no such thing as service to any English speaking tourists at the Gouverneur Hotel  Do yourself a favor and do not stay at this hotel I hope they go out of business soon Theyre so rude I think Ill avoid going to Montreal period in the future 
N => Expensive but not Horrible We stayed at Place Dupuis for  days for the Canada Day long weekend  The hotel was clean and so was the room  The price was quite high for what was offered but it was a long weekend and no other hotels nearby had any openings The staff is friendly enough but you do sometimes get the old English versus French issue but it only happened a couple of times  We had a Superior Room which costed  a day extra than the standard room but it came with breakfast which was your standard hotcold buffet  The view from our particular room was awful one side of the hotel faces a business complex  The parking was expensive but it was underground  Had a mini bar that we used to store food that had to be kept cold  The room was not very spacious but had wireless internet that was very reliable  For an expensive hotel the or was dated but doesnt matter all that much I guess  
N => Great experience overall The service was great  Everyone was very helpful  The room was also very nice  Food at the restaurant was good  I would definitely return to Place Dupuis if I ever go back to Montreal  
N => Luv the Guv Sorry about the stupid title Long story short   Stayed here several times have never had a problemalways had a pleasant experience with anyone involved in the operation of the hotel  There are some reviewers whom I think would blame a hotel for bad weather which I had for my entire stay or blame a hotel for situations that could happen anywhere but just happen to happen to you at this property at this particular time  Its called life   live it and enjoy it youre on vacation   go do something  If your entire reason to live is to nitpick every little insignificant thing then stay home and drive each other crazy Dont go to another country and keep reinforcing the stereotypical quotUgly Americanquot   but I digress  The parking garage was fine Im short and dont drive a tank so I had no problem  I only bumped my head once I had a great time its close to everything you dont have to go outdoors to access the Metro  Last but not least Roland my waiter at the breakfast buffet was terriffic  I had forgotten about him until I returned this year  He is cheerful attentive crisped my bacon at my request because the buffet bacon was underdone to my liking anything I asked for he quickly and cheerfully attended to  The Gouverneur should be proud to have such a dedicated employee Had a great rate  CDN including breakfast buffet rd night was  price Parking   per  hr period Will stay here again and again  
N => Very Disappointed   I was  of the party of  rooms with Drop the Stars Let me begin by saying that it was an unpleasant stay and I would NOT recommend anybody stay at these accommodations  As Drop the Stars mentions in their review some of the staff at the front desk not to mention some of the dinner wait staff are not very friendly or accommadating  They didnot honor the Triple A pricing for  of the  rooms  They did not want to help their guests with anything  As if they had a  point checklist stuffed in their front pockets  Anything not on that list they could not doThe hotel has very bad plumbing  In the  days we were there the toilet in my room backed up  times  Two other rooms toilets backed up as well  Need I go into any details as to why this could be an embarrasing situation The room next to mine had the sink clog twice and the room across the hall had a clogged bathtub  Cudos to the maintenance department Does management intend to address this plumbing problemThe hotels competition must own major shares in Canadian Roto Rooter stock Then there is the issue of the fire alarm sounding off at  a m  It was going for an hour When I called the front desk to ask if everything was all right their response was in a monotone voice only Dick Cavitt could imitate in one of his monologues  quotPlease stay in your room sir its a false alarm  We are having trouble resetting the alarm quot Meanwhile the wide eyed guests from the upper floors are frantically herding down the stair wells in what I would say was not an organized or calm fashion  After an hour or more of this the alarm quiets but you can still here it on the upper and lower floors  After another hour those alarms quiet down  Everthing is now quiet        so we think  Now a different alarm sounds off much louder then the first similiar to a W W I I Air Raid alarm  Am I supposed to trust the person at the front desk who happens to be on the ground floor that everthing is OK That alarm finally quiets down  Oh look at the clock its time to get up The day before we walked into the hotel lobby only to find out we could not go to our rooms  There were about  Canadian firemen blocking the elevators  They were checking for smoke with their meters  This ordeal went on for hours  It ended up someone released pepper spray Toiletries what can I say about toiletries Will I get my soap today What about mycomplimentary coffee packets Or will I have to ask one of the other rooms for theirs again One room requested toilet paper the night before they called  times and finally received it at  in the a m  There were  people in that room  They had to use toilets from some of their travel mates rooms The parking garage is a joke  If you stand taller than  quot I hope you have a good back because your walk to the elevators will be in a crouched position  The locals seem to use the garage too  You  be forced to use valet or another means for parking  The parkingattendants dont speak English or French When I went to the front desk to complain  they basically didnt want to hear it  They offered no comps or price breaks for the miserable stay  I could continue on about this frustrating experience but instead I say this  Dont stay at this hotel unless you look into it thoroughly  Good Luck 
N => A Dump Is an Understatement From the moment we checked in the rate we were qouted was not accurate  That same evening there was fire department activity no one was told what was going on just that we couldnt return to our rooms  The next morning  a m  we were woken from our beds by the sound of the fire alarm again and people running down the fire escapes  Once again we were not really clued in on what the problem was  During the course of the stay out of the six different rooms we had occupied five of the toilets backed up  Although they were quick to fix them it was still an ongoing problem  If this wasnt enough the problem of the homeless outside the hotel oh and the occasional straggler inside was horrible  The area the hotel is in is not a family friendly enviroment unless you dont mind watching someone climb in a garbage truck to get there belongings out  The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast buffet but thats only when they dont hand you the check and rush you out  
N => A Total Dump Stay away We got in for the GP Formula  prize weekend and we had bought a very expensive package from an agency  This place was in a horrible neighborhood full of kies and shady people  The lobby was already depressing but the rooms were unbelievably dingy stinky and super depressing  Our first room smelled of stale smoke we had asked for non smoking and had cobwebs coming from the lamp  Every time someone in the street let out a scream which was pretty oftenyou could hear it all the way in our room   both my husband and I were disgusted and asked for another room  They switched us to one facing the inside but it was still absolutely horrible and depressing  We checked out of there as fast as we could and went to the W a totally different universe   absolutely wonderful 
N => Pride weekend watch out    The staff was very courteous and friendly The location is perfect As efficient as it can be during a festival like that I had a cloged toilet that took h and  visits to the front desk to get it fixed They never called me to apologise or anything like that If you insist to stay there make sure that your window doesnt face the square where the festivities happen or you will never be abble to rest PLus they are accepting reservations from the thursday only not possible fri sat sun At teh time they called themselves a  star    I completely disagreegood luck 
N => Excellent Value   Excellent Business Cneter   Perfect Pool   Breakfast to die fo I had stayed at Hotel W          It was so overpriced for what was offered which was young handsome staff dressed in black that escape to the Hotel Gouverneur Place Dupuis seemed like bargain basement pricing in four star hotel rooms       I was half afraid that be they had cut out maintenance or something To cut to the quick  Everything at the Hotel Gouverneur Place Dupuis was good  The pool was large and inviting  The room was clean and comfortable  Instead of one large trendy chair there were three comfortable ones  Instead of a see through glass walled shower like at the Hotel W the wall was solid but the washroom had both tub and shower The big difference was in the breakfast          like it is simply perfect  Everything from fresh nuts to high quality yogurt and cheeses  Trying not to overeat I skipped the hot dishes Excellent value great location nice staff            
N => Not A Bad Place  
N => trip from hell  
N => A poor choice I booked this hotel many months ago for a first venture to Montreal as a vacation area  Reviews seemed good at the time but the hotel was in the process of changing management and brand   THAT SHOUD HAVE BEEN MY FIRST CLUE Websites did not have all the information needed and calls were necesary each time the person answering was not able to give information needed but said someone else would call back  No calls causing my recall  Third time was the charm and all semed well  Arrived on t  for a three day stay  This is the beginning of day  and all is not well  At check in the staff at the desk no one has a name tag said the room was not ready  We were meeting with friends who were already arrived  Once that was made known a room already made up was available two doors away from theirs  Room seem fine although old style and colors  Six hour later housekping showed up to make up the room   they seem to have no idea what has or has not been done  Bed was fine view was great Bathroom was small in need of repair and the ground fault interrupter for the hair dryer had to be reset evey  seconds of use I am sorry to say we have two more days of this to look forward to  
N => Hot Hot Hot and not the good kind of hot I checked in on Friday afternoon ust   My room on the rd floor was nice  As I requested except for the fact that it was  degrees in it  After a shower I called the front desk and they moved me to a smaller room on the rd floor which was still acceptable  After hanging out there for a bit and hoping that it was a matter of time before it cooled down I check the thermostat and it was  degrees  I was sweating  It was a hot weekend in Montreal  Called the front desk again and told them that the AC was simply not working but the front desk would actually not admit that it wasnt working  Eventually I got moved to a quotSUITEquot  This was their way of hoping to make good for the inconveniences  The suite is actually like an apartment with a kitchenette dining area sofa foyer etc    not what I needed or wanted but hey it came with an assurance of being cool  The problem with this room no WI FI but they did give me a cable to connect directly to the LAN which I never did get to work  They gave me a coupon for a free breakfast which was nice of them  I turned the thermostats down to their lowest level and it lacking a digital readout Im going to guess that the temperature in the room was   The fact that it was on the rd floor and not east facing is what made it cooler  I have to say Laura was very pleasant to deal with  I searched high and low for a ent hotel close to the village for a good rate    I got a good rate    but it wasnt worth the heat The bed in the room was a metal frame which was once screwed into the wall  The screws have since been completely come out of the wall and the dry wall dust is sitting on dark blue carpet glaring right up at you when you go to make the bed  Why oh why doesnt housekeeping clean it up Do not know  be for the same reason that the tray with  empty glasses was sitting beside the rd floor elevator for  hours  All in all not a good experience at the Grand Plaza sadly  I was hoping that it was going to become my new favourite hotel while in Montreal  Guess Im going to have to keep looking  
N => Across the street from the Metro  My teenage son amp I stayed here when we went to Montreal to see Radiohead  The valet parking drop off area is pretty small be room for  cars but the harried valet was very pleasant amp we didnt have to wait long for him to bring us our car back when we checked out  Its seen better days but the room we got was very comfortable amp e had an uneventful stay  St  Denis St with its cafes is only block or  away but be warned its probably one of the most quotfrenchquot areas when we sat at one patio the server had to get someone from the kitchen to speak english with us that was a first for me in probably  visits over the years to Montreal  When I told some local friends where we were staying one commented quotYou must be bravequot she was referring to the neighbourhood but my son amp I walked all around amp never felt any reason to be nervous  Although I had no problems with the hotel its location for access to the places I like to be when Im in Montreal isnt the best  Ill try to be more central to where I want to be next time  Booked this on Hotwire so didnt know exact location or hotel until Id paid  
N =>  Star More like   Star When my husband and I arrived to the Montreal the hotel was hard to find because of several street closures  Needless to say that was not under their control  Once we finally reached the hotel it was  hours past check in time at  PM check in time was  PM  We were so exhausted from our  hour road trip and were anxious to get to our hotel room only to find out from the unapologetic and rude receptionist that they needed another  minutes to get it ready for us Mind you we had made the reservation over a week in advance and were charged for the hotel right away  We then had no choice but to wait in the reception area and finally  minutes later I ided to ask them if the room was ready and luckily it was  But of course they didnt even have the ency to tell us when we were waiting in their lobby in plain sight Any how we go to the room to find a tiny room with a broken vent and wall paper peeling off the walls and a tiny bathroom   btw when booking the room we were told that the room will have a King bed however it actually had a queen bed  Any how I go to use the shower to freshen up only to find hair in the shower and a black floor  It was obvious the bathroom was not cleaned  I called house keeping no answer to no surprise  I had to go downstairs to the reception area again to tell them and finally  minutes later the room bathroom was cleaned  My husband and I then leave to go out We return to the hotel room  hours later only to find that ALL OF THE ELEVATORS IN THE HOTEL ARE NOT WORKING We were told by the receptionists to either take the stairs mind you we were staying on the th floor or the service elevator  Well my husband and I take the offer to use the service elevator however we didnt know what was waiting for us in the elevator In the service elevator was garbage flies and a used plunger They didnt even have the ency to clean it for their guests We finally make it to our hotel room and my husband tries to turn on the TV but the remote doesnt work We then try to call the front desk from the phone next to our bed and that doesnt work either My husband then finally uses the other phone in the room to call the front desk only to hear from them that they will come up when they can  Everyone is trying to get the elevators working Someone finally comes up about  minutes later with a new remote  Also another fair warning it was really hot and humid in Montreal over the weekend we stayed  WE go to turn on the air conditioner and it doesnt seem to work  We go to the front desk only to find out that the hotel has a centralized AC unit and we cannot adjust it  We were stuck in a hot muggy hotel all weekend  The stay at this hotel nearly ruined our weekend  They only good thing about the hotel was that it was really close to the Metro so we could leave and get around easily  We even tried to leave the night we got there but everything in the city was booked so we were stuck  To everyone considering this self proclaimed quot starquot hotel   save your money  Its a piece of crap 
N => Aging Doubletree But Not Too Bad Spent  nights at this property then a Doubletree  Good location large rooms excellent views of Montreal  Rooms could use a makeover  not awful but not up to todays standards  Parking garage was something of a pain and a bit pricey  Had breakfast buffet one morning in hotel  expensive but pretty good  At the right price I would recommend this hotel  
N => Do NOT Stay Here Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this place  Other than the comfortable beds there are few nice things about this place  The check in was horrible  Our rooms werent ready on time  I have young kids and requested adjoining rooms when I made the reservations  When they gave us our rooms they said the hotel was full and there were no adjoining rooms available  They said be the next day when it wasnt as busy adjoining rooms would become available  The next day different staff we were told there ADJOINING ROOM dont exist in this hotel I then asked him why when I made my reservation they didnt tell me that He sent for the manager  The manager did some major double talking that to this day I still dont know whether that hotel has adjoining rooms  Just left a sour taste in my mouth  The rooms themselves were small  The or was dated  The bathroom was atrocious for a quothigherquot end hotel  It was small and old   in major need of a face lift  The parking was terrible  The Valet parking was SOOO slow  The hotel has only a very small driveway and cars are squeezed into it  Every time you were in the lobby you would consistently overhear people complaining about the valet parking  The self parking was no better  It doesnt allow you inout access  Overall bad service and bad accomodations  Again do yourselves a favor and stay elsewhere  
N => Good value good hotel I stayed here for one night  We arrived at about  and they were unable to give us early check in but they were swamped due to the Honduran soccer team staying thereand hundreds of Honduran fans The room was clean view fantastic beds comfortable with duvets instead of awful bed spreads  Everything was as good as can be expected particularly for   Good location at the top of St  Denis easy walk to St  Laurent right above a Metro station There isquite a bit of street parking on the side streets   just avoid the areas reserved for local residents  This saved us  in parking  
N => expecting more Hotel was ok  I was expecting so much more  I booked an Executive room and was expecting what the Double tree hotels usually give to Executive rooms  But it seems that this hotel doesnt give those quotspecial servicesquot   Our hotel book said that our room was suppose to have robes it did  It was suppose to have a wet bar it didnt  It was suppose to have an in room safe it didnt  it was suppose to have a private lounge for executive level floors it didnt  Evening reception no  The morning breakfast we had to call down to the front desk and ask was that included like it had said  It was but only for the  adults children would be extra  The room was large  The beds comfortable  The house keeping staff was wonderful  Room service was prompt and good  Pool was older but kids liked it  Parking was a bit of a mess but thanks to the excellent valets they took care of any problems  Front desk staff were helpful and pleasant  
N => Interesting stay I stayed at the Doubletree for two nights  The location was much better and more convienent than I had thought it would be when I booked it  It was just around the corner from the Metro stop that can take you to the eating and shopping areas in Montreal The bathroom needed updating but was adequate for our needs  We had a north facing room and we didnt hear a single other guest while we were in the rooms  We had two confusing occurences happen to us  The first was when our keycards became demagnetized after being in a pocket of my purse all day  According to the girl at the desk this happens when the cards come into close proximity to credit cards or a magnet  She quickly reactivated them and we were able to enter our room  The second came when our bill reflected a charge for phone calls that were made before we had checked into our room  This was also corrected quickly at check out  Overall a nice stay and I would stay there again if only for the close proximity to public transportation and the view  
N => Very accommodating We booked  rooms for  nights this past weekend for a stay at the Doubletree Montreal  We were not disappointed  I picked this hotel mostly because of the price I found a good deal online for the holiday weekend  The rate was comparable to many lesser rated hotels on this site  I was slightly apprehensive because of some of the other reviews but all  of us enjoyed our stay  We found the staff to be very accommodating to our needs  We all enjoyed the warm chocolate chip cookies at check in  We switched  of the rooms after the first night one because we ided we wanted a better view another because we wanted  arate beds  The rooms that were alleged to have a single queen bed appeared to actually have a double if you want a larger bed I would request a room with a king size  The front desk was helpful with changing the rooms and we found the second set of rooms to our satisfaction  Overall all the rooms were clean the beds were comfortable bathrooms were free of mold views of the city were nice  As noted in other reviews the bathrooms are small towel rack is in the shower itself  The first night I found the neighboring room was noisy TV was very loud people yelling second night was very quiet  We found the location was good  block to Saint Denis latin quarter area about  blocks to Prince Arthur Street area metro stop is right next door if you dont feel like walking back after further jaunts to Vieux Montreal etc  Our reservation did not include breakfast although the first morning we did eat at the hotel for the buffet  We found the food was good although for about person we certainly could have found food elsewhere for less money and comparable quality  Next time I would try to arrange breakfast to be included in the reservation  The parking was convenient attached to the hotel but also was a bit steep at day  But it is nice to know your car is indoors  Also note if you ide not to use the valet service you will need cash  deposit initially for parking  Overall I would say this is a good quality  star hotel anyone looking for luxury accommodations should look elsewhere  It covers the basics and a little more very well and I would certainly consider it during my next visit to Montreal  
N => Definitely Not a  star I didnt notice the hotel was under reation  The spacious room I got was quite old and bathroom is not that clean Beds are very comfortable Metro sherbrooke is min away by walk and you can reach downtown in less than  min Average price paid was   for one night  
N => Will stay here again  We just got back from a trip where we stayed at this hotel for one night  We found the hotel to nice and clean  The only complaint I would have with room is some drywall above the texture wallpaper was not finished nicely  Otherwise the room was a good size and nicely furnished  My wife was bothered by people partying in the hallway and adjacent rooms during the night For the price we paid we found this to be a very good deal  They gave us cookies when we checked in After I booked this on Hotwire and read some of the previous reviews of this hotel I was worried  When we enter the room I was pleasantly suprised I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and we would stay at the hotel again  
N => Avoid this hotel This hotel was rated a  star on hotwire   way too many stars  Rude front desk staff vomit on the bedskirt old nylons under the bed a bathroom that I cant even describe    I am not a diva and I do not write this review lightly  The location is okay the room size is all right and giving credit where it is due the beds are quite comfyI checked nightly to make sure they were clean  Our sheets never got changed over  nights  One day we didnt get any facecloths or towels  Our glasses were rinsed under the bathroom tap and replaced   of us in the room and they would not leave us three coffee cups only two  Room service was unbelievably horrid    ever had a daquiri rimmed with salt Or a cosmo served in a cocktail class with a plastic spider in itIm assuming for halloween but by that point let me say I certainly didnt see the humor  I have stayed in a lot of places    this is the ugly stepsister of hilton   please find somewhere else to stay to avoid disappointment  
N => Bad Vibes So So Location Good Size Room I spent one night at the Doubletree Plaza formerly Intercontinental property known as the Crowne Plaza because I needed to be near the Latin Quarter  I also stayed at the Sheraton Le Centre close to McGill University and I stayed at the Hotel Gault in old Montreal The hotel is located near the Latin Quarter and is across the street of a Metro station  Some guests told me they choose this property because of proxmity to Metro station and they prefer to stay at Hilton properties During my stay in Montreal the weather was exceptional warm and dry  McGill is very attractive university on a small mountain Check was okay but felt odd vibe from the check in staff  Rest of staff appeared to be efficient  My room was good size room clean but recently was painted  The bed was comfortable and their was good size desk and television offered plenty of local and cable stations  The bathroom was a bit old looking but it was clean  The weather was moderate during my stay but I could see that the properties Heating amp A C  system could be an issue no variable controls in the room I ate at terrible restaurant in the nearby Latin quarter that tried to add greater price to my bill   Napoli Pizzeria stay away from there The food was average Also stay away from stores that have higher prices than the entertainment district business district and old Montreal I paid around   via the hotel website  I really did not like the area so I would not consider returning to this property plus I did not feel a good vibe staying here so I would not return  During my stay in Montreal I ate at the Hard Rock cafe great service and the Le Brassire chain which was okay  I even walked to Old Montreal which was not too long of walk  The location is probably the best thing about this property In old Montreal I recommend Sport Du Vieux casual dining Restaurant Du Vieux Port steakhouse with exceptional and friendly service and Restaurant Des Gouverrid Freinch cuisine I would not return to this property because there are many better neighborhoods in Montreal to stay at  
N => A place to avoid Shabby hotel that used to be the Crowne Plaza   they did the right thing in leaving  Poor reception where we were allocated a room one bed smoking that clearly didn t meet our needs two beds non smoking   without being told  Revisiting reception they don t answer when you ring we were told a variety of excuses and creative solutions no more rooms twin room does not mean more than one bed it is a very large bed we were finally allocated a room that could accommodate a party of   Valet parking also a mess   you have to check in first before they park the car   needless to say it s chaos outside the hotel Location not ideal   someway from the tourist area of Old Montreal   metro close by across the road but still two stops and a fair walk at the end Whilst a reasonable sized room there was a condensation problem between the panes such that what should have been a good view was almost opaque with the sunlight on it  Facilities a little lacking with no safe and mysterious room cleaning times   pm on the first day and am on the day we were checking out  Pool was a catastrophe  No changing rooms   just a toilet and shower  Poolside towels had run out and the pool itself was very cold CF despite claiming CF  It was also under filled so not clear whether it was filtering properly and therefore safe  No staff visible Bar appeared closed at pm Sunday night  This was shame as it would have been nice to have a drink whilst waiting for the elevators to be repaired  I m sure that walking up  floors did us more good Overall very disappointing and the worst hotel on our holiday  
N => Not thrilled We stayed here ust    Love Montreal and will definitely be back soon   but will not be staying at this hotel  The staff was friendly enough but the entire hotel smelled like paint and the painters did not do the best job  The pool was freezing and cloudy By far the worst experience was with the shower  It took  minutes for the hot water to come out of the shower and sometimes it didnt work at all  One morning I had to go downstairs and shower in the fitness center showers which werent all that clean The hotel is in a good location and the restaurantbar located a block away Domini is a great place to eat   but other than that I was less than pleased with my stay  
N => It was okay  We stayed at the Doubletree in Montreal and had called previously and booked a room for two nights  We called for directions as we were coming from the US and got terrible directions which caused us to get lost  When we arrived everything seemed fine  The room was lovely  However the thermostat did not work and it was freezing in the room  We had requested a non smoking room  We were told there were no other rooms and then they moved us to a smoking room which if you are a non smoker it is not very pleasant  Our stay in Montreal though was wonderful and we enjoyed the city immensely and will come back again  We will however be staying somewhere else  
N => Poor Service Me and my wife and  year old boy stayed here for  nights in ust   We were in Montreal to watch the NASCAR race It was a really hot week  Celcious  The air conditioning was terrible   in our room  The service in the restaurant was horrible  We sat at our table for  minutes before we finally retreated back to our room hungry  Ordered KFC and it arrived in  minutes  Next night the room service was also terrible hour  minutes for wings and nachos  Could not fit my truck in the hotel parking its for vehicles less than  feet  Had to pay  A day for valet parking and one night my truck literally blocked the sidewalk  With some scratches On the morning we were leaving I had to wait  hours to get my truck from the quotvaletquot parking  Seems someone lost the keys to the vehicle in front of me which were all parked in an alley  Will never stay there again  At  a night I expected much more  
N => Not a  star but rather a  star being generous The Doubletree by Hilton is by far the worse star hotel I ve ever stayed in from the customer service to the appearance of the room  This is not a hotel the Hilton should put their signature to  We haveexperience a few incidents from this hotel and the matter should be dealt with as I am quite disturbed by the lack of professionalism from this hotel Let me start with the Valet Parking for a star hotel there are no valet or bellboy and the door  We had to park our own vehicle and paythe valet cost the one time we ask for Valet service the attendant left the alley our truck was parked in an alley where all oversized vehicle are parked SQEALING the tires and drove rapidly onto the main busy street  He then back up into a parking sign where I repeatedly asked him to stop the truck  He did not listen and hit thesign and put a small dent in the truck  He finally stepped out of thevehicle and we pointed to him that he dented the truck he walked away saying  it happens   We were in a hurry spoke briefly to the manager stating the incident and told him we would come by later in the evening to discuss the incident Later that night we spoke to the Director of Operation Mr  Mounir Greiss and he mentioned to us this was not the first incident with this employee and that the matter will be resolved on Monday once the employee came back to work  He then asked us if we were currentlyreceiving complementary breakfast with our room and we told him we weren t  He then gave us a free breakfast and gave us an apology  I mquite astonished that we were not compensated any more for the damaged incurred to the truck as well as the Valet parking cost  We paid for a service we did not receive since we drove it in and out ourselves  On another note the also left the truck unlocked during the night when they moved the truck it was mentioned and showed to the valet how to arm and disarm  We have very expensive equipment in the truck and relieved none were stolen Now for the customer service the biggest issue was ordering room service  When the room attendant came up and Bill opened the door he pushed the door open and walked passed Bill and asked where he would like the tray put down  It was quite embarrassing since I was in the room and lacked in the clothing area actually I had no clothes on and hid under the covers  Does the hotel have a policy for the attendant to ask the client to enter the roomNow other issues or concerns I would like to point out  Maid cleaned the room but did not replenish items such as towels  We had nothing left by our last morning and had to scramble to find a main on our floor and get towels   Called  times to get room service and no one answered  Even the  Careline  had to response   We were in a non smoking room and floor and the room smelled like smoke and a wet dog    The sheer curtains were brown of cigarette smoke and had cigarette burns   I understand that the hotel wants to be pet friendly however the hotel should have a floor designated for pets only  This is concern for people who have severe allergies and asthma  For hygiene purposes some pets have fleas and if you allow the dogs to sleep in every room it will be harder to maintain and actually I m quite grossed out at the thought of sleeping in a bed or walking on the floor thinking a dog  have done his business there  
N => Horrible stay I would not recommend anyone to stay at doubletree  I read the positive comments and it was reasonable priced so I booked the hotel for a weekend getaway with my husband  When we arrived the room was not ready  and we were over an hour late to check in and the room was still not ready  The staff were not helpful we sat at the lounge area for another hour until our was ready  The towels in the bathroom looked dirty and had hair on it the showerhead had no pressure  The location was not great it a long walk to saint catherine and it is near the village not anywhere near the shopping district  All an all an average hotel with horribe service  
N => A big diappointment We just came back after staying at this hotel for  nights and I was so diappointed  Not only the location isnt good the service was lacking  For those who want to do a lot of the usual tourist sight seeing activities this is not a good location and a transit strike doesnt help no matter how close the station is to the hotel The only thing that it is close to is the Latin quarter and some nice shopping and restaurantscafes onaround St  Denis  Other  star hotels like Hyatt and Delta Montreal have much better location that is closer to old montreal St  Catherine and underground shopping and also have nicer amanities in a nicer neighborhood  Three days before arrival we made request for a non smoking corner room with a king size bed on a higher floor  When we arrived we got a room quotnext toquot a corner room and two double beds on th floor  They only met one of our requests of non smoking room  The front desk said she would change room for us as soon as a room with a queen or king size bed became available and we heard nothing from the front desk for the entire stay and we didnt bother because were fearing we would get a worse room   The room looked old and if it was reated it was done many years ago  The or looked very early s  Immediately upon arrival we had a problem with the plumbing  The toilet didnt flush  We called front desk and was told they would send someone to get it fixed quotright awayquot or they would switch us to another room if it cant be fixed  We waited for a good  minutes and no one showed up  Hubby was starving and didnt want to wait and we took off  By the time we came back it was fixed but it still looked very scary and more of the same plumbing problem occurred the next couple days  If more than  oz of water was dumped into the toilet it wont flush or it took   minutes to go down  It was really frustrating having to deal with this plumbing problem during our entire stay  Therere times we had to go down to the mezzanine floor to use the restrooms because the maintenace personnel was taking too long to get to us probably busy fixing plumbing problems in other rooms or delivering towels to other rooms   The next day we came back from our outing we found our bed made up and the housekeeper left a note thanking us for the tips but when I walk into the bathroom there was not a single towel in sight  The toilet paper was untouched no triangle or anything to indicate anything had been done and theres only  of roll left and no extra roll was left  We called housekeeping but theres no answer and eventually it was routed to front desk and the poor maintenance guy who fixed our toilet the day before showed up with towels and toilet paper  The third day were left with no tissue paper and I just made do without it since I was so tired of calling to get problems corrected  I was thinking to myself the previous review wasnt kidding and it probably happened more frequently than it was mentioned  In all my travel I hadnt yet encountered this even in a motel  The hotel cant be rated  stars  Both the hardware and service is just way below standard   After the first night there I found a faint small coffee stain on the sheet at the bottom corner so I placed the card requesting the sheet be changed  The same coffee stain was there when I returned  The same housekeeper that took our tips without leaving any towels just made up the bed and did not bother to change the sheet  The next day I placed the card right next to the coffee stain and the sheet was finally changed  If theres any stain how do I know a bed sheet was changed Was it ever changed from the prevous stay The thought grossed me out   Parking is   per day after taxes and the rate is the same whether its self parking or valet parking  They seemed to be short staffed and always encouraged guests to get the car themselves  Each time you get your car you have to go to the front desk to get your ticket validated if you want to get your car yourself  This is not convenient since theres usually not more than  people at the desk and you could wait a while before getting the ticket validated  The previous review said the garage has a low ceiling and boy its really low  The parking spaces were a bit tight but not as bad as some of the other hotels in Montreal  We didnt find any k on the SS levels or any dog but the garage looks like it could collapse anytime and theres no sign to indicate which way to exit  This whole parking situation is inconvenient and confusing   Upon checking out a mysterious charge of  showed up on our bill and the description was in French which I had no idea what it was  BTW all the other Montreal hotels I had stayed in all took note that were English speaking and presented everything in English or in both languages  When I inquired about this charge the front desk personnel quickly told me it was a mistake and presented me with a new bills with correct charge  As far as the front desk personnel goes I think theyre efficient enough but the service suffered becuase they were short handed  Overall I would avoid this hotel at all cost  Its not cheaper than any other  star hotels in Montreal but you get a lot less for your money  I could understand a little plumbing problem because of the age of the building but when its a service issue theres no excuse  There are a lot more hotels in Montreal that are in better locations and provides much nicer services for the same amount of money  No amount of warm cookies could make up for the bad services and the bad locations 
N => WOW Never been to Canada and came to visit schools for my son  I was so happy we stayed at this hotel  Some of my collegues mentioned this hotel was reasonable in rates compared to a lot of hotels in Montreal and they were right  My room was awesome and the bed I could have took it home with me  The staff was really nice and the hotel was full of people so I guess the word was getting around  When my son comes up to Montreal I will always stay in this hotelVery happy Alabama 
N => Great Doubletree Booked this hotel because it fit my perdium and I have to admit I am rather picky There were at least  restaurant kitty corner to the hotel and I was so happy to eat well during my  days in Montreal  The rooms were great and I was really looking forward to a great night sleep  The only complaint I could say is the pool was cold when I tried on my last day and the hotel was really packed which made it a bit long for the elevators I would recommed this hotel to anyone who wants to do more than just staying in the hotel even if the hotel rooms were great there is so much to do around James 
N => Dont stay there  
N => Lovely room but missing in some details    This was the second time we have visited Montreal for a two night mini holiday as we love Montreal  After a lot of research online love Trip Advisor we chose the Hilton Garden Inn  Being the Hilton name and not a cheap room we expected a lot First the room itself was lovely modern and very very clean  The staff were helpful with one exception and friendly  Location was also good as we love to explore the city on foot and using the Metro and got every where we wanted that way including walking to the Old City But being a Hilton and the cost we expect a polished experience  First until I read a review submitted recently after we got back I had no idea that you had a room choice of bath or shower note the or not an and  This needs to be far clearer online and elsewhere We had a shower and although it was okay you had a choice either good water pressure OR warmer water as the warmer you turned the tap the less pressure you received   Secondly we are not much into nightlife and after along day of walking around we like to enjoy our evening in our comfortable suite which we pay the extra to have for just that reason and be watch a movie  Unfortunately the website is once again misleading and the channel selection is not what was expected and we were very disappointed  This is also where the helpfulness did not shine as a call to reception about this in case we just needed to do something different to get access the day we arrived led to a promise that we would hear from the general manager as this was not what the website said was available  Well we are now back home and still no call  And finally this one is just an example of how someone needs to pay attention to the details  The little pamphlet that you get your room access cards in clearly states that if you opt out of the daily paper you can drop your room fee accordingly by  cents who cares BUT yet the paper is not actually delivered to your door like a lot of hotels do  I dont get this one at all as we cant be alone in experiencing at the door delivery at other hotels  Come on Hilton We didnt bring a car so have no comment on parking at the hotel etc All in all we would recommend the hotel if the details dont concern you but as this is the second Hilton hotel family stay in Montreal that was lacking in the details we will take a long look before we book at either of the Hiltons we have visited in Montreal in the future  
N => ent but not up to usual HGI Standards We are generally loyal Hilton Garden Inn customers but this one just didnt make it for us  The room was too warm and there really was no way to adjust the AC to make things cooler  Beware no bathtubs  Just shower stalls so they told me  The lady of the house was not amused  And the plastic floor covering of the stall already had bubbled  The placement of the rail in the stall was not ideal either  The internet service was as slow as molasses in uary circa  both in the business center and even more pronounced in the room  I was not amused  This could have been an anomaly but Im glad I wasnt there on business  Were diamond club members so we received the complimentary breakfast buffet     but that was a disappointment too a surprise for Canada  We actually paid to eat somewhere else on the second day of our stay  The parking garage is fine as long as you take it slow  The location is good for walking to Vieux Montreal  Weve seen worse for sure we also expect a little more from this chain  
N => Great views and service The service was great  The security was top notch you even need to insert your card to get the elevator to work  The location was great  The rooms were clean and spacious  And of course the pooljacuzzipatio area on the th floor was incredible I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Quiet rooms fresh breakfasts and good advice I recently visited Montreal with my family  We wanted to stay downtown but close to the old city and of course in a well priced hotel  Besides the convenient location of this elegant clean hotel the customer service was impeccable and the food fresh and delicious  To our surprise but a pleasant one they do not have the typical breakfast buffet   they only have a few items and the rest eggs omelettes etc  was prepared fresh and to our liking   but at buffet prices The room was also extremely clean and tidy and everything in working order including a microwave oven which was ideal to warm up milk for our infant The staff were extremely friendly AND knowledgeable  They helped us with everything from restaurant recommendationsreservations to sightseeing tips guided tours and shopping  They also sent us to pretty much the best coffee houses I have enjoyed outside of Europe  Finally at the end of the day we enjoyed a very quiet and relaxing room   we could barely believe we were downtown  Definitely staying here again See you soon Montreal Oh almost forgot   they have a salt water pool    
N => A Major Disappointment One of the attractions of staying at a Hilton is expecting a standard level of customer service and satisfaction  This hotel was beautiful new and well kept but the quotservicequot provided by the staff and the management of this hotel fell well below Hilton standards Its pretty basic to arrange wake up calls but in this hotel we only got one of the three arranged not appreciated on the day of an early morning flight  We reported minor maintenance issues in our rooms and they were not resolved until having to report them multiple times hours later  Basically everything we spoke to the front desk and duty manager about went unresolved Be very careful with your bill when you check out of this hotel  Do not charge anything from the barrestaurant to your room or they will automatically add a   gratutity to your bill although this practice is not posted anywhere and it comes as a surprise to the customer  They will also not be able to provide you with a breakdowndetails of your restaurantbar charges  According to the room key sleeve they will deliver a newspaper to your room every morning and if you refuse they will credit your account the cost of the newspaper  Make sure you refuse this and get the credit because even if youre a Hilton Honors member they wont deliver any paper to your room  They dont deliver the paper to anyone There are many good hotels in downtown Montreal  Too bad this one is such a major disappointment  
N => A great new addition on Sherbrooke St Montreal I recently visited Montreal on a combination business  leisure trip I normally stay at a long time favorite hotel on Sherbrooke St but it tired looking so I ided to try the Hilton Garden Inn nearby Upon entering the hotel I was overwhelmed by the elegantly orated atrium lobby with the beautifull ceiling fixture  Check in was efficient and I was in my room in  minutes  My room was spacious and tastefully oratedthe bathroom had all the aminities and large fluffy towels  My kids enjoyed the exercise room and the saltwater pool  At most hotels in downtown Montreal you have to use valet parkingat inflated rates and gratuities  At this Hilton Garden inn I was able to park my large SUV without difficulty and at a reasonable cost  The staff was friendly polite and helpfull  I will stay at this hotel on my next trip to Montreal and would recommend this Hilton GardenInn to others Ralph L L 
N => Good location but not good value for money We stayed here for two nights from  to     We made our reservation directly with the hotel on its website  For the price we paid CAD night plus day for parking  we expected breakfast to be included but was told when we got there breakfast was an extra CADperson  Check in was fast and without any hassle  Parking was at the underground parking lot accessible by elevators  Security was very good as you need to use your room card key to use the elevators and to enter the parking lot  We were assigned a room on the nd floor with terrible view  The room was ordinary  queen size beds TV fridge microwave coffee maker small bathroom  The bathtub was dirty though there was dirt around the tub  We had our breakfast at the Cafe Circo at the lobby on the second day  It was a buffet with your choice of eggspancakesbaconsausage cooked to your liking  Cost for two adults was CAD   Our  year old ate for free  We were not too impressed with the breakfast so ided to go a nearby Chez Cora the next day  The swimming pool hot tub and fitness center are on the th floor also accessible with the room card key  Location is excellent as it is just two blocks away from the main shopping district  Overall it was an okay stay but we would not stay there again because it is not good value for money  Wew ould try the Holiday Inn next door the next time we are in Montreal  
N => Good location We stayed one night at the Hilton in ruary as were going by train and then using the Metro system  As it was ruary cold we found that the Hilton allowed you to travel to around Montreal without going outside  Staff were friendly and helpful and this  be the most secure hotel on Earth you can only enter and exit by elevator no street access  The downside was that our room was next to the heated pool and was very hot all the time  
N => The best service in a Montreal hotel hands down  I was there during a recent business trip to Montreal  I have to say that my selection of hotel could not have been better  From the time we were efficiently checked in until final check out the hospitality of the staff was amazing  I spent the odd hour or so out people watching on the patio while having a drink or two and I would be remiss in not mentioning the outstanding service of Max the waiter  He was extremely service oriented and friendly and was a great help with any questions I had regarding the surrounding area nightlife and metro transit  Anytime I return to Montreal I am guaranteed to stay at this establishment  I will also recommend them to whomever asks  
N => Great hotel staff not too swift The Good The rooms were great This hotel is only a year old and everything is up to date  The rooms are clean beds are comfy lots of space  The Hotel is very clean and well maintained  The badParking This is by far the worst parking garage EVER Its very tight and only  lane with  floors of parking  We had a difficult time finding a spot and then when we did we couldnt find how to get into the hotel  There is no signs telling you where to go then when we found how to get up it was stairs  This is fine when you dont have luggage to carry up the only other option would be to go up the parking ramps which are steep and you have a chance of getting hit by a car  This was not thought out at all when designing this hotel  I found the Staff at the front desk had no idea what was going on and rude  They charged items to our room that we didnt get our key card would stop working after one use and the staff wouldnt believe you when you went back down to get it re programmed  Im fluent in French but I speak English as my main language and the staff not thinking you can speak French would speak about you and other guests in French right in front of you  All in all the hotel was awesome but parking and staff horrible 
N => Nice hotel    bad experience I reached Hilton Diamond VIP status last year and have stayed in many HGI properties across North America  This is one of the nicest Ive been to   unfortunately we had a very bad experience there   We were traveling with our baby and just checked out of a different hotel because they had starting painting outside our door  When I called to make the reservation I was assured that there would be no painting reation work or construction happening during our stay  We booked a br suite that was spacious and clean  The service was also terrific up to this point  However the next day they started painting the hotel stairwell with extremely smelly and toxic paint  It was impossible to stay in our room for even a few minutes as the smell was burning our nostrils  The air conditioning system was also shut down for most of the day for service  We had to leave immediately  The hotel management ultimately did the right thing by us but not without a lot of loud complaining All this being said I wold probably stay at this hotel again if I couldnt book into something better Crystal  The pool and fitness area are particularly nice  
N => Weve found our new favourite Montreal hotel We thought we would try this new hotel out and were very pleased  The staff was friendly the room was spacious and the hotel spotlessly clean  Just note that the bathroom only has a shower stall   mind you its two person shower stall but if youre looking for a hot bath after a long day of site seeing    youll be out of luck thats the only bad thing I have to say   everything else was wonderful  
N => Enjoyed the rooftop but layout of rooms odd Stayed at the hotel during a conference  Found it a bit far away from main shopping area  We did walk to Mont Royal from the hotel however as well as old town  Connection to subway and rail are right across the street  All of the employees of the hotel were friendly and helpful  We did think the meals in the restaurant a bit on the expensive side  We enjoyed the rooftop pool The room was average and the light from the smoke detector annoying the beds were comfortable  if I were physically challenged I would find this a difficult hotel to get around in due to the stairs to and from your room to the lobby  
N => So comfortable But a few problems    My husband amp I stayed at this hotel for  nights during the International Jazz Festival  First the good The beds are extraordinarily comfortable I did not want to get out of them  The rooms are nicely orated and modern as is the foyer amp hotel lobby  We truly enjoyed the rooftop pool which was a warm comfortable temperature after a long day of sightseeing  I liked having the elevator take us up and away from the activity down below into the quiet lobby of the hotel  The metro is conveniently located below the building but a long long walk  Now the problems signage was the first  We had difficulty finding the hotel even with the address amp map because the sign is on the side of the building  The driveway is easy to miss because there are no signs  Frustrating when you are driving in from out of town during rush hour  When we checked in we were told we had our choice of the following rooms a room with  double beds or a room with a queen bed  Upon further inquiry about the queen we discovered it was actually a queen pull out sofa located in a suite where the hotel had already rented the bedroom portion of the suite to someone else I will note here that we did book the room at a very low rate on priceline com   but that is no excuse for offering a pull out sofa and calling it a bed We chose the double beds and were very satisfied Another problem our room had a grassy weedy area outside the window with k laying around mostly what appeared to be unused electrical fixtures  Very ugly and made the view look like something out of a cheap motel I am posting a picture  In addition there was a hallway door that opened out onto the ky area which allowed anyone who opened it to stand right outside our window even though we were on the th floor I was actually standing next to the window wearing next to nothing when the door opened and I quickly drew the curtains leaving our room in darkness Since our visit coincided with the jazz festival a major event in Montreal we asked the concierge about getting tickets to a particular concert  He looked at the event calendar then said the event was invitation only so we couldnt go  Not very helpful  Later as we walked around the city we entered the Hyatt and asked their concierge about the same concert  Even though we said we were not guests at the Hyatt the concierge was very friendly made a few calls drew us a map and showed us exactly where to go  All we had to do was go to the venue of the concert and buy tickets  The Hilton concierge should have been able to figure that out  The Hyatt concierge also recommended a fabulous restaurant Restaurant ien    great food great service And finally although the hotel lobby and rooms were elegant and comfortable the hallways had carpeting that looked  years old was fraying and threadbare in places Even with these problems we would stay here again if we got a good rate  I would not pay more than night for this hotel  
N => This fussy traveler had an excellent experience As the title reads Im a fussy traveler  I expect to get what I pay for  Ive worked in the hotel and restaurant industry and I expect to receive the same level of service that I myself have delivered  My experience at the Hotel Bonaventure was excellent  From the moment I arrived to the morning I checked out reluctantly I found this to be a superior hotel in an excellent location  I never experienced any of the negative items mentioned by the other reviewers  While it is true that there are some steps and the layout is a bit labyrinthine we had no trouble locating our room or other hotel amenities  The hotel is conveniently located across the street from Gare Central and the Bonaventure Metro Station  My wife and I were delighted to find that we had all of Montreal easily accessible  While I dont want to cast aspersions the reviewer who said that this hotel was not located near any food was completely mistaken  A large quotfood courtquot is located just inside of Gare Central  Now when I say quotfood courtquot dont think of the fast food blight in a local mall  This food court had a large variety of cuisine and while not a  star dining experience it was certainly a great place to have a quick lunch or a bite to eat between meals My wife and I had an amazing time in Montreal and this hotel was a significant part of our experience  When we return to the city we will stay at the Bonaventure  
N => Nice Staff Stayed at Bonaventure  I called before and asked if every room was accessable  I was told it would be fine  But alas our floor was accessable by four sets of steps  Strange design rather like a maze Hotel was well situated and close to many attractions  Used the underground to walk to many places when it rained  Great bakery Staff was helpful and had valuable suggestions Executive lounge was o k  but not fanastic like the European Hilton executive lounges  Served a few appetizers each night and were varied  Staff were friendly Pool were always crowded when it wasnt raining and it was always impossible to find a chaise Would return again Went to a great steak house named Vargas  
N => Very good stay This is one of those hotels where one would have to search to find anything that was not quite right  The staff was excellent  Very helpful in finding us restaurants tours etc  The gardens at the hotel added to the ambiance Resteraunt was very good   Great omlets   they bring them to your table   you do not have to hover while waiting for it to be finished The hotel is connected to the underground which in another plus   within walking distance to Old Town  A great stay  
N => Pricey stairs stairs and more stairs and no hot water water Stayed at the Hilton Bonaventure  Years ago I ran into Prince Philip in the elevator there  Both previous stays poolside during glorious hot Montreal spring days  I had forgotten that the place is like an Andrew Lloyd Wright maze  After hours walking the City the last thing I wanted to do was climb up and down staircases to find my room so I moved on to Hotel Gouverneur Place Dupuis  Not as much ambience but far more accessilbe  comfortable  They charge   a minute for internet at Hilton  And the water in the bedroom Never did get warm enough to have a shower 
N => Perfect location kind staff I really had a good time in this hotel  The rooms are clean and big enough  The views werent good at all we were facing a dirty strange park but it was bright enough  Not a big fan of Hilton Hotels but would definetly go back to this one Perfect location right next to Place Bonaventure  Good subway connections too  Friendly staff  Perfect for a couple of nights 
N => good for couples or business travel My husband and I just came back from a weekend away in Montreal where we stayed here  The room was nice and clean  The bed was super comfy and there were  pillows to choose from in our King room unfortunately none of them were to my husbands liking resulting in a sore kneck  The room was a nice size spacious with a high ceiling  There were hardly any drawers to unpack our clothes which was a hasle  The bathroom was clean and a fair size but their was no fan I keep staying at hotels with no fans in the bathrooms and I dont understand why  I really liked the rooftop pool but wouldnt recommend it for young children  The shallowest part is  quot  We opted out of eating at the hotel restaurant because of the price and because of all the other options  This hotel is very central to everything Bell Centre shopping dining and a short distance to the casino and BioDome  I would stay here again if it was just my husband and I but would choose another hotel if we brought our dhter  FYI  this hotel does not have its own parking lot  You have to pay to park underground  Be prepared to give your keys to an attendent because they let in more cars then they have spots which means cars have to park in front of other cars and then have to be moved by the attendent whenever the other car has to get out  
N => Hated this hotel We stayed in this hotel during our honeymoon in Montreal  When we visited Montreal the heat was unreal  It was  degrees celsius everyday  We ided to cool down with a drink by the pool  It was quite busy at the poolside the one waitress was running around serving drinks  We understood that she was busy and sat patiently waiting for the drinks menu to be brought over  We waited  mins before she even came near us with the menu  This waitress then went on her break and the only other waiter there was too busy cleaning the bar to notice anyone around him  We sat another  minutes before we gave up waiting and went to the bar to get the drinks  When we got to the bar the waiter looked up from his cleaning and said Theres no more food orders today  We said we wanted drinks but he continued to clean the bar  After a couple more minutes my husband and I were too angry to wait any further  We went to reception to make a complaint  We explained we were on our honeymoon and that the severe lack of service had put a downer on things  We didnt even get an apology from the management  I wouldnt recommend this hotel to my worst enemy 
N => Excellent Service We received excellent service from everyone at this Hilton  However the layout is bizarre and the room was just okay  Location was good  minute walk to old Montreal  min walk to Ste Catharine on a metro stop and across from the train station  If you get a deal worth the stay but for night Id try something else  
N => Mildly dated but comfortable clean and very good service Our experiences matched very closely those of other positive reviewers  The structure is unusual with hotel rooms ringing a central pool which was delightful and mildly dated  However the rooms have been reated and are very comfortable  The memorable feature of our stay was the feeling that the staff really went out of their way to be helpful including letting us check in well before noon and allowing us to stay past  pm the next day  Wed be happy to return     
N => Nice hotel My boyfriend and I visit Montreal often and ided to try the Hilton  It is a really nice hotel but not spectacular I liked the location the best  If you wanted to go shopping then you didnt need to go outside to get to the mall very convenient in the Winter  I also liked swimming in the heated outdoor pool surrounded by snow  a nice touch The room was nice  I liked how we had a flat screen TV  The bathroom was also nice  Everything in the room was obviously recently updated Only had a couple of negatives  our mini fridge did not work so we had them replace it since we wanted to keep some food in our room  Also there was construction going on but we did not hear this  We only found this out when we followed the signs to the pool from our room and realized with another few people that the signs did not actually lead to the pool but to the construction which ends with a dead end so you need to turn around and go back  Also the drinks in the lobby were REALLY good but they were a little expensive Overall I really liked this hotel and the deal we got for the two nights we stayed was really worth it  I would recommend staying here  
N => Nice hotel Concierge a little slow The good Hotel was impeccably clean and the or in the reated rooms is fantastic  Hallways are quotehquot but the rest of it is good  Pool was beautiful and really neat although it should have been about  degrees warmer  I would stay here again for sure as the location was great too  Very easy to find easy to get to things if it werent so freakin cold See my comments about the concierge below  La Source toiletries are fabulousThe negative Front Desk  We booked the reservation about  weeks in advance and upon arrival were surprised to learn that the hotel had switched our  bed room to a King bed room  Their response seesawed between quotsorry we ran out of those roomsquot and quotwell you booked it as a king quot Nevermind the fact that we had called to confirm this  times the week before   so be VERY careful  Luckily I was holding the printed piece of paper that confirmed what I said so they had to give us a room with  beds even after calling me a liar  This is usually when you get upgraded to executive floor for free or I dont know   an apology but that didnt happen to us  Oh well  It worked out Concierge   Chantal seemed friendly but failed to mention that when she tells a guest something is quotjust  blocks awayquot she means via the underground  I was more than a little ticked after walking a mile by  blocks she meant  in what I consider a blizzard and walking into a classy restaurant looking like a yeti  Im not ignorant I knew there was an underground city but to obviously first time tourists this kind of thing bears at least a vague reference to the fact that you dont have to go outside in the monster snowstorm  Youd think she would have mentioned that once especially when I said quotI guess we should take a cab in this snowquot and she said quotoh no its a short walk quotNickeling and Diming Even Motel  gives you free in room coffee  Seriously  And you can get wireless internet at the Holiday Inn Express and at every rest stop in VT but not at this hotel Construction noise  Nothing like a saw at  AM to say quothello thats why this fabulous room was only  a night quot 
N => Great Hotel a bit on the old side though Only stayed for one night to go out in Montreal Stayed in an executive room the room was great  Bathroom a bit on the small side though Hotel pool is fantastic outside swimming in   degrees that night that was quite amazing Hotel staff is very friendly and efficient The only thing I was disappointed with was the executive lounge which was a bit odd but the food was good was weird to have to pay for alcoholic drinks    usually at Hilton Executive lounges they dont charge you    
N => LOVED IT I got a good deal on bonjourquebec com  It worked out to be just under night but between  ppl it wasnt bad  The room was very large and the bed was one of the most comfortable I ever slept in The pool was awesome    nice size and lots of lounge chairs surrounding it  Our room happened to be on the lower level so it backed out right on to the garden and the pool was just steps away  I felt like I was in Florida   not in the middle of a busy city  The idea of putting a hotel on a rooftop and connecting it to the sous terrain was a great one indeed  
N => Too Pricey for what it can offer We stayed here last   amp st  The location was great  It was close to Rue St  Catherine where there are lots of shops and restaurants  The rooms are clean but the hallway to the rooms is not that impressive  To get to our rooms we had to take the stairs which we would not have mind if we did not travel with  kids on strollers  Ramps were nowhere to be found en route to the rooms  The ice machines were broken  We thought the only ice machine that wasnt working was the one closest to us but when we walked further to the other ice machine it was broken too  In fact it was already displaced from its section be in an attempt to fix it  There were no signs on the machine saying its out of order or where can we find another one thats working  When we approached the front desk they knew exactly where to get ice as if they already knew that a couple of them were not working  In addition to that we already tried getting ice from those machines earlier that day and ended up going to the front desk to ask for ice  By the next day or later that night they were still not working  I have to say the staff are nice though very helpful and courteous The day we checked out we got the bill for the  rooms we got and ended up paying   for  nights  We thought that was a lot considering we were there on the weekday and supposedly those were discounted rate  There were about  to  lines on the bill that said taxes  But I guess thats just Canada   lots of taxes  Oh how can I forget the parking  You would think youll get free parking if youre a hotel guest or at least get a discounted price for being a guest  NOT For self park you have to pay   for  hours across the street and you cant go in and out  To use the Hotel valet that will cost you   for  hrs but at least you can go in and out  And of course you have to tip them too  In the long run it is better to use the valet if you are going to be driving your car a lot and going back and forth to your hotel  
N => Loved it Been here on Business trip got a corporate rate and worth every buckof it well I didnt have to pay for it location was convient had access to metro station bus station which was definatly a plus for me food was good and loved the heated pool  The rooms very clean spacious and comfy room service was good as well  The only thing I did not like was the TV Cable it only had around  channels and the weather channel was snowy and could not make it out I ended being soaked that day after not knowing what the weather would be like in the afternoon  Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice and clean and convient place to stay if you do not mind the extra dollars  
N => Great hotel My sister and I stayed at the Hilton in ember for  days just before Christmas  My sister had to be there on business so I tagged along to do some last minute Christmas shopping  I was a little leary of staying here after having read some reviews  I had no choice in hotel as it was booked by my sisters company But all those fears were unfounded Yes the hotel is on the upper floors of an office building but you certainly dont get that sense when you are in the hotel  The actual interior of the lobby bar area is a little dated but is clean inviting and the staff very friendly and helpful  We were directed to our room on a second level   there was no elevator but it was no big deal  There were a few wide steps to go up to our floor and I did note that they had a ramp for wheelchairs  Our bags were brought to our room in a timely fashion so we didnt even have to contend with bringing them up the few stairs  Now the hallways of the rooms could be reated but that  be in the works as the one end of rooms were being reated and I understand are the other rooms  Despite this going on about  to  rooms away from ours we heard nothing Our room was beautiful   it had just been reated and was very modern and beautifully orated  The beds were extremely comfortable the bathroom spacious and the room itself large  The bar area was quiet and comfortable   we had several nightcaps over the length of our stay  The hotel itself was quiet    there were Christmas parties going on in several ballrooms but they were not bothersome in the least  It was absolutely great having the underground city access right there and after figuring out how to access it you didnt need to see the light of day at all while shopping All in all we had a wonderful stay   everyone was great from the reception staff the bar staff to the valets out front  
N => This place was OK My wife and I drove to Montreal with another couple from Niagara falls after getting a good quote over the phone the layout is a bit strange as when you walk in the front entrance that didnt look like a hotel you need to take an elevator upto the lobby I heard the place was originally for olympic athletes and then turned into a hotel this probably explains the layout  We checked into what we thought would be identical rooms as we paid the same price no ours was pretty small compared to the room my friend was given  The outdoor pool was good  The hotel is in a pretty good location and looked clean I would try a different hotel next time though  Concierge were helpful and got us tickets to see the Canadiens play although we all got nose bleeds 
N => Be warned   No elevators Stayed here for a weekend getaway in ust   me and  kids  Check in fine but then we tried to go to our room  Despite seeing me check in with  small children and a baby in a stroller I was booked in a room as far away from the entrance as possible and up as many flights of stairs as possible  The hotel is set on   floors all connected by short flights of stairs   there were  flights of stairs to get to our room and no elevator After I complained they directed me through a back hallway to a service elevator that meant that I quotonlyquot had to take the stroller up  flights of stairs  Rooms OK   not updated except for bathroom filthy carpet   not what youd expect at a Hilton   there are much nicer rooms for the same price in Montreal Would have been OK if not for the fact that we could not get to our room without dragging a stroller upstairs  They really ought to warn you about this on their website Definitely avoid this place if you have a stroller if you are at all physically disabled or you do not want to walk LONG distances  
N => Worst Hotel Ever I have to agree with the majority concerning this hotel    it was horrendous I had originally checked in for  days but checked out after the first night  Right from the start the staff was horrible rude and werent experienced by any standard  I think if I stayed at an Econo Lodge I wouldve found better service and quality Ive stayed at hotels across every major continent and almost   of those were either  star but this hotel was no where close to being a four star  The carpet was stained in several places the sheets had holes in it the or was tiredoveruseddingy and best of all the TV didnt work  Since I came back from my meeting late at night I didnt discover the problem till late  After calling I was told that no one was available till the morning  The or of the hotel is very worn and hotel breadspreads were something I figured they have had to have used for at least  years now  I complained to the staff politely the next morning but found that they didnt care to rectify the situation  I dont recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely not waste your money in this questionable establishment  
N => Not great but not bad We stayed overnight for a night away from the kids while visiting in laws  We had a room with a king sized bed  room was pretty plain and bare  No frills there But it was clean  On two arate occasions I had two different housekeepers let themselves in the room while we were present  Not good The view from the room was of what I assume were the gardens but it was all snow and the room is below the ground level so half of the view was below gardens themselves meaning no view at all  The front desk staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations for shopping and dining  Common areas were nice and clean  nicer than the rooms  This is definitely NOT a four star hotel but through Priceline we got a ent price nonetheless  
N => Good enough Nothing special about this hotel at first appearance but this is where service makes all the difference  All of the staff are not only friendly but anxious to please Do beware however if using the Executive Lounge  Drinks will run you C  plus tax and you are expected to tip on top of that self serve honor bar    the attendants will bring you some canapes and count your cocktails  
N => I felt like I was in a poorly orated bomb shelter    I would only recommend you stay at this hotel if you need a heated pool on a rooftop garden in almost total isolation it seems from the city below  The roomshallways are dark and dank very s clean but really drab  I wouldnt pay more than  to stay here again and even then Id try to get out of it  They tried to charge me twice for the expensive internet access the Holiday Inn I moved to the next time had it for FREE and it was wireless  I found nothing appealing about this place  Worst of all is the hike through an empty strange convention center corridor to get to the little vestibule to get in the elevator to go up to the lobby entering from the Metro side  If you drive up to the hotel its a bit better on that side   but still goofy  GOOFY thats a good word to describe this place  Just avoid it  PS I did enjoy the neutrogena soaps and Crabtree and Evlyn stuff     but that cannot be a real reason to return  Can someone explain to me why they put so many little steps up and down in this hotel Made pulling your suitcase seem like hiking  I better stop   this place just aint right  
N => This hotel is an just unmitigated disaster Anyone writing a good review for this hotel must be employed by Hilton  It was the worst hotel experience ever  When we entered our quotnon smokingquot room it was just full of smoke  The reception admitted that quotit was technically a smoking room but they believed it was adequate for usquot  To sumize Rude staff bad food dated rooms and terrible surroundings  
N => Good value through priceline Ok place to stay pretty lobby excellent value through priceline no views to speak of pool is different  outside heated open all year no hot tub nice bar valet parking service is excellent  
N => abolutely fabulous the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in its absolutely gorgeous to wake up and look outside to see nothing but this beautiful green landscaped forest complete with ducks and fish the breakfast buffet was sufficient to keep us satisfied for hours and the waiters were only too happy to oblige with all and every request great location right above underground shopping city and within walking distance to just about anywhere including the old port chinatown and even St  Catherine Street Next time in Montreal I would not even consider staying anywhere else   I was sorry to leave  
N => Not a  star hotel My husband and I booked the Hilton through Hotwire for my birthday  We were there e  to y   We checked in around  after driving around Place Bon Aventure trying to locate the entrance of the hotel  We pulled into the parking lot to find out that we were in the right place When we arrived at the reception counter the gentleman took forever checking us in  He even had to get some help in doing so  After  minutes to check into a room that has been prepaid for we end up getting a non smoking room After getting our correct room we started our adventure  After a long day of walking we came back to our hotel with the loudest clanking noise you have ever heard  We were thinking it was the air conditioning  I turned it off and the noise was still there  So we called the front desk and was told security would come and check it out  After half an hour of waiting and getting a head ache my husband went down to reception for answers  They told him the only solution was to switch rooms  So a bell boy was being sent to take us to the new room  The bell boy was nice and he temporarily fixed the noise problem in our current room but we did not want to take the chance that it could wake us up at  am  When we got to our new room surprise surprise we were placed in a non smoking room  After all the hassles we did not care anymore  We just smoked in there  I apologize to those non smokers out there who are offended that they end up getting non smoking rooms that smell smoky but we had had enough of the crap dished out to us  The hotel rooms and pool was nice the location was great just wished that service was a lot more attentive efficient and organized for a  star hotel  The fact that is was a long holiday really did not apply  We were far enough away from all the touristy places and pricey enough that the hotel wasnt even that busy  
N => avoid at all cost Worst hotel we have ever stayed at  We were put in a smoking room despite our booking clearly read non smoking  Upon arrival we even double checked at the front desk and were assured that the room was indeed non smoking which turned out not to be the case  The staff is unfriendly and not up to the job  The breakfast had a very small selection of choiches one of them cooked not fried bacon  Stay away and avoid at all cost  There are many much better hotels in Montreal with better locations at the same price  
N => Bonaventure does not deserve   rating We recently stayed at the Bonaventure for  days  I would not consider the Hotel Bonaventure a  Star hotel by any means  When we arrived they would not accept my Hilton Platinum number  Why I do not know  This is the first hotel to refuse a Platinum card  I requested a non smoking room with a short walking distance preferably an ADS room  Our first room was at the very end of the hotel a walk of approximately   mile  Our second room was changed to the front of the hotel  There was construction going on in the bulling below  Which we were not informed about when I called the hotel a few days earlier  Our room was above the jack hammering  This was unacceptable  I wanted a change but had to wait until the next day  The Jack hammering started at  am lasted until  pm  Since we went to the Casino we came in rather late  We really wanted to sleep  Oh well Got a room change the next day this room was acceptable but dimly lighted the TV went in and out and the maid service did not leave any wash clothes  I inquired about that and the guest information told me that they were short on wash clothes so it was a hit or miss distribution  I also found the front desk to be rather rude  We did not have a do not disturb sign in the room  I called for one  Did not seem to matter  The do not disturb sign was placed on the door but we were awakened by a knock at  am  So much for sleep  The next afternoon my husband was using the bathroom facilities and in ches the maid without knocking  Thank goodness he had the bathroom door partially closed  Be aware that the breakfast served at the hotel is   CAD which you do not know until you get the bill  I think that is extremely overpriced  In addition they are not very helpful with directions  All they ever say is take a taxi  We found out that there is a free Casino bus at night through someone on a tour not through the hotel  Gray Line tours are great  Make sure you take the all day tour to Quebec City  It is worth the price  Go to Notre Dame Basilica and pay the price for admission  Save the ticket it will be honored at other times if you want to return  If you happen to be there on a Sunday from   the organ is playing and it is exceptional  Oh the Casino gives the best exchange rates  By the way we did win but gave it all back  The important thing is we had fun  We were also quite surprised about the general cost of meals  We ate at Jacques Cartier one night  burgers  fries  ice tea were   CAD  If I were to do it over again I would stay in the quaint Quebec City with lots of shops places to eat and attractions  I would go to Montreal as a day trip  
N => not come back I recently spent  days at the Hilton Bonaventure  The hotel was OK  It did not deserve the star rating granted by some websites  The rooms could use some upgrades  The Executive rooms were not any better than the regular rooms  Compared to the Hilton Millenium in New York or the Hilton in Beijing Hilton Bonaventure was like a Motel   The front desk staffs were rude at times  The location is pretty good though  The Executive lounge was closed when I was there  It was supposed to be re opened during my stay but got indefinitely delayed  
N => The room could use some updating The room I had was small but had a great view  Your on top of a high rise directly over train tracks but no noise  The lighting in the room was really bad made the rooms or look worse than it was  The room service was very good  The front desk service was not Its also rather hard to find the outside of the building has no big Hilton sign or anything  Just a tiny placard by the front gate  Also when I was there the st floor area was under construction and the signs to the actual hotel lobby were misleading  
N => Hate the service We went there th of y weekend  I chose Hilton because of its reputation and most importantly it had an outdoor pool  It was definitely an unpleasant experience for us  The receptionist was very unpolite and unhelpful the room was extremely noisy and after the first night I asked them to change it at least they were fine with it  The hotel was extremely crowded probably because of the festival  It was impossible to go into the pool because of the families with kids tons of them they also had a dining area right next to the pool which made the pool area extremely crowded and noisy  Needless to say I had no fun at all  Plus the check out person was really unprofessional and I had to report her  The manager was responsive though  I had one of my worst vacations in a  star hotel  The service we received was definitely not even  star  I would never go there again  
N => Great hotel Beautiful hotel  Grounds were well kept  Trees and waterfalls give you a feeling youre anyplace but on top of a building in Montreal  Only bad feature was just one restaurant was open and not necessarily at convenient times  My husband is diabetic and we could not find anything open in the immediate vicinity on a Saturday late afternoon  The staff overall were wonderful   except in the restaurant  They could use some quotfriendlyquot training  
N => Nice hotel in a great location We really liked this hotel although there were some minor problems with our reservation  However they quickly resolved them to our satisifaction  Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful  The location was great and the pool was really nice  We didnt notice the construction noise that the previous reviewer mentioned  
N => Hard to categorize  
N => Cant be beat  
N => No guarantee of room  
N => Les Remparts Parc du Riviere Nord other stuff we loved     
N => Excellent Hotel This hotel was very clean and beautiful as well as comfortable  The staff was very friendly  The airport shuttle was timely and the fact that I could leave my car there for a week at no extra charge was comforting  The shuttle was there again when I came back  I would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to co workers  
N => Excellent hotel great service I stayed here overnight and was very pleased by the personal service I found  Id lost my luggage and had no extra clothes  The shuttle driver they pick up drop off at the airport but also will drive you within a  km radius was kind enough to ask the management if he could take me to a nearby mall where I was able to buy a change of clothes and have a good dinner    both shop and restaurant were his suggestions The hotel was impeccably clean large room with  big beds and plenty of work space free WiFi good breakfast late checkout was no problem  I was most pleased 
N => Pretty neat place My husband and I ided to stay in something familiar before we went into Montreals old quarter  We now wish we had continued here  Our room was modern quotFrenchquot  The floors were of a dark wood  There was a microwave fridge and table to eat upon  The manager sounded so American that I asked him if he was from the states  He said he had seen alot of American movies He also let us know about the food in their freezer that let our very tired selves microwave dinner there at the hotel  The breakfast was excellent  The staff friendly and helpful  Definitely a place we can recommend 
N => Stylish hotel with a few minor glitches We stayed in the Presedential Suite but was a little dissapointed that despite assurances from the booking agent that the room had two erate bedrooms it only had a single bedroom  We complained so they reduced the rate  The room was very hot as the AC was not working and it was ust  The maintenance man came to fix it but gave up after about  minutes  Then it suddenly started working The Sofa bed was very tough to assemble as they had packed it up fully made  When we checked our credit card bill weeks later we saw that the hotel did not reduce the rate as promised  These problems aside the room was very spacious and well appointed  We liked the wooden floors and the bathroom was pretty impressive    for a Holiday Inn  The room came with two large flatscreens which was a nice touch  Breakfast was just OK  The hotel is new and it has a very modern feel about it  
N => Its the perfect hotel This hotel not only has great prices but great service as well  Everything was perfectly clean  I would definitely stay here again 
N => Clean Comfortable   Not close to anything We stayed in a King suite which was very upscale in or  Two flat screen TVs laminate floors and a hudge bath with a glassed in shower The bed was comfortable and the room spacious  The only thing we did not like is the AC was loud and seemed to operate only on high speed  It was alright for sleeping but the TV had to be turned up too loud to suit me  Also there was a pool of water on the floor the next moring where the AC had not been draining properly  I turned the unit off and reported that to the management at check out The staff speaks clear English which is nice because we dont speak French  Not speaking French makes driving in Quebec tricky  Luckily our GPS took us through a maze of roads to this hotel  I dont know if we could have found it without GPS  The location seem convenient to the airport but not much else  That was OK for us since we were only passing through town on the way somewhere else If youve had one HIE breakfast youve had the majority of them  On rare occasions one will stand out  This was not one of those rare occasions  
N => Fantastic for Business Travelers This Holiday Inn Express fulfilled every single need I had for a top notch business hotel  With time at a premium the hotel was able to accommodate me in every way providing great service and rooms all within tight time constraints  Best of all I was able to zip right over to the airport for my flight once my stay was over  Highly recommended  
N => Good hotel at convenient location My family myself wife  year old and  year old stayed three nights  It was a pleasant stay  The room was casual in or spacious and clean  The price was very good as Montreal had a city wide special called the Summer Sweet Deal with the third night  off  The breakfast was ent although it got extremely crowded  The location was very good   right next to Chinatown where you could get some cheap eats at the numerous Vietnamese restaurants  The hotel was also in easy walking distance from the old town  The valet parking was pretty convenient as they retrieved the car quickly  The only real issue that we had was that one could not reserve a crib ahaed of time as they were available only first come first serve  That policy is a bit wrong headed as visitors need to know for certain if they can get a crib we brought our own  
N => Good location but no frills  We only had one day to stay in Montreal after our cruise with Holland America  We stayed here due to the proximity to Chinatown Notre Dame Catherdral and Rue St  Pierre  The room was ent two queen beds and we were fortunate to get early check in arrived around  and the room was still being cleaned up but the maid was nice enough to let us drop off our stuff  Chinatown is relatively small compared to other metro cities but they have some pretty good bakeries  The T stop subway is right across the street so really handy to get to the RESO underground mall  And Notre Dame and Rue St  Pierre is a five minute walk If youre looking for a clean ent room this will suffice  It wasnt fancy or luxurious but for our purposes it was fine  We took the Gray Line tour recommended by the concierge and it was worth it they picked amp dropped off to our hotel  The price for the room was ent too  Free internet was a plus  
N => awful room we were treated like garbage  We arrived in mid afternoon on ust    I had called to verify my reservation the previous Wednesday all was as it was reserved  We took the train to Montreal and walked to our hotel which was convenient  They checked us in quickly as we arrived on our floor we noticed how dingy and dark the hallways were it was in need of some immediate TLC as soon as we entered the room we were in a smokey and smelly room which boasted terrible or and a smelly couch  The flooring was terribly dirty  We are non smokers and my dhter and I are severely sensitive to smoke therefore we had reserved a non smoking room with two queen beds  This was nothing like what we had reserved  When we called down from the room we were told thats all that they had and they would speak to the manager  After several minutes I started to feel ill and we went back downstairs where we were treated like third rate citizens  They had us speak to a man which they claimed was the manager who refused to make changes and refused to check us out  So I gave them their keys back and myself my husband and my small children walked out with them watching knowing fully that we had come on foot and that there were no hotels with rooms avaiblable that weekend  We walked to a nearby hotel who released a room for us DAYS INN on Rene Levesque just a block down the road  When I called the following day as the reservastion was for two nights they did not want to put me through to a manager and they claimed not to be able to check me out early as it was pre paid  We paid  for the two nights  We have travelled throughout Canada USA UK and the Caribbean we have stayed at various types of accommodations we have never NEVER been treated like this  TERRIBLE HOTEL STAFF TERRIBLE ROOM and NO REGARD FOR FAMILIES we had to change our train reservation to return home the following day as there were no hotels available in the downtown core needless to say my children were sadened and we were completely confused as to why in this day and age we would be treated this way  I delayed writing this review because I tried to contact them to see if they could explain apologize and refund our money ALL of which they did NOT do  
N => Never again Booked room via PriceLine good rate  Hotel was obviously under reation our floor was under construction room was well used  I log more than  room nights a year and this was the worst in a long time   by far  
N => Great Location Clean Rooms  Ive been staying at this hotel on a regular basis all summer on business usually Sundays thru Friday mornings but several weeknds as well amp I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone  Is it perfect Of course not  As noted in other reviews the internet service is terribly slow amp not even wireless but at least you get internet service  Ive stayed at hotels with quotfree high speed wirelessquot that barely worked if at all amp the floor hallways seem somehow barren  However I firmly believe the good points of this location far exceed the few deficiencies   All rooms are suites amp they are a fair size as alreadyu noted they are converted condos   Rooms are very clean amp kept clean during your stay   Beds are comfortable but the bed amp bath linens are high quality  very comfortable   Location wise for tourists it cannot be beat  You are in the heart of Montreal    literally a minute amp a half to the corner of Ste Catherine amp St  Laurent ditto Chinatown  A ten minute walk to the heart of Old Montreal amp during quotfestival seasonquot you are one to seven minutes away from a festival  Just for Lhs Mntrl Intl JazzFest Franco Folies    you name it    all summer long something for everyone   Walk in rates     I had friends from home driving through Mntrl  amp they spontaneously ided to stay the night amp enjoy the beautiful city with me for an evening  They got a rate of something just under CAN    this is fantastic given location amp all the other pluses this hotel has to offfer   Although I cant think of his name very embarrasing the who I assume to be senior valet parking gentleman was tops  always with a friendly smile a funny little story amp a willingness to help you out in a flash  The rest of the staff are also just fine but this fellow was a wonder  definitely worth mentioning him in the plus sectionCant really say more than I amp other posters have said already including a ent free breakfast with hot items except I urge you to consider this place of you are visiting as a tourist  convenient location alone makes this well priced hotel an outstanding choice 
N => Room breakfast was nice  Issues with the service of the hotel  Good Things We went for  night with our   month old son the location was great just a short walk from the Old Port area and the shops on St  Catherine  We pushed a stroller around a both days so location was key  We got the room for  with parking and buffet breakfast included  So the rate was pretty good  The room or was dated but it was very clean and the room was a good size  queen breakfast in the morning was good for your basic hot buffet Bad Things The internet was useless it was slower then dialup  I used my PDA instead thankfully it was just to lookup some addresses  We requested a crib when booking the room then asked again when we checked in at pm when we got back from dinner the crib still wasnt in the room so we called the front desk and asked where it was  They said they would send it right up  About an hour later they called back and said they had no cribs available  They didnt offer any alternatives and just asked if there was anything else  Not impressed  The next morning we complained and the manager just said quotcribs are not guaranteed its first come first servedquot  I argued that we asked while checking in and were told it would be no problem to get a crib otherwise we would have request  beds or cancelled and gone somewhere else since the two of us got no sleep as we were afraid of rolling onto our son  She just kept saying its not guaranteed  We ended up with a   discount  I would have rather slept  
N => Cool for a business Trip Had to be in Montrel for a week for a business meeting I preferred staying close to downtown Montreal so that I could walk to the office  This was a wonderful hotel in downtown Montreal   CAD   night  It was close to all the attractions in Old Montreal as well  Infact i was lucky since we had Jazz festival the whole week i stayed over there and even luckier since the location of the festival was a walkable distance from the hotel  The room was pretty and very comfortable  Infact i forgot my shaving kit and the hotel staff provided a ent one for free We had a good complimentary continental breakfast My stay was memorable there  If you are looking to stay in downtown Montreal i would recommend this hotel if you are looking for options other than the Hilton  
N => Not bad  This hotel looked like it was converted from a former condo building because the rooms were very large and spacious  The daily breakfast was up to standard and housekeeping did a fine job  To get to the closest Metro stop one had to go through a somewhat run down part of town  The second closest Metro stop is much farther away through Chinatown My only beef with this hotel is that when I checked out I was forced to pay a ridiculous extra fee of some sort by clueless front desk staff  Thanfully this was promptly and courteously reversed after I complained to the hotel manager upon return home  
N => Good Location Great Service Standard Holiday Inn Express   which is great as I seek these out when I can for their value and excellent free breakfast  This one is in a good location in Montreal on a main thoroughfare and not far from the Metro  We were able to walk most places we wanted to go but used the Metro so as not to exhaust ourselves  Our room was a queen suite two rooms with a kitchenette  High speed internet was wired but free  The TV had extensive channels included in both French and English  Amenities included were shampoo soap and bath gel which was nice  The shower head was low even I at quot needed to duck a bit to get under it  The clock radio had a dual alarm which was a nice touch  The kitchenette featured a full size refrigerator microwave and electric coffee pot as well as plenty of cabinet space  As ours was just a two night stay we did not get to use it The complementary breakfast was wonderful  This one had hot entrees the first day scrambled eggs and bacon the next had cheese omelets and sausage patties  The attendants had trouble keeping the food stocked as demand was high  I had planned to have one of the world class cinnamon rolls on my last morning there alas they ran out and were not restocked before I had to leave  Coffee is available all day long here Parking is by Valet and is an additional charge  Cars are stored in an underground garage  You will want to take advantage of this as we did see an unfortunate car owner nearby whose car had been broken into by shattering the window  An odd thing did happen   the Valet rung our room with a cryptic message stating something quotperhaps comicalquot had occurred without revealing details on the phone  We ran down immediately to check out the issue seems he had knocked a cup of coffee we left in the car cupholder   but as far as we could tell nothing spilled on the car somehow the entire thing spilled into his pocket  We were grateful for his quotheads upquot but would have appreciated more detail about this inconsequential event on the phone as he inspired great worry on our part  Nonetheless kind and he did not have to alert us at all Chinatown is just two blocks away and we were within an easy walk of Old Montreal  We took advantage of the outdoor ice skating rink there which was fantastic  The rink is well used but it seems the ice is groomed about every     hours  With music playing it was lovely  We were within easy walk of the downtown shopping but you  want to hop onto the Metro for a top or three to save your legs  We atteded the Titanic Exhibition at the Eaton Center and highly recommend this well done moving presentation Were planning a return trip for the summer and will not hesitate to stay here again 
N => One of my Montreal Favs Booked two jr suites expecting each to be one large room with arate sitting areas but they were actually two arate rooms WITH BALCONYS great view    Breakfast was typical Holiday Inn Express fare    lots to choose from and good quality    my little sister still talks about their cranberry juice i dont like cranberry juice so i cant offer an opinion but she insists its great  only complaint was no pool but the hotel was made for business people who probably dont use it anyway    
N => OK for your first visit to Montreal I selected this hotel based on previous experiences with HIE and was a bit disappointed  The location is OK   you can walk to several good areas within  minutes but there is little to nothing close to the hotel  Be warned the hotel is not all suites  I booked through a rd party website and that was root of my bad experience there  I was given a non suite room on the rd floor   a smoking floor not my preference  If you like smoking the rd floor is for you  Not only does it reek of smoke during my stay there were cigarette butts in the hallway for two days  The staff was friendly enough but did remind me twice that I didnt book directly with the hotel  I was a second class citizen  The buffet breakfast was great except for a busy Sunday morning when they were overwhelmed and broke down everything  hours before finishing time  I guess they ran dry  It was OK for my first time to Montreal in terms of location but I wont be staying there again  
N => Great location great value We stayed three nights in tember  at the Holiday Inn Express located approx  m northwest of Place Jacques Cartier in Old Montreal and  km northeast of Downtown  All attractions are in perfect walking distance  If you like to take the metro it s just m to the station Champ de s  Valet parking cost   CAD extra  Check in was friendly and efficient  We had a clean comfortable and surprisingly large sized queen bed suite with a arated kitchen and living room  Our quiet room   had a tiny balcony with a view towards Old Montreal  The complimentary breakfast was good   They offered toast English muffins juice fruits cereals cheese boiled eggs cake etc   However there were not always enough seats  All in all a great place to stay  
N => Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was a great place to stay  It was within easy walking distance of the main streets of downtown and it was very easy to get to the metro from the hotel so we had access to any attraction we wanted to go to  It was also only a short walk away from the greyhound station making it easy to walk with our luggage to the hotel The rooms were very good and a very reasonable price  Upon arriving we found that our room instead of being a small single room as we expected was actually a full suit with a second lounge room and a small kitchen  The entire hotel was very clean and the continental breakfast was not bad either The hotel staff were very helpful and informative  They gave us clear directions to any place we asked of them and were very knowledgeable about all the attractions in the city and were able to give us recommendations of where to go  They also were very quick to help out with any special requests for your room i e  a second set of sheets Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Montreal due to its knowledgeable staff great value comfortable accommodations and great location  
N => Not a bad spot Just back from the Montreal Jazz Festival  We chose this hotel because my sister and her husband were supposed to join us with their  month old son in their own room  We thought it would be a good place for people with kids in tow  They were unable to join us but the hotel did not disappoint  As advertised our room was a suite or more appropriately a small apartment  The bedroom was a ent size with TV cabinet night stands and closet  The bedding was nice although the mattress a bit soft  The bathroom was typical Holiday Inn nothing fancy    bring your own soap if you hate those mini bars of soap  The kitchen was great   full sized fridge microwave sink and dishwasher  There were dishes plates glasses silverware etc  The living room was a ent size w couch desk chair and another TV  The heatingcooling system took some getting used to but we managed as we needed both during our stay  The staff was reasonably pleasant  The housekeepers were very nice and the room was kept nice and clean  All in all no complaints  Not fancy but perfectly acceptable and great location from St  Catherine Street where the main festival activities were located  Walking distance for most downtown attractions including Old Montreal and Chinatown  Some side streets a little shabby w strip joints etc  but stay on the main streets to avoid if thats not your cup of tea  Enjoy 
N => Exceptionnal value great service Rooms are large and very comfortable  Looks like it was reorated very recently  arate bedroom kitchenette and full size fridge microwave are very practical  Might not be the funkiest spot in town but close to everything  Staff was always friendly and efficient  Strongly recommended  
N => Okay Not Great Overall the hotel was alright for the price paid  While there was air conditioning in the living area we were disappointed that the bedroom a erate area was no air conditioned  Noise level was very loud at the hotel  The hotels reasonable prices and proximity to Sainte Catherine Street make it a popular choice for young people heading up to Montreal for partying  There was constant partying in the rooms next to us and in the hallways and hotel was reluctant andor unable to do anything about it  A big plus was its location very close to Old Montreal and Saint Denis Streets two locations that contain some of the best restaurants in the city  
N => Wonderful for holiday inn express First off let me just say this is in a fine neighborhood  I felt safer in this neighborhood than in many neighborhoods in Boston  You could easily walk to Old Montreal the grocery store IGA the Latin Quarter and could easily catch a cab out in front of the hotel  As with any urban setting I wouldnt recommend that one walk alone but I would say the same to someone walking in the city in New York Seattle or San Francisco It was really cold when we visited Montreal but we still felt comfortable and found it quite easy to walk from the hotel to different places in the city  The hotel valet parking was reasonable especially considering that all guests have in and out priveleges and it is is affordable compared to other area hotels We had a great queen suite room that was clean  When requested the front desk provided disposable plates and silverware for us to eat our take out  If you are planning on eating a significant meal in your room make sure you bring your own dishesmaterials  The staff was friendly and welcoming and were eager to show us how to get places on a city map they provided  When the concierge didnt know where a small out of the way restaurant we were going to recommended to us by locals he called the restaurant and pinpointed it on the map  Overall the staff was very nice The included breakfast was very comprehensive on the weekends including quottoastablequot waffles muffins fruit hard boiled eggs cereal bagels english muffins and more  The staff at breakfast was very prompt about replenishing breakfast supplies  On the weekdays there was less overall food but the same selection    this was okay as there were less guests We found the restaurant very easily  Just use map quest or drive down Rene Levesque and you should be able to find it  We asked for a high floor with a view and were given a great room on the th floor the top hotel floor    there are condos up on above floors  The only problem with the room was that it was really dry because Montreal was having a couple of dry cold days  We had a great view of the old city though  It was wonderful The price was great compared to other comparable places  We got an  USD deal for a queen suite room from the Holiday Inn website  Dont waste your money going somewhere else Overall a great experience that I would recommend to anyone  
N => not too easy to find First impressionNice hotel but not too easy to find  We passed the hotel several times without being able to see the entrance sign which is badly positioned  But eventually we got into the hotel and were quite happy with our spacious and well appointed room  Other reviews mentioned the neighborhood but to me its like a typical one for a big city  Old Montreal is only  minutes away by foot and the busy downtown witch has some really shabby spotscan be reached in less than  minutes  the next metro station e g  for visiting the olympic stadium is also just a short stroll away  So alltogether the holidy inn express is a good choice if you want to explore Montreal  
N => Definitely a great place to stay We stayed at this hotel from t    I only have great things to say about this Holiday Inn Express  The room was really clean and very spacious  The bed was very soft with a fluffy comforter  There was a kitchenette with fridge microwave and sink  The kitchen and the free breakfast was not really necessary since Chinatown was only  blocks away and we can go eat there any time  But those ammenities were still nice to have  Theres free internet in the business center  The gym was not bad also even had a TV in there  The metro was about  blocks away on the other side of Chinatown  Vieux Montreal was about  blocks away  So the location was very convenient  There was always people walking around at all times of the day or night so its pretty safe to walk around at night  I would definitely stay at this Holiday Inn Express if I was to visit Montreal again 
N => We were disappointed with the service  We made our reservation for  people and found the sofa bed to be unmade  We had to request sheets and then make up the bed ourselves  Also the air conditioning unit was a free standing unit which was very loud and took up a lot of space  Service was OK but not great  The area did not seem too good  We were told to make sure that we parked in an underground parking garage so that the car would be undamaged in the morning  
N => Good hotel here are some important tips for future visitors This Holiday Inn express provides good value for the not very inexpensive price  The big rooms and the kitchenette the breakfast and free internet are all important to me in a hotel and this hotel comes through on all counts However visitors should know the following in advance  the kitchenette has NO dishes utensils not even glasses  Bring your own bring some up from breakfast or you will not be able to use the kitchen   There is absolutely no way we could find to avoid the parking charge which seems to be up to  a day with taxes this becomes  a day   This has been said before   many rooms do not have AC in both the living area and bedroom  We travel with two little kids and the living area was not air conditioned  The vents are not connected to anything  The bedroom had a portable AC unit and by the time we had everything unpacked we were too lazy to ask to be moved   so make sure in advance  This is sort of trivial but     canadian is actually  more per night    a night city tax and two more taxes added on   so budget accordinglyThe reception and parking staff were very helpful the other staff could be better we had a toilet overflow and while it was repaired when we were out of the room the sewage soaked towels were left on the bathroom floor  Also we had a maid enter the room despite the quotdo not disturbquot sign we carefully placed the night before All this said we had a great time having the extra room was a real bonus and we would stay there again  
N => Highly Recommend  
N => Great Hotel but we didnt enjoy Montreal  
N => Can HIGHLY recommend this hotel  
N => terrific place  
N => Different experience Some friends and I spent a night at this hotel before leaving the next day for New Brunswick  We were taking the train so we ided to stay close to the train station which is just minutes away from the airport  We were surprised when we were walking to our rooms  It felt like we were on some Tropical island  Very cool very different  We had a swim the lifeguard was a nice guy very helpful  Really nice staff all in all  We would go back anytime  
N => perfect stay We really liked it here there are two swimming pools a fitness and the shuttle service to the airport works very well  The food in the restaurant was very well also a great vegatarian dish  We could relax here before our flight to Amsterdam and our room was near the swimming pool  Also the room had everything we needed and the reception was very nice to us  
N => First time there and last We stayed there  nights and had  rooms  The room that our teenagers stayed in was smelling awful the coffee percolator was not working  Our room looked ok however it needs painting and the walls are dirty When I mentioned this to the agent on duty when we checked out that the room was smelly he did not apologize at all like it was normal  Perhaps the bar restaurant and pool area look good but the rooms need to be spruced up  I will not return there for sure  
N => wonderful experience We read the reviews on this site the night before our stay and almost ended up cancelling  Im glad we didnt as this was one of the nicest hotel stays for us  We traveled with  families  people in all  We were slightly nervous about what to expect but just until we got there  The check in was effortless our room was very nice  It faced the atrium but there certainly wasnt any musty smell  The rooms at least in this part of the hotel seem to have gone through a recent reno  The atrium is beautiful   real tropical plants birds fish tank games to play and places to just sit and enjoy  We ended up having dinner just after  oclock and were very pleasantly surprised when our waiter told us that they will keep the pool open longer just so that we could still have our swim  I love that the hotel has a life guard   we travel quite a bit and I have never seen one in any other hotel  The pool was lovely hot tub was not working but it was not missed  The next morning we enjoyed a lovely breakfast and then a swim in the outdoor pool   water temperature was amazing  The staff were all wonderful the place is clean and all in all this was a very enjoyable stop over  I was amazed at the room rates at this place  Would definitely stay there again should we end up in Montreal  
N => Dont stay here We were staying here due to a one night layover  Upon entering my room I was overwhelmed by a strong musty smell  There were duvets on the beds without duvet covers instead there was a sheet on top and one on the bottom of the duvet  Although a large shuttle was available to pick up the  some guests from the airport there were only  spots available on the morning shuttlesone came every half hour  After getting a busy signal when trying to make a local call I called the front desk to ask if there was a problem  I was informed that this was because they didnt have my credit card number and that local calls cost  cents per call  This was NOT mentioned upon check in  Overall a bad experience  I will never stay here again  
N => Great Overnighter In Montreal The Holiday Inn Montreal Airport with such negative reviews on TripAdvisor was a bit of a risk when choosing to stay there  We were happily surprised It was our first trip to Montreal and we werent at all familiar with the area  We were overnighting in Montreal en route to Las Vegas  Upon arriving at the Pierre Trudeau Airport it proved fairly easy to find the free shuttle they offer to their guests  It was quick easy and released some of the nerves from being in a new city Check in was prompt and efficient  The wonderful lady even helped us figure out how to take transit into downtown Montreal  She also set up a reservation for the complimentary shuttle the next morning as we had an early flight out of Montreal The room was wonderful and hospitable  All the furniture and fixtures appeared to be new  The only thing that required updating were the old and stained carpets  This property also has a really neat pool area tropical themed  We didnt have a chance to go for a swim but looked like plenty of funOverall it was a great overnighter in Montreal  This hotel met all of our needs and we found the complimentary shuttle to be a huge help  
N => Needs Updating We stayed at the Holiday Inn Airport for  nights and attended a family group function in the dining room of the Holiday Inn  Restaurant staff were amazing and very accomodating  Although we had requested to hold our event on their quotpatioquot the restaurant manager had indicated that it was unavailable as they had to get it ready for a later event  this actually didnt happen till much later after our group left therefore we could have had use of it Front desk is extremely slow   people behind desk but only one person can actually serve guests and he flies around trying to help everyone at the same time  took us about   minutes to check in rooms are really outdated  need new paint and upgrading in bathrooms  really thin walls to adjoining rooms and hallway  corridors smell quotsmokeyquot even though we were in no smoking area  windows need cleaninglow cost but low quality accomodations  roomshallways need to be cleaned painted and updated geat location if you need to do things in west end of Montreal  just off of highway which leads to downtown  close to malls and airport 
N => Seasoned Business Traveler says STAY AWAY First of all the front desk personnel were not friendly or helpful  The parking lot was not plowed due to heavy snow  Terrrible ordeal trying to park and back out My room heater was noisy and not working efficiently  The room was COLD  Was told that in the morning someone would take care of this  Cold air was seeping through all the heater fixtures This was my worst hotel stay ever and would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Why OH why didnt I listen In four words   do not stay here We arrived at AM and I phoned and was told the shuttle was finished for the night  Paid   for a cab  There are a lot of other hotels the Hampton the new Loft same price point and the Hilton   its more but probably worth it  I am not a hotel snob and know you get what you pay for but this hotel does not deliver in any sense  To the almost  minute wait to get checked in and to my amusement   other guests being given rooms twice with someone already sleeping in them then to be told  nowhere in the vicinity can I buy cigarettes   no the bar is closed it was a Sat night   no you cannot have shuttle for AM or AM or AM the next morning  Hence another   cab ride back  Got to the room   very very Motel  although that would be better but the bathroom was not cleaned probably  Really for  night   I at least expect the     to be cleaned from the toilet bowl I then ided I needed at least a can of coke  Two pop machines did not work   the one that did was out of coke  Thirty minutes later I ided I should be grateful for my can of Sprite The or is dated the staff disorganized and to add injury to insult the hotel is not even that close to the airportHeed my warnings   DO NOT STAY HERE   its a scum pitSlocker 
N => A dump The definition of a       Smells bad  dirty  very cheap look to it  bad service  My door key needed to be reprogrammed each time I used it   And the frontdesk people would each time look very surprised that it did not work properly as if I was to blame for that Do not confuse with the Holiday Inn Express which is down the road and appears to be a much better place  
N => Appalling customer service   AVOID I stayed at this hotel when my flight to London was delayed  From the start the staff were unfriendly  Check in took ages despite several staff members seemingly doing nothing behind the counter  The room itself was dingy musty and old fashioned  The bar staff were incredibly rude   literally just shrugging when we asked them anything My vegetarian pizza had ham over one corner of it which was the kind of sloppy attitude we experienced throughout the hotel  The receptionist was lazy and unhelpful  We overheard other guests complaining about their stay but again the staff just ignored them their attitude was that nothing was their problem Also   the hotel doesnt have a lift How bizarre for an airport hotel when most guests will have lots of luggage I would really recommend that you avoid this hotel  
N => avoid This hotel is bad for a holiday inn  Our problems started at check inn  We arrived in Montreal after a trip to california from the UK  Our flight to london meant we had a  hour stop in Montreal  We called the Hotel from the airport and they agreed they had a room for the day for  adults and agreed a price  After a long wait for the shuttle bus we arrived to be told we couldnt have the  room but they only had   There was no apology or concern she was very rude and abrupt  She blamed the mis information on her colleague who was checking in another group  She then suggested if we wanted to argue we could deal with him  I agreed and said i would like to speak to the person i made the agreement with over the phone  not argue as i pointed out  I spoke to George who aske for our credit card and proceeded to check us in to the room and rates we agreed on the phone  She then ided to interrupt and pointed out that her colleague was making a mistake and shouldnt be giving us the rooms whilst she was serving another guest  her manner from the start was rude and it appeared she had issues with her colleague who remained very proffessional throughout  After this we found the rooms very dated and the whole place was unpleaseant  Im not one to complain but this was atrocious for a Holiday Inn  I expected a whole lot more for the prices they chrge  I will also be making a formal complaint against the female member of staff  
N => Rooms smell horrible We stayed at this hotel through an airline voucher when our flight was cancelled  I know the hotel was busy at that time but the first room we were given had an overwhelmingly smoky and musky smell  The kind of smell that permeates everything and ferments over twenty years in the carpets drapes etc  We asked for a new room but the second one was just as bad smelling  On top of that the check in staff were rude the bathroom was dirty and all our clothing stunk badly when we got home  I would say this is barely a two star hotel  Definitely not recommended  
N => car stolen from parking lot This hotel has a definite safety issue   a car was stolen from the parking lot in ust   Right near airport so very noisy Unfourtunately this hotel is being keted to US youth sports teams as an ideal place to stay during a tournament    dont stay here  
N => Not that good I was stuck in Montreal for  night due to flight cancellations  I therefore needed to stay near the airport and was trying to find a room at pm  The Hilton and the Four Points Sheraton were both booked out but I thought Holiday Inn had a certain standard it had to live up to so I booked this for  including tax The free shuttle from the airport to the hotel was appreciated  The service at the front desk was excellent and very friendly  However the room was below average  There was hair in the sink and the toilet seat was not clean  TV reception wasnt clear  The rooms have  doors    to a corridor and the other to the indoor pool which meant a fairly noisy atmosphere  The rooms are tired and dated and in need of reation  Additionally the alarm clock was not set to the right time which I would expect   it was  hours off and therefore looked as if it was the right time  Luckily I had set the alarm on my cell phone as well or I would have missed my flight If stuck at Montreal again Ill find somewhere else to stay  
N => Bed bugs   Do not Stay  We only stayed there one night  We booked two rooms as we have a rather large family  One of the rooms must have had bed bugs or something because those who slept in that bedroom had bug bites all over their faces and necks  To be honest and fair   we didnt actually see any bugs The room with the bed bugs had a good shower  The other room the shower was damaged because the water dripped out slowly  So we all took showers in the room of with bed bugs  The hotel is being remodelled  In order to get to the main lobby we had to walk through a hall way with tools and materials placed along the wall  Local phone calls are not free  Location is horrible  It was far from all of the major attractions that we visited  I wouldnt recommend this to anyone  
N => Bad Hotel   no security I stayed at this hotel when my dhter had a softball tournament in Montreal  For starters it was not very safe you did not need your key to swipe the doors to get in at all  Most of the doors to get in the hotel were broke  This was a big problem considering cars were being stolen and broken into from the property all day and night long  I did not feel safe at all especially having  teams of teenage girls there  Hotel was not clean  The best part of this hotel is what they show on line the indoor pool area  Food was terrible in this hotel  Hotel was booked and they had two waiters on in the Restaurant took hrs for our food and it was cold and nasty  Will never stay here again or Monteal Canda  by the time our group left we were there  nights we had  stolen cars  laptop and  wallet stolen and  Car almost stolen theives were interrupted   This hotel and Montreal suck    
N => Nasty and below expectations We are long time Priority Club members but will not be staying at anymore Holiday Inns that we are not already familiar with  The quality is too inconsistent  The carpet was soiled from a spill  The box spring had a visible soiled place  One pillow had an offensive odor  We received poor directions to our second floor room from the desk clerk and had a difficult time finding our room as we traveled with our luggage upstairs and downstairs no elevator  
N => Great Place To Stay Despite some very bad reviews we took the chance rates were lower than anywhere else particularly when we prepaid our five night stayAll I can say it was a great stay rooms were comfortable and clean air conditioning in top shape plenty of towels and toiletries and room made up up promptly The pool was great and the help at the reception desk to get us in and out and over Cote de Liesse Road was excellent  They advised us on tours food was great and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming  Shuttle bus was quick friendly and efficient We will definitely stay there again when next we visit Montreal  
N => beware of park n fly  I booked that hotel so i could leave my pick up at the hotel parking because i didn t want to leave it at the airport  I was going away for  month  To my big surprise i thought that was weired that they did nt want to keep my pick up keys They didn t even want to have my license plate number  So when i got back from my wonderfull trip my truck was GONE  the hotel was no help at all and i will NEVER stay there again  The rooms are verry old and have a funny smell  The bar is open late so you can have a drink before leaving for your vacation out of Dorval airport  The cost of one beer is   plus tip so we only had   loLRemember if you want to leave your car there with the park n fly package go somewhere else where they will take your keys and license plate number  I had to book another flight to go home  
N => Absolutely Pathetic Dump Whatever you do DO NOT STAY HERE This review is long and detailed as I dont want anyone else to experience what we did  I will start off by saying that I am from Montreal but now reside in Ottawa  My girlfriend and I were flying south for a week from Montreal so our travel agent booked us here for one night  It seemed convenient with free parking for up to  days with one night stay this is too good to be true and I should have suspected something and an airport shuttle service  In my opinion this hotel is a fraud Firstly it is not an quotairportquot hotel  It is on Cote de Liesse near the arie expressway which is a long way from the airport  To be exact it is a  cab ride  I know this because their quotshuttle servicequot is a joke and we had to get a taxi  Where to begin   We checked in and the extremely rude receptionist demanded the confirmation number even though you would think a name would suffice  In any event I went out to the car and retrieved the number  I then asked for a  a m shuttle to the airport and was told that it was full and that the next available shuttle was at  am  As our flight was leaving at  this was a little too tight  The lady at the desk seemed very unconcerned and told me that since the weather was bad the next days flights were likely going to be delayed anyhow  Apparently during her breaks she moonlights as an air traffic controller  I asked how many spots they had on their quotshuttle and was told it is an outside service they use and only  spots are available and since this was a busy time of day for flights it was already full  Heres a clue   if its a typically busy time get more or bigger vehicles  Anyhow I wanted to stay somewhere else but it was getting late and we just wanted to chill out so I asked what the room rate was if we didnt leave our car there  My intention was to drive ourselves to a Park and Fly in the morning and use their shuttle  The rate I was quoted was higher than what I was already being charged  They know they have you so they scam you into having to stay there  But the best was yet to come   We went to our quotroomquot   I use this term loosely because it was a dump  Plain and simple a youth hostel would have been better  Old tired and dank  I called the front desk and asked for a wake up call at  am  quotNo problemquot  I also asked that a cab be called to attend the hotel at  and pick us up  Again quotNo problemquot  Not trusting them I set the alarm in the room which had a battery backup in case of power failure but no battery in it as well as my watch  No wakeup call ever came and no cab was called we called one ourselves  Everything from the sheets to the towels to the carpets and furnishings is unclean worn out or both  At checkout I complained to the typically inept clerk about the service and asked to see the manager whose name was posted on the wall as quoton duty  Turns out he doesnt come in until noon so I let the counter staff feel my frustration  As with the shuttle service and the wake up call he didnt work well either So to sumize this is not an airport hotel  You are better off staying anywhere else  There are certain features an airport hotel should have like a shuttle a wake up call and relative proximity to the airport  This place has none of the above  You almost need a connecting flight to get from here to the airport It is not a Holiday Inn but instead an independently run franchise operated by quotHotels Cote de Liessequot or something like that  Holiday Inn goes to great lengths to advertise this fact as they know something we dont yet  If there was a quotzero starquot rating possible I would give it to this joke of a building I refuse to refer to it as a hotel  They have a clean and professional looking lobby with a  star rating on the wall that has to be fraud right there but this is just the hook to get you to commit  I violated my own rule and failed to ask to see the room first and I should have checked TripAdvisor beforehand  The name quotHoliday Innquot fooled me but never again  Therefore if you do stay here you do so at your own peril  Sleeping on an airport bench would be a preferable option  
N => What a dump First impression was good nice lobby attractive pool area  The room was very small and dingy  There was no fridge or microwave in the room as advertised on the website  We were informed that we were supposed to request those ahead of time  We asked for another room  We waited over an hour for them to clean a room  When we moved the room was extremely small the bathroom was the size of a closet  The room was dirty had wobbly furniture and ripped carpet  When we turned on the microwave most of the power in the room went out  It took  hours to fix  Staff seemed disorganized told us the indoor pool was closed and we should go to the outdoor pool  We walked around to that pool and it was closed and padlocked  We packed and wanted to leave but unfortunately had prepaid and we could not get a refund  Overall a terrible experience  
N => Stay away I stayed at the Holiday Inn Aeroport Montreal for one night This hotel is on a  lane freeway  Full of mold Strong Perfume Smell Springy Bed Cant reach the front desk after several minutes on hold  In person the lineup is long  Theres a light switch in the shower which is a huge electricution hazard Tub feels like its going to fall through the floor at any moment Garbage and matresses stored throughout the outside courtyard to make it almost unuseable Indoor Area smelled too much like mold to even walk through   i prefered to use the back door near my hotel room to get around to the front even in thunder showers because the inside was too horrible I could hear alarm buzzers at  and  in the morning from other rooms Everything was sticky in my room It smelled like puke and feces No comment cards No easy way to reach hotel managment When calling InterContinental Relations hold time over  minutes and they were only able to forward my comments to the hotel  They werent willing to take ANY responsibility themselves even if the hotel carries their brand name I spent almost  at various holiday inns this week and this one spoiled my whole vacation on the last day  Left a very sour taste in my mouth Comfort Inn Choice Hotels has been much better to me    I will continue to stay there as at least they seem to have some quality control  
N => With so many choices choose something else  I wouldnt receommend this hotel unless you like tacky or poor customer service and rooms that scream BLAH My business colleague had stayed at this hotel before and he had pretty good things to say about it  While he seemed to enjoy the place more than I he will also not return to this hotel First I found the service to be poor  Being there on business we needed access to a fax machine  We were ensured that we would have access to one and they have a business centre  The business centre consists of a printerfaxcopy machine that doesnt fax and a computer with internet access  I was told to fax on this machine by the man at the front desk only to find out it wasnt a fax machine when I asked for help from a lady at the front desk the man had gone home  This same woman offered to fax my report for me but when I handed her the  pages I needed faxed she said she couldnt do it for  hours  I had to ask for everything including alternatives and directions to the Bureau Gros Staples She was not helpful at all and she was very rude The rooms were in poor condition  My colleague had a shower head that didnt work and when I turned the taps on the water was brown  The high speed internet Wireless barely worked  When I asked the front desk they advised me to purchase a Cat  cable and plug it in for a better connection  Since I had to go to Bureau Gros anyways I picked one up  When I returned to my room after a day of work the cable didnt fit as it was for a phone cable  The staff were again unapologetic The food at the hotel is not worth what you pay  The buffets breakfast and dinner were poor quality and everything seemed overpriced  The indoor poor under the atrium and the surrounding area will bring you back to the s when that hotel had style  Now it needs to be reated by a wrecking ball Around Montreals airports there are many choices that are much better in terms of value and almost all are better in terms of quality  Do not be fooled and avoid this hotel for whatever purpose you have in Montreal  
N => Very Disappointed We stayed at this hotel for two  nights in ust  because it is close to the airport and  minutes from the relatives that we were visiting  When we arrived there was no bellboy available to help and we had to drag the luggage up as there are no elevators in the hotel  The room was not clean not well lighted as bulbs were completely missing in some of the lamps  When I went by the window to look out I stood into a soaked carpet  This room needs to be reated  The hallway had a bad odor and you coud hear noise coming from the next room  The next day we went out although the housekeeping people were on the floor we came back to a dirty room  Since the phones were out of service I had to walk to the reception to inquire as to why the room was not cleaned  Half an hour later there was a knock at the door and housekeeping brought in towels cleaned the bathroom but did not make the beds  This type of service is expected in a motel  As a Priority Club Member I expected more from this hotel  Therefore the price is not reasonable due to the lack of service  For all this inconvenience I thought that the rate would have been reduced  The only good thing was the free parking as there is a fee in some hotels  What a disappointmentRoom  
N => Worst Hotel Ever I stayed in this hotel with my wife and son in y of  to attend a wedding next door at the  Points which was sold out  It was a huge mistake  The staff is so rude and inconsiderate and the shower head didi not work at all On top of that the refused to fix it  For  nights we used a cup to pour water on ourselves to bathe  I will never stay at another Holiday Inn again  
N => Never again  We just returned from one night at this Holiday Inn which was one too many  The hotel seemed full of families so obviously they are getting customers but the fact that it has a FOUR star rating on its door is shocking to me  our room smelled bad was dingy and dirty cobwebs on the ceiling and curtains water stains everywhere shower curtain falling apart etc etc We had a view of the pool   which was also disgusting  The pool was  full of green slime and there was trash everywhere  The gym is dirty overheated and located in a spot where people wet from the pool run in and out constantly not fun   plus my husband and dhter went out for dinner at the hotel restaurant and paid almost  for  meals and a sandwich and coke for me oh yes and they accept dogs too so our neighbor had one that barked on and off all night  The capper was when we told them explicitly we needed to catch an early shuttle for our flight to which they said fine   it leaves at  am  We arrived a few minutes to   to find the shuttle gone and the front desk told us quotoh it already left and you were supposed to be here at five minutes to quot  which they DID NOT tell my husband when he spoke to them the night before  Then the manager suggests we just wait around until the next shuttle   hour later which would mean a possible missing of our flight We were both furious esp  as we had to take an expensive taxi to the airport and the shuttle was one of the main reasons we even stayed at this hotelDo NOT stay here if you have any other choice  its a dump overpriced the service is inept and clearly Holiday Inn has washed their hands of this placegt 
N => disgusting This was possibly the worst hotel ever  After checking in we discovered that the toilet in the small dark and run down room we checked into didnt work  We called the front desk and they promised to move us to another room  The desk clerk arrived at our room with keys to a room in the back of the hotel with a view of the parking lotwe asked if we could remain in a room with a view of the poolto this the clerk became very rude and told my husband she had already told him it was not facing the pool  my husband is not stupid and was not told the room was at the back of the hotel but he apologized and asked if we could stay in a room facing the pool   minutes later no new room husband called the front desk again as room we were to move to was next door and had been clean since we arrived  This time the manager came to our room and she is agressively rude as she is standing in the doorway yelling at my husband I write down her name  attitude change when she sees me do this  The next room is no better wallpaper peeling off walls hair in the bathroom I counted  bandaides around the pool  ponytail holders and a hair clip which were all there the next day  Will never stay at a holiday inn again 
N => Avoid if possible We stayed one night at this hotel in ruary   Its fairly close to the airport and offers reasonable prices  free parking  However we would not return to this hotel The room looked well past its prime and was simply not clean  Most pieces of furniture were scratched a lightbulb in one of the lamps was completely missing and we found a silverfish in the bathroom  Roomservice delivered pancakes instead of the French Toast we had ordered  Very disappoiting  
N => This hotel is mediocre   would have prefered to stay elsewhere I just stayed at the Holiday Inn Montreal Midtown and I wasnt at all impressed  I booked through Hotwire and our rate was good but Hotwire classifies this hotel as   stars   and it doesnt meet that expectation in my opinion  Hotwire doesnt tell you where you are staying until youve booked   and when I found out I was staying at the Holiday Inn I wasnt sure what to expect   but considering they rated this hotel as a   star property I figured it would be more than adequate for service and amenities  The lobby was nice and the room was large and ent enough but the noise filtering through from the hallway was the worst Ive experienced in a hotel  You could hear the guests in the room below us every time they flushed their toilet  In room amenities consisted of one tiny bar of soap and a tiny bottle of shampoo  There wasnt even a hotel directory in the room  There was hair in our sheets and my spouse cut his finger on a small piece of glass embedded in the bed cover  The parking situation was terrible  Being Halloween we didnt want to park our vehicle on the street so we used the hotels parking facilities  Valet parking is mandatory at this hotel which we werent happy about considering the risk of damages and us not having easy access to our vehicle  In the evening we had dinner reservations outside the hotel and waited  minutes for valet to bring us our truck as the attendant was too busy parking cars for a wedding party that had arrived   it appeared we were at the bottom of the priority list  And we had tipped them well beforehand The doorman wouldnt call down to find out what was causing the delay   he simply passed the phone over to us and had us call down to valet to inquire  Needless to say we were late for our reservation and were rather frustrated  In the morning the express check out service was not working so I had to stand in line at the front desk for what seemed like forever   since there was only one staff member working on a Sunday morning  Ive stayed at the Delta Montreal next door a number of times and found it to be a much better hotel all around for the same price  I wouldnt go back to the Holiday Inn Midtown if I could avoid it   I suspect this hotel is being managed by bean counters trying to cut costs in every possible way  
N => Great Hotel I usually stay at theHilton Garden Inn in Montreal but i saw the hotel last time i stayed in Montreal my wife and I ided to try to something new since the Hitlon is over price and the service is crappy    The Holiday Inn Midtown was such a delite from the way the staff is so polite and friendly    They upgraded me to their excutive levels we had a beautifull view of the city      The swimming Pool is so huge for a hotel pool we where in shock This is not your typical Holiday Inn  I am inquiring on how i would be able to change my points from Hitlon Honors To this Priority card system that they are talking about     I even saw staff from other Hotels with their name badge coming to their restaurent to eat   I cant wait to come back for New Years       
N => Convienent but unhelpful and no service After reading some of the reviews of the other guests I was a little skeptical  I was expecting an old and dirty hotel    Thankfully that wasnt so we drove into Montreal from Burlington VT  Took about a  minute drive     but we got to Montreal and hotel around  AM  They had a room available at that time  They checked us into Room   Right next to the elevator  We were worried that it would be too noisy but it was fine  The showers were a little old  There were cracks in the wall and some mold on the grout but if you werent looking you would be fine  We checked for bed bugs     Thankfully the beds were clean  As were the towels and linens  I felt comfortable sleeping  The location of this hotel is great  Within a block or two of the McGill Metro stop  Four blocks up from the Place des Arts and within walking distance of old montreal and Mont Royal  The only complaint that I had was the front desk staff  They were un friendly and not really helpful  You would be standing in front of the receptionist with no one else around but you and it took her several minutes to acknowledge you  Most of the staff did not smile  There was never a concierge on site but if you were to go to the receptionist for a recommendation for a dinner restaurant all they could do was refer to the concierge but the concierge would never show up  Upon check out we valeted our car    our ticket was in our suitcase so we needed to put our suitcase on the ground to dig for it only to have the valet service say rudely   go to P     If you dont like people    be you really shouldnt be in the industry Id recommend staying here only be prepared for no service  
N => Nighte in Room  OK some nice things  Great Downtown location on Sherbrooke West  Crisp clean towels and bedsheets  BUT   all else was horrorOur travel agent booked us two nights at the HIMM as part of a two week tour itinerary of eastern Canada  After a week travelling independently in the rural wilds of east Quebec staying in low budget motels we were excited about our final two nights in a big name hotel  How wrong we were  This is a fur coat no knickers hotel if ever there was one hi gloss lobby shocking rooms We were allocated Room   Among its many delights were crumbs from previous occupants on table sticky spots on the floor tiles grubby carpet low power shower that swerved from scalding to icy long black hairs in the bath nasty unidentified stains on the wall next to the toilet a toilet that required you to lean your full body weight on the lever to flush chipped washbasin dirt encrusted hairdryer stained carpet chipped veneer on the furniture curtains broken free from their track that not only didnt close properly but had large horizontal tears to get a full nights sleep we had to secure the gaps with the tent pegs   lucky we packed them no I could go on and on and on but you get the picture    Sadly the horror doesnt end there  No sirree  As we checked in a gang of school children burst screaming and yelling through the lobby  I turned to the receptionist and said   jokingly   we arent on the same corridor are we No of course not said the receptionist without blinking  Guess what        First thing we knew about it was returning from dinner emerging from the lift to be confronted with two security guards  Our corridor was full of screaming boys their teachers trying to herd them into rooms  I went straight downstairs and asked reception very politely if they could move us immediately  Receptionist   sneery   said that the hotel was very full and that there were only five unoccupied rooms  I smiled and said that any one of those five rooms that wasnt on a floor with the school party would do us just fine  Receptionist   glacial   said we could take that up with the hotel manager in the morning  Oh what fun we had It took the teachers from   to round up the little darlings secure them in their rooms and do a door by door final check  And then the routine started up next morning from   this time accompanied by running down the corridors yelling and banging on doors  My partner bribed me with promise of a blow out final dinner not to waste our last full day in Canada faffing around changing hotel rooms assuming that the manager would have oh so generously allowed it  Instead we made a point of staying away from the hotel for as much of the day as possible and not spending a cent on any of its additional facilities I travel on business in the Middle East and some of my favourite properties are Holiday Inns  No Holiday Inn in that developing region would offer such shabby facilities or be so dismissive of a guests complaints  I used to be a huge fan of the Holiday Inn brand  Not any more  AVOID HOLIDAY INN MONTREAL MIDTOWN LIKE THE PLAGUE  
N => Dirty and Noisy I have an open mind and tried this hotel despite the many bad reviews  The location is excellent for shopping and for young adults wanting to be close to the night scene  We did find used soap left in our shower  We did have hair and stains on the bed linens  We did have the noisiest neighbours  We asked several times for someone to check out the cleanliest of our room no one came  We did ask security to ask our neighbours to quiet down  once at midnight and then again at  am  Which they did but you could hear the room guests just lh security off  They valet people were rude and was the bell man  I dont know if I would stay here again be it was just bad luck on the day of our stay  
N => Awful Experience ided to try hotwire for the first time Big mistake When we arrived at the Hotel the parking garage was full which meant that the hotel itself was also jam packed      the wait at the desk took forever to check in and when we finally got the car parked and into our room we were very disappointed The room was shabby  chairs broken the bathroom  a toilet and Tub were tiny and far from sound proof Not enough towels which we requested more of but never gotThe room had a door ajoining the room next door through wich we could hear the unending partying going on by the   people inside we did ask for security to come up but it took  phone calls and did little   after getting no sleep  nights in a row we were awakened by the maid who failed to knock before entering and by a construction guy on the roof right outside our windowHonestly if the window opened I could have offered the guy a cup of coffee he was literally right outside our windowWe will return to Montreal but never to this Holiday Inn 
N => Nice location The location was great  We were able to walk to alot of restaurants  We were there for the Montreal Jazz Festival and were able to walk there nightly  We drove from Chicago to the Festival but never used our car for anything  We found the hotel staff to be pleasant when we did talk with them or ask a question  We did not eat in the restaurant since there are alot of places to eat in the surrounding area  The rooms were spacious enough for us since there  of us in the room  
N => Do NOT stay here Dirty and noisy Upon arrival only the linen seemed clean  There were hairs old bar soap and paper stuck to the bathroom floor  Carpet in room was OBVIOUSLY not vaccuumed  We could write our names in the dust top of television  Their excuse   the cleaning lady had only worked there for  days   and that should be MY problemTemperature was  C in room  We had to place a maintenance call for ac as well as for someone to come clean the room  My friends also booked a room on the same floor   no ac and the carpet were not cleaned  Our room was very small  beds  We awoke several times throughout the night as we could hear the quotneighboursquot urinate in THEIR room   need I mention how noisy their showers and toilets were The walls are paper thin no doubt  We were assured that this hotel had undergone major renos   I cannot imagine the condition of this place prior to the renos I say FIRE the contractors We will NEVER stay at this hotel EVER again   ever 
N => Do not stay at this hotel We booked this hotel online  The room was dirty upon our arrival pm   night we were so tiered that we ided to sleep and not to complain  After the cleaning lady had cleaned our room we noticed that she had dropped few of our items under the bed We were lucky that we dropped something ourselves that day and had to look for it there otherwise we would have left the items dropped by the cleaning lady there While we were grapping our stuff we also found a camera that belonged to a guest previously staying in our room  We returned the camera to the receptionOn our departure day we realized that we were missing our Bluetooth after we checked out so we went back to the hotel room to look for it and sure enough it was hiding under our bed againAnd to top things up when we got back to Toronto we noticed that apparently the valet staff had ided to take an un opened drink from our carI would recommend staying away from this hotel  I ve never had things stolen from me in all the hotels I ve been to  
N => Just if you have no other options My stay in Holiday Inn Montreal was for  days but I could experience some good stuff and some bad too  Starting with the rooms they seemed to be very simple confortable beds at least when I was there TV    but about the bathroom it was so small that you have to be skilled to put on your clothes    claustrophobic for most people   About the lobby no big hassle to check in and theres a small shop where you can buy some last minute gift from Montreal if you are in a hurry The soda machines were broken and there was not any warning about that therefore I had lost some coins but the staff gave me them back Just stay there if you just want a  to  days stay and need somewhere to rest for a cheaper price  If you are coming with your family in vacations I would not recommend it  
N => Very s style I stayed on the th floor and elevator will take you there only when you swipe your room card and you need to swipe it dozen times  Needless to say it was very annoying  Hotel is going through reation but cleaning staff needs to do more cleaning  I was first put in the room on th floor but it was obvious that it wasnt vacuumed and I saw hair in the bathroom right next to the sink  I asked for a different room and was given room on the th floor which was much better  The only plus is front desk who was more than pleasant and very professional  Very s style hotel but my stay was ok since I was there only to sleep  Hopefully it will get better with reations  
N => Pretty Grosse ok the bed matresses had stains  they were pretty uncomfortable  the showers had hair in them  so after we complained they were cleaned a bit but yet still dirty  one of my friends found a tampon in the room  so i find that disgusting the only good thing i found was that there was space but i had a lot of problems 
N => Concerned About This Hotel This used to be a fine hotel for a reasonable cost  However it is beginning to show its age  Durning my last stay in a corporate floor room the carpets in the halls were worn and patched  The room was satisfactory however the thermostat did not work the tub had mildew around it the tub drain did not drain properly leaving showering persons standing ankle deep in water during their showers the double lock did not work and the bed was lumpy  As far as facilities the pool area was dark and poorly lit the whirlpool was inoperable the k chairs all broken Swimming in the pool was not pleasant  Their gym apparatus was fine and they do offer massages  I would recommend not staying here until their reations are completed  
N => poor poor hotel in my room i had a leaking shower and the service was poor dont give workers tips  montreal is not a nice city if you want to go to a hotel in montreal go to the hayat regency it is in a shopping mall  
N => Good Deal for the Price Stayed here for  nights  MY room executive level was very small but you expect ta in a downtown setting where space is expensive  The floor to ceiling mirror was broken they taped cardboard with duct tape around it  I had a problem wit the toilet and the maintenance man was here in  mins to fix it  The valet parking is sub par most days you have to wait awhile as they only seem to have  person working  However the service is impeccable Very friendly staff super quick to respond to ANY problem  Convienient location to shopping and food  All in all it is a great deal if you want to save money  It is by far less expensive to the courtyardnext door  They have all the services you will need money exchange info desk taxi gift shop barrestaurant etc  The ATM does not take the plus network cards but there is a Bank of Montreal ATM  block away  Not elegant for a luxury vacation but great for the business traveller  
N => Neutral Average Positives           Service at front desk was goodLocation is excellent  walking distance to St Catherines and about  cab to Old montreal On site restaurant was acceptable and breakfast prices were very ent  I hatedriving around looking for breakfast  Negatives            Room were a little older  ie noise was not well insulatedNo fan in bathroom  minor but can be a painOverall   average  compared to other holidays InnsMisc       There is a limit of  people at a time in pool  so you might expect some delays swimming   parking fee  extra 
N => Should Not Be Called A Holiday Inn Take it from someone who knows     this hotel is horrible  I am a manager at another Holiday Inn and am embarassed for the Holiday Inn Midtown Montreal  The check in process took  minutes the concierge was rude  The rooms are small and not very clean  The Air Conditioning stinks  There is a small ven under the window and on hot days it does not cool the small room  Dont even think of closing the drapes because the air conditioning will just blow into the drapes and make them cold The restaurant does not follow any standards of Holiday Inn  No coffee pots for the tables no to go coffee cups etc On a whole this has to be the worst Holiday Inn I have ever seen  
N => Just average Stayed on the executive floor  To be sure there was nothing special about my room to justify the price difference  Or was it the  cent newspaper I got in the morning Oh yes there was a quotloungequot    which was in fact a converted bedroom with couches and a TV   not sure I got the point  Check in was slow too many people and not enough staff but this can happen anywhere  Breakfast was very disappointing go eat somewhere else The bed was in bad shape sagging mattress way too soft Ive stayed at worse Holiday Inns and at better ones  
N => Okay but theres got to be better places to stay I came in with a tour so we didnt have to go through the desk the subject of some reviews  What I did notice was that the hotel was absolutely SWAMPED with other tours mobs and mobs of people strolling here and there  The room was okay    standard mid range hotel fare    but it was COLD  Many others in my tour complained that it took all night for their rooms to warm  Luckily there was an unused bed in mine whose quilt could be used  Breakfast was via menu    no buffet that I saw    and watch those mobs My waitress really ran hard kudoes to her and delivered a fairly good US type breakfast nothing to write home about  When I returned to Montreal a few days later I stayed a couple blocks down at the Casa Bella and played with the idea of cancelling there and returning to the Holiday Inn  Which tells you somethng about the Casa Bella  Montreals a big city theres got to be a better mid priced hotel somewhere 
N => Not worth the money Definitely not worth the money  Room was small  No vent in bathroom  Shades would not shut completely so room was bright at night from outside lights and in the early morning from the sun  AC was not working at   so room was warm  Could hear family next door in the morning thru the adjoining door  Very uncomfortable stay  Did not check the pool out so cannot comment about that  Room was clean though  Long lines at the check incheck out counter throughout our stay  Door service was great  Valet service was slow so better off parking on your own  Would not stay here again and would rather try my chances somewhere else  
N => Not the best place to stay   keep looking We have just got back from our third trip to Montreal   this was our first stay at the Holiday Inn Midtown and our last  We experienced problems right from the check in time of which they would not honor the price that they quoted and emailed confirmation of  when we got there    we ended up paying an extra night on an  day stay  We had emailed them  weeks prior to ask for non feather pillows and a fridge for our room    that didnt happen  I had to ask housekeeping to change the pillows and for extra pillows as we had requested prior and we were told just to empty the bar fridge in the room and use that  We stayed on the executive floor    not much different then the others definitely not worth the extra money paid  The free internet was down most of our weeklong stay  Their continental breakfast in our quotloungequot was stale croissants and muffins  The free coffee was dirty laundry water  They rented rooms on the floor to graduating high school kids that kept us up until  am and we finally had to call hotel security because of the noise and disruption There were  good things I can say      the conceirge service was impeccable helpful and always friendly  The food in the restaurant was great and excellent prices  The pool and hot tub were good Honestly use this hotel as a last resort    but search around first  We will not stay here again    very disappointing  
N => Extremely Accommodating Our impromptu visit to Montreal wound up being a  day  night excursion into a great and interesting city all due to the Holiday Inns front desk staffs efforts  The staff and management accommodated our situationour dhter was feeling too ill to travel back to NYC hence our need to stay a bit longer then planned and were very understanding  We definately reccommend this hotel and will stay here again 
N => Horrible Stay away Terrible hotel not up to Holiday Inn standards  Plan on lining for an hour to check in and check out  There is only ever one person at the counter even at pm check out time  The carpets are disgusting and covered in stains  This hotel hasnt been reated since the s  The room smelled like a combination of cigarette smoke and body odour  The sink was so cracked and stained it looked like someone had thrown up in it  It was so disgusting I had to turn my back to it to brush my teeth To top it all off I opened up the ice bucket and found it had a foul smelling orange slime in it  How can this be acceptable We just got back a couple of days ago and now my friend thinks he got a rash from the sheets  I have red spots all over my body that look like some sort of bites PS  Beware of the bar downstairs called ACEs  After dark it seems to be inhabited by what I can only describe as quotladies of the night quot 
N => Not too bad Just returned from a Memorial Day  Weekend at the Holiday Inn  The hotel and the room looked their age  But the room was clean and the sheets did not give us a rash The room lacked a refrigerator and a microwave  The bathroom was quite small but our bed was comfortable  It was a bit chilly in Montreal but the room was warm  The staff was helpful and there are places nearby to eat Check out CORAS for breakfast ask for directions  Not too far from the underground train system METRO  Overall not a bad palce to stay  
N => A must stay I have stayed at this Holiday Inn on  different occasions and have found it to be very comfortable quiet and clean I have recently read other on line reviews of the Inn but I can not find anything negative to say  I plan to stay here again in ch  as well  The Aces restaurant is a must do   a great breakfast 
N => Bed linens gave my mom a rash     I stayed there with my family in ember  after a supposed quotreation quot Its a great location close to Metro stations that huge underground mall etc  We stayed on a non smoking floor  However the entire place was dated and FILTHY  Hallways were dark and dingy  There was a huge stain on the carpet in the hallway  The bathroom grout was deteriorated and discolored  The little hair drier mounted to the wall was cracked  These are all little touches but seem so easy to fix  There is practically no noise insulation between adjoining rooms  We had to call the front desk to complain about a quotpartyquot next door  Worst of all my mom got some kind of itchy rash from the bed linens  I was so embarassed I made this reservation for my family  I would definitely NOT recommend this place  
N => Dont believe all you read We have just returned from a  night stay at the Holiday Inn Midtown  After I booked it I read some reviews that had me worried about how our accommodations would be  There was no need for the worry    We found the hotel to be very clean the rooms were a good size and the staff was friendly and helpful  
N => Not awful at all  
N => Not a good hotel  
N => Party de No l au Holiday Inn  
N => Montreal nothing special H I Express nice  Good location good service good servise good breakfast good deal This hotel is located in China Town and close to Old Montreal  I would definitely stay there again if I ever have to go to Montreal  
N => Never  Again  My family and I stayed at this property for two nights over ch Break  Pluses The rooms and public areas were outdated but clean enough  Great location in Chinatown right next to the old city next to a subway station ent breakfast buffet if you have it included in our room rate as we did  Thats about as much good as I can say about this place Minuses Where do I start We ordered a PPV movie for the kids one evening and the picture quality was terrible and totally unwatchable  Notified the front desk and we were assured they would reverse the charge  At checkout the charge was still there  Very defensive front clerk amended the bill and removed the charges but GET THIS they added the charge to my Amex two days later I am still trying to resolve this through central guest relations Other minuses   there was black scunge on the bubbles when the whirlpool was activated  total public health violation  Did not receive our breakfast vouchers at check in though they did correct this and after we checked out and tried to exit the parking garage the machine at the exit would not read our tickets resulting in over  cars being trapped and backed up underground  Pressing the help button did nothing it was only when the angry driver in front of me ched up to the front desk did they release the arm I will never EVER stay at this property again and possibly not another in the entire chain depending on how they resolve my issue with the billing of the movies  Wish Id listened to the negative reviews before hand  buyer definitely beware 
N => Nothing special I booked this hotel using hotwire and paid USDnight  It was definitely light on the pocketbook but I wish I had paid double in order to stay at a nicer hotel  The rooms themselves are not horrible  Just not as nice as I would have liked  They are dated but do have a nice big bathroom Location   its in a no mans land   in between old montreal and st  catherine street  Would have been better to be within one of those areas as opposed to between them  It is near the chinatown but its a pretty small chinatown  Pool area   gross and really dated  There is a ladder to go into the hot tub which does not seem safe at all  
N => Excellent trip  Was in Montreal for business picked the Holiday Inn Select because it was right across the street from the Convention Center  It was my first time in Montreal and I also wanted to make sure that I was close to shopping I wanted to do some site seeing and I love to dine and experience new food  What a surprise I found everything close to this Hotel  Located in Chinatown  min walk to the Old Montreal Port and close to the underground shopping The staff was the friendliest I have ever encountered  Pierre gave me great places to eat and told me where to go shop  The restaurant staff where always happy to see you in the morning and the breakfast was amazing  What a selection of food  I also wanted to experience their Chinese cuisine and had Dim Sum for lunch one day  The best I have ever eated If I go back to Montreal I would go back  
N => Delighted We were apprehensive after reading some negative reviews on TripAdvisor but in the end we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  We were also nervous since our French isnt good but all the staff we encountered addressed us in fluent English We found the hotel to be luxurious clean and comfortable  We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an ENORMOUS suite which was bigger than our appartment at home with a huge bed TWO bathrooms vast living area including space to work with a large desk tea and coffee making facilities   The hotel has a great location in the vibrant Chinatown disctrict and the glamorous styling and or reflects that being designed to Feng Shui principles Theres free wifi in the rooms and the day underground parking is convenient if be not designed for SUVs The breakfast buffet was very good Wed have no hesitation recommending the hotel and staying here again ourselves  
N => Not Bad for Night Discounted    Not a bad place really  We used an Entertainment discount and was charged  CADnight and this was over a  day weekend Black and Blue Ball  Typically it would have been   more per nightNotes Getting there from the airport If youre not familiar with the transit system we werent the shuttle bus from the airport  CAD one waycomes close to the hotel if you pack light you can walk from a close stop but the final bus stop on the airport shuttle still requires another free shuttle to take you to the Holiday Inn Centreville  I wasnt quite expecting that   but it was relatively efficient because we arrived at the beginning of rush hour  But dont expect that free shuttle off hours  We ended up taking a cab  CAD to the bus station  and again the airport shuttle on the return to the airport Room was large  Its a nice big hotel on a corner lot  I asked for a view and got an exterior th floor nice view facing west and looking downtown  Courtyard view might be quiet but it would be boring  Nice large modern TV not typical for budget hotels in Canada   comfortable queen beds   deskstablesspaces to workeat  Large bathroom counterspace could easily handle two people primping at the same time  Nice Free Wireless connection was a big line item for us  We both have laptops and use them  Wireless was non functional when we arrived and I was perturbed  Front desk had no idea that the whole hotel was down  I had to call technical help myself and almost had to threaten to leave if I couldnt access highspeed Internet  Hotel sincerely apologized and told me the situation would be fixed in  minutes  It was They get extra points for that Hotel is right on the Metro stop   stops to the Berri station  Convenient  Travel time to Le Village was less than  minutes using the subway  Not bad  Purchase a one day subway pass  CAD Only Negative FoodRestaurants You have to like Chinese food as that is the only cuisine that is within a quick walk  After pm good luck finding quick restaurants that are open in that neighborhood  If youre ready for a real good sit down meal Chinatown offers tons of choices  But if you want something on the level of a quick munchie good luck  Hotel Room service food was good fast reasonably overpriced and hearty  Old Montreal is a  minute walk and has a lot of good touristy restaurants I did not try the pool or the weight room  Ground floor lobby services seemed tranquil and bit subdued  But thats not a complaint Staff was professional friendly and helpful  Housekeeping was extremely patient in letting us vacate our room so they could clean  They gave us plenty opportunities to vacate when convenient for us  Nice I would stay there again for  CADnight as I saw nothing comparable to the Holiday Inn in terms of cost size and location  
N => Not a pleasant experience We had booked this hotel several months in advance and specifically requested a room facing the back yard  This request was lined and we instead got a room facing  very busy streets  The noise was unbearable It seems that the windows are not sound proof at all  To make things worse early in the morning there was another extremely loud noise from the top of the room we were on th floor  Whether it was the plumbing or anything else we do not know  When we mentioned it to the receptionist at check out she just shrugged her shoulders  Aircon was also very loud so we could not leave it on at night and Montreal had some very hot days in the beginning of oberThe room itself was nicely orated and perfectly OK  The breakfast buffet was very good as far as the quality of the food was concerned  What we did not like was the atmosphere  The pond with the fish is nice but we found it very strange that a young lady with short pants and rubber boots started cleaning the pond while we and some others were still having breakfast and sitting next to the pond  Officially breakfast time lasted till  but we had the impression that the staff wanted to get rid of us as quickly as possible we were there at around    Worst of all was the coffee  Nowhere in Canada were we offered such thin coffee  So after two days we were fed up with this gargling water and went to Tim Hortons in the nearby conference center where we got good and strong coffee  
N => Do not waste your time We spent a long weekend in this hotel and all I can say is quot do not bother wasting your time staying here quot The hotel pool was dirty and the jauzzi was even dirtier  The carpets in our room stunk and you could see where they had made an attempt to clean it up  We ided that since the location was good we would stay but as each day passed we regretted our ision The last straw was the   bottle of water that was billed to our credit card  I asked for a different room but as that was said that all the rooms were similar  yuk 
N => Mixed feelings The location of the hotel is convenient if one attends a conference at the international conference centre just across the street or if one wants to have Chinatown at walking distance  Waterfront area is by foot not more than  minutes  Reception staff very friendly no nonsense down to earth  Breakfast dinner facilities quiet good good choice interesting setting water ponds with plants and bridges  Barfood service in the evening a bit slow  Rooms no in room safe box one has to bring all valuables to reception getting it back is time consuming and not possible early morning only one staff seems to have the key to the safe  Free internet connection in the room  The hotel brochure boosts about the Feng Shui principles applied in its reconstruction meant to bring harmony and balance  I must say that I did not feel any of it on the contrary overall the hotel was quiet dark and not   maintained dead plants do not bring lots of chi  Fitness room and swimming pool dark and small  Overall my impression was fair but I assume there are better places in Montreal  
N => Not as bad as I feared Due to previous reviews I was not looking forward to staying at the Holiday Inn Select but I had no option as it was part of a Grand Prix deal  I was relieved to find it better than I expected in many respects but it does have some issues which  put off some travellers from staying The good points were   both our rooms   one on the th floor the other on the th Executive floor were very large very clean and the or and fixtures and fittings in good repair if a little dated in style with some small areas of wear and tear evident on the furniture  The executive room seemed a bit dark and more enclosed simply due to the choice of furniture colour  The beds were very comfortable  An iron and board were in the room as was a coffee maker  The water was always piping hot for a bath and all the staff we met were very friendly cheerful and helpful The bar snacks were excellent value for money good sized portions and tasty to eat  Breakfast ranged from  to  dollars Canadian and was taken in the very pleasant dining area by the water feature in the foyer area The not so good points   the pillows seemed very cheap lumpy foam filled ones so were very uncomfortable  The towels were thin and not large   the bath towel was not the normal hotel sized towel you expect by any means Some were newish others were so grey and worn I refused to touch them let alone use themThe veneer to the bathroom and room doors was in a poor state and spoilt the effect of the room  The bottom of the main door and it was the same all along the corridor appeared to have been hacked off as it was so uneven chipped and the gap between the carpet and door was about  inchesThe air con unit was floor standing and not overly efficient   it had several settings which was good and was not too noisy but it could have been better The hotels location was both excellent and not so good The excellent bit was everything so was easy to walk to from it  China town just around the corner   with dancing lions ladies well the lot a street ket and people playing jhong outside the Cathedral a couple of hundred yards away the waters edge  mile at most and shops and cafes very close as well  It was also easy to walk to the main underground shopping malls  A tubesubway station was close by The downside to the location was the hotels proximity to an underpass to what appeared to be Montreals main arterial road and the fact the hotel is built on the ction of two very busy roads with several sets of lights so the traffic noise was audible even with the windows shut and the traffic continued all night  The worst thing was the fire station across the road which appeared to be constantly busy as we were woken up at least  if not  times each night with the fire engine sirens going  The hotel is also near to a Mission for people suffering hard times and the little park area alongside the hotel albeit on the otherside of the road did seem to be an area they met  We were surprised by the number of beggars in the area and Montreal in general  At no time though did we feel threatened by them or did any of them do anything to annoy a passerby whilst we were there but they were noticeable For me the pros outweighed the cons for the time and reason I was there this visit but I can not say I would stay there again if I was on a longer holiday  
N => An OK stay in Chinatown Just got back from a stay at this hotel y      Overall an average hotel   booked though Priceline for  USD a night so it was a bargain   but didnt get anything exciting  Checked in late evening had requested two beds but were told this was not available  Were provided a cot at no charge The room was OK   the hotel is a U shape so a lot of the rooms face inwards  We found the hallways and public areas dark and a little dingy  The room was the same and actually even had cigarette burn ks near the sink  Not so nice  The rest of the room was clean and tidy but nothing exceptional  Bed was a little lumpy Overall an average stay  I wouldnt recommend paying much more than what we paid for this hotel  
N => Disappointed Stayed at this Holiday Inn recently for a week and was disappointed  While the amenities were nice enough the price paid night did not result in the kind of service desired  The room was okay but the key card had to be reset after every use very annoying during a six day stay  There was a great deal of difficulty in confirming the reservation and ensuring the proper credit card was charged  Also while I provided my quotPriority Clubquot membership on check in it was not entered until check out so any perks due were not provided  
N => Not impressed Wasnt very impressed  Many little things added up to me wanting to stay clear in the future  two lights were broken when I arrived bulb blown in one and the switch missing on the other  The service man replaced the bulb but said there was nothing he could do about the other  How about replace the lamp When I checked out two days later the lamp was still just an ugly ornament in the room  noise carries    there must have been a school group in the hotel as at  AM both nights I was woken up with a lot of loud chatting in the hallways  remote control was old and hard to use  the hotel is very dark and dreary  Not a very cheery atmosphere at all  I think it is quite old  Time for a reno   the view from the window was of the inner portion of the building which was a bed of rock on the roof of the restaurant  Uuuuuugly  when checking in they neglected to give me the breakfast coupon that apparently I was entitled to Oh well  
N => No privacy I stayed in this hotel for few times  Here are my experiencesa There was no privacy at all the cleaners just opened the doors without knocking happened everytime I stayedb One time the bathroom light was burned out the hotel would not fix it due to no one worked after hoursThe only things I liked this hotel were close to ChinaTown good underground parking 
N => We recommend this hotel  
N => a pleasant surprise  
N => Hotel was good enough for our stay  
N => Avoid this hotel  
N => Long Time Ago       
N => worst trip ever  
N => Not suitable for young children  
N => YIKES Although the staff was very friendly we would never return to this hotel nor recommend it to anyone  It smelt of stale cigarette smoke and although we were told that our room was non smoking we had an ashtray in the room  The beds had non fitting sheets just multiple layers of blankets kinda perplexing  The box spring was also covered in a plastic that looked it was just quickly taped up   kinda looked suspicious  We had no alarm clock in the room it was dark and kinda spooky with very dirty walls and ceilings that looked like they were about to crumble on you  We slept every night with the lights on the chandelier in our room reminded us of a haunted movie not all the lights worked some were half dimmed  The view from our window was of a stairwell with garbage bags  Good thing our window didnt openThe area was though perfect for us  As we were walking distance to Rue St Catherine which is where we spent most of our holiday Thank goodness for that as I am not sure that we would of stayed there the  nights  
N => Critters I referred my three friends to this hotel because it was close to one that I was staying in  It wasnt great but also wasnt expensive   all was ok until my friend got home and went to the dor to find out she was covered in BEDBUG BITES  It was then that I logged on here and discovered other reviews citing the same nasty problem  
N => Awful   sick from bed bugs I just returned from this hotel and I am covered in bed bugs  Im really hoping none came back with me   I got back at midnight  The infestation was so bad that these quothard to spotquot fellows were not hard to spot but crawling all over the bed and sheets  I collected them and took some to reception  They pretended to be shocked but showed me a newspaper clipping in French about them that they conveniently had on hand for this new problem On top of that I couldnt shower because the shower was broken in my room  So I had to go and give a paper at a conference covered in bites itching on little sleep and with no shower They changed my room after two nights other hotels were full  Both rooms were dirty  The cleaning people made the bed with the remote trapped inside   clearly not changing sheets despite bug infestation  Also hairs in the bathroom etc that stayed even after daily quotcleaningquot The wifi   which really sold me on this hotel   never worked the whole time I was there  The owners were not available to talk to Ive never had such a bad hotel experience although the staff were nice  
N => Weekend Surprise Rooms small but rate affordable  a night but lost a good night sleep because of a wedding downstairs that was going full blast with thumping beat that shook our bed at  AM  After we complained at the front desk they said another     minutes and they would talk to the manager  The noise continued from the restaurant and did not quite down until   AM  When I complained at the front desk the next day no apologies  quotIts over now whats your problemquot This is on top of a leaky AC that was so high up I couldnt reach controls no TV remote a lamp not plugged in  we had to move the mattress to reconnect and toilet paper holder that kept falling off the wall  It was not worth the  a night for this mess  
N => Oy Totally Vey Remember the Soup Nazi from Sienfeld If he opened a hotel in Montreal this would be it First let me say that the room that my husband and I stayed in tis past weekend was fine    on the small side but clean and relatively well appointed with good AC and a comfortable bed  No extras but perfectly adequate and reasonably priced  Since we do a good deal of international travel were not expecting an American style suite hotel everywhere we go We are expecting though to be treated as guests not as an annoyance  It started when we arrived and the gentlemen at the front desk treated us as if we were interrupting his evening  The same people are running the hotel and a large adjoining restaurant so their good humor is obviously spread thin    really thin We paid to park on their lot behind the hotel where we were greeted by an officious young man who    despite the giant size of the lot and almost no one parking there    directed us into a space centimeter by centimeter  He also told us to leave a slip of paper on our dashboard with our room number on it  So it was a quite a surprise when the front desk called our room at about  AM to tell us in the snappiest way possible to get downstairs right away because we had parked quotincorrectlyquot and had blocked in one of their employees  I was sound asleep when they called but did have the presence of mind to ask what the make and model of the car was  Not mine  When i convinced the ticked off guy that it wasnt my car he ordered me to go back to sleep  No apologies  No goodnight sorry I woke you up So I got up to go to the bathroom and the toilet paper holder fell off the wall Breakfast is only served until  so my husband and I got up extra early so we wouldnt miss it  The owners run an Indian buffet restaurant so we thought it would be a treat  But somehow in a city of fine bakeries and cafes the owners had reduced breakfast to a bag of superket white bread a bag of commercial bagels a box of cereal a carton of OJ and some containers of PB and J  They had a toaster and a hot plate with a carafe of coffee  At  AM on the dot they whisked the whole breakfast away including the coffee no refills for you   We went out for the day and came back to find our room made up but with no soap    just a sliver left over from our morning showers  In the morning my husband went to the front desk and asked for soap  Turns out they had run out but did manage to dig up one little bar for us to share by apparently cannabalizing another rooms supply  Okay there were a couple of huge CVS type stores around the corner where they could have gotten soap but I guess that would have cost money While my husband took his low suds shower I tried to use the WiFi to check my e mail  Oops    password needed and a charge for WiFi use Quel surprise I called down to the front desk for the password and was told that the only guy who knew about the WiFi was really busy and could I call back in  minutes I ided to forget it and take my own low suds shower  We didnt even bother with the PB and J on white breakfast Did we have a great weekend in Montreal despite staying at this hotel You bet Montreat is a ton of fun with LOTS happening on summer weekends  Could you find a better hotel You betcha 
N => Greatest Hotel ever stayed at This was the greatest hotel we ever stayed at  For the low price of  we didnt expect much  When we went up to the room we found ourselves in a hidden gem  A cozy room tastefully orated and a bed that makes you tiered when you look at it  Me and my wife relaxed in the jacuzzi and fell right asleep due to our long flight  I had the most pleasant sleep in my life  The beds were comfy and the air conditioning was powerful enough to even make a Montreal e seem like ch  The room was well kept and the staff very friendly  We will definetly be staying here next time we visit Montreal 
N => Crooks The same experience happened to me as the first poster  My friends and I booked the AK for the Canadian Grand Prix e    When I originally made reservations in late il I was quoted a price of  per night and was also given a confirmation number  I was called two weeks before our stay and was told that the price was going to be  per night  Even though I gave them my confirmation number they refused to honor their first quote  I then had to sign a contract  Unfortunately its impossible to get rooms in downtown Montreal during Grand Prix weekend at the last minute so they knew they had us over a barrel  Combined with the rude and pompous service tiny rooms that they pass off as quotspaciousquot and construction that started at am I will never stay there again  If this hotel was located in the US I would have sued them for the fun of it 
N => do not book this hotel We booked this hotel two months ago at a confirmed rate of  per night  One week before we were scheduled to arrive in Montreal the hotel called us and had more than doubled the rate to  per night  They would not honour their original quote that we had booked for even though they had provided a confirmation number for our reservation  If you want to be sure that your travel plans are not completely ruined that you are doing business with a honest and repuitable company avoid booking this hotel  
N => It was like sleeping on a rock in the standard room  The staff were all nice and pretty friendly with good English  I was staying for  nights on business and I tagged on  extra nights for leisure at the end  I wanted to have the charges go to my business credit card for the first three nights and to pay arately for the second two  I told this to them when I called to extend my stay from  nights to   Then I told them this when I checked in  Then I told them again when I asked for a room upgrade after the first night Ill get to the reason for this in a second  After all this I ended up with  nights on my corporate card and  night on my personal card  Was this really so complicatedMore significant was how uncomfortable the beds were  I originally booked a standard room  I dont need to have anything fancy just a comfortable place to sleep  The mattress might as well have been made of rock  I had a lot of trouble sleeping and my lower back was really sore the next morning which made my first day of work a lot harder than it had to be  The next day I had to ask if they had anything more comfortable  I know it wasnt just me being picky since I had a friend along with me for the trip and she was just as uncomfortable as I was  We got upgraded to a deluxe room at no extra cost but they had already booked all the deluxe rooms for the last day of our stay so we had to go back to a standard room  The deluxe room was really pretty basic  I think the beds in those rooms should be the quotstandardquot ones  The standard room we got for our last night was pretty atrocious  In addition to the super uncomfortable beds the toilet was running though it was pretty quite turning the air conditioning down seemed to turn the heat on and the sound on the tv was really fuzzy no matter what the volume was set to  On top of all that there was a constant swishing sound like we were beside their washing machines or something The location was good for my work but I should have moved to a hotel downtown for the rest of my stay as it wasnt terribly convenient for the leisure side of my trip  It was walking distance to a metro station but it was a good  minute walk  They had a shuttle bus that would take us to the metro for free but that doesnt help for the trip back to the hotel after a long day of sight seeing or a night out  The metro ride itself was a good  minutes to get downtown of course depending on where youre going downtown The outdoor pool was nice  The first full day we were there the hot tub was out of service but it was back up and running for the rest of our stay  It was good and hot  The indoor pool didnt really look very nice but I didnt personally use it so I cant say how good it is  There seemed to be a bunch of kids there who really liked it  
N => Dont Trust the Pictures I booked a  week stay at Auberge Universel to be close to work  After one night in the musty outdated uncomfortable room I had to upgrade  A short list of the problems include stains on the mattress mold on the grout k tv and horrible wifi connection  I must say in comparison the quotDeluxequot room which isnt so deluxe was a paradise  The mattress was actually comfortable the TV was newer and the bathroom was bigger  After two weeks I ided to cancel and re book downtown its worth the cab ride  If you stay here   UPGRADE its well worth the  per night 
N => Cleaning Service TOO NOISY The front desk service was great but we couldnt sleep Because the cleaning service was extremely noisy early in the morning  I dont recommend it if you want to sleep  Do not park in the underground parking because the concrete structure is crumbling and my vehicle was cover in tinny rocks the following morning WARNING the quote we were given upon checking was different when we checked out  
N => No problems at the Auberge Universel Booked hotel through     which I highly recommend as they have some great deals Upon checking in the front desk even commented quotWow thats a great rate how did you get thatquot  Stayed in a King bed non smoking regular room   to be exact  Room was as described on their website clean comfortable though a bit dated but certainly not bad  Front desk was friendly and helpful spoke english very well  When we called for extra pillows and towels they were delivered within minutes  Bath soap is quoteuropean stylequot   in a dispenser inside the showertub and for bodyhair  If you have longer hair that needs conditioner bring your own  We did so no issues there  If you will be there for  days to a week buy the  day Tourist pass for the Metro or a weekly pass  Hotel provides free parking and a free shuttle service to the Viau Metro Station which is also about a  min walk away not bad  Grab a card from inside the shuttle if you are tired or the weather is bad you can call the hotel from the station and they will send the shuttle to pick you up again  Hotel has restaurant which we didnt try so I cant comment  Interior pool was on the small side but fine also has hot tub and sauna in same area  Exterior pool looked good but we didnt go in as it was a cool evening when we went to pool  Hotel is within walking distance to the Olympic Park Botanical Gardens Biodome and stadium also you can walk to a couple restaurants on rue Sherbrooke turn right from hotel lobby  Nothing exciting but at least there are options  Overall this was a good deal considering what the hotel offered and convenient location  Please note this is NOT in the heart of Montreal but the metro makes it very quick and simple and safe to get there  Also it is NOT the Ritz either but certainly a ent place to stay if you are on a budget and want a safe clean convenient place to stay  I would stay there again  
N => Would never stay again   even for free Stayed here two nights this month for business  The hotel was recommended by a local business collegue  The outside of the building is tolerable at best  Even the lobby isnt too bad  It has a nice bar area restaurant etc    But the nighte begins when you step onto the one and only elevator to get to your room  Checkin is on the nd floor so beware that you could end up in the quotbasementquot  Whenever the elevator doors opened I thought I was going to die  Dirty Dark Dingy carpeting  Stucco like filthy walls  Drab Old and tired looking  It almost looked as though I should be on television shooting a movie in a quotseedy motelquot  Totally disgusting Our room was dirty and in serious need of a remodel  We ched right back down to the desk to change rooms and they let us see two other rooms  Unfortunately    Our room was in the best shape out of all of them  I considered sleeping in my car  We needed to stay because it was late and this hotel is within close proximity to the business meetings  The air conditioner blew in a steady stream of stale cigarette smoke and when you turned off the air the heat kicked in and heated the room to an intolerable level  Strange suspicious looking characters walking the halls looking like they are robbing rooms too  Did not feel safe and slept with a chair holding the door handle  Horrible experience   never again  Not even if it was for free  Restaurant food gross and expensive  If there was one positive thing Id have to say the free parking  As long as you lock your car 
N => If you like your vehicle   Do Not stay here The hotel is located in a poor section of Montreal  Yet it does not have security cameras in the parking lot or any secutiry guards  Our Chevy truck was parked directly in front of the hotel next to large dark color windows where the bar is located  The hotel wants patrons to think it is secure because the parking lot has a gate  However anyone can pull a ticket and present it to the desk for a token  The token is then used to open the gate to leave  We noticed plenty of tokens are sitting in a bowl on the desk  We went to a police station to file a report with a family from Michigan who had there plates stolen  A few months back Montreal police were assigned to watch the lot until the lefts trinkled done to a few now and then The hotel also states that they have sprinklers for fire prevention in there brochure  but we could not find any in the hallways and they were none in our room  If you value your life andor your vehicle   this is not the hotel to choose  
N => Bon service   Bon repas  
N => just fine Casa Bella was a ok  Nothing fancy but the room was spacious comparing to how we usually travel  Bed was ok clean flat pillows but had two per person ac in room a big plus  Breakfast was brought to room on request and towels changed daily  Parking was free and staff were nice  No complains  
N => dont bother The room was ok but the towels are threadbare and there are noextra blankets  The staff was indifferent and made it quiteclear that they didnt want to be bothered  When we asked foran extra room key they said it would be ready for us but whenwe went to pick it up they didnt have one  The breakfast isnothing great just one slice of toast an obviously store boughtcroissant and a small cup of coffee tea or chocolate  When there was a miscommunication about the breakfast beverageand we were given tea and chocolate rather than coffee andchocolate we tried to get coffee instead and were rudely informed we couldnt have it  One gets the feeling that theowner is nowhere around and just wants to cut costs I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Save yourself money time and property My brief stay at hotel Casa Bella I must say was not pleasant at all  The issue has to do with the parking available at the back of the establishment  Upon arrival I was told that the parking lot was full it only holds max   cars and would only be available when a guest left  When I was making reservations I was told that parking was available on premises no problem  The first evening my car was left on the street next to the hotel  The next morning I moved it into the Casa Bella parking lot only to be told that my keys were to be left with the front desk clerk  This was necessary in order for them to move the vehicle so that other guests could access their cars  In my car I had left in the trunk a bag with around  of my music CDs these were the only items left anywhere in the vehicle  Upon returning that evening from a walk around beautiful Montreal I noticed the cars position in the lot had changed just an observation  The following day I retrieved my keys in order to take a drive  I opened the trunk to find nothing  Empty  Gone  There was no sign not even a scratch as to forcible entry as if someone simply opened the trunk with keys and removed the bag  My girlfriend and I confronted the owner and front desk clerk in order to uncover the issue of the bag and were told as stated in their parkinghotel policy that they hold no responsibility for stolen items  Furthermore when confronted they were condescending and unapologetic suggesting that we misplaced them unknowingly  It seems that this is a family run operation  We filed a police report needless to say spending most of the afternoon at the station  We returned to the hotel and left that day  If for some reason after reading this review you plan to stay at this establishment by all means just park on the street there s more security and plenty of noise EdwardToronto ON Canada 
N => Came here to escape Travelodge Escaped to here from the Travelodge  Basically a crap budget hotel but clean and OK and better than the Travelodge in downtown 
N => Vive le Montreal This old apartmenthouse style hotel is located right in the heart of downtown montreal  Its super quiet clean amp charming  I felt like I was being treated with real care amp respect from the owners  Note to get a room that faces south so as to see downtown trees amp make sure to enjoy a beverage on the old fire escape I will be returning here the next time  
N => wonderful stay My stay in Montreal was wonderful largely because of the location value and comfort of my hotel  I was visiting my dhter at McGill University and the hotel was so convenient  I was close to her residence and I felt safe walking back to the hotel at night  
N => Save your money    I stayed in this hotel recently with my partner  We understood it was a budget hotel and werent looking for frills  Weve both stayed in many hostels and have traveled a lot however we were still greatly disappointed  The room was stuffy and dirty  Dark black stains in various areas of the carpeted floor were a huge turn off  There was rust and mold around the wall vents and cobwebs along the ceiling  There wasnt even a towel rack in the bathroom to hang our used towels   what an easy thing to provide your guests with  When we left the room during the day wed come back to find that the cleaning lady would totally turn our heat off   not down completely off  The walls are so thin that you will hear EVERYTHING from the neighbouring rooms   from casual conversation to water sloshing around the tub when they take their shower  This hotel is not even worth the budget price it offers  Id definitely put some cash towards a better hotel next time  
N => be carefull     they tried to scam us out of the deposit when we booked the hotel over the internet they charged us a   deposit     which was fine     but when we got there they charged us the full price for the room     when we went back to complain they suggested it was common practice to not refund the deposit unless you ask them to     the owners were rude and very unfriendly blaming us for the error      not to mention the rooms smell the bathrooms stink     and the walls are paper thin     if you have people that want to party all night next to you     youll be kept awake all night and try to find some sleep during the day     
N =>  PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING   A MUST  First let me say DO NOT book this hotel online as they have a hidden   cancellation fee and they will CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD IN FULL even though you are suppose to pay it in CASH when you arrive I booked through HOSTELWORLD COM I went through numerous phone calls back and forth with this hotel to try and talk to someone about cancelling my room  They told me I have to send an email to cancel  So I did  Simple right Think again When I did get a hold by phone the managerowner lets call him quotHadyquot   he told me to check my email as he was just sending me a return message  This is the quotexactquot message he wrotequotBonjourWe acknowledge receipt to your e mail message informing us about your request to cancel your booking As per our cancellation policy your card will be charged in full and we grant you a credit which is valid for a full  days from today Please advise us at least  days prior to your next arrival date and we will do our best to accommodate you provided there is availability When calling for re booking please mention Ref No           quot                                                                                       Ridiculous eh I wanted my money back  I phoned back and asked him if this was a joke  I told him I  not be able to travel there next year and he says send a friend to use it  Then I mentioned to him I would like a FULL return of my money as I never used any of your hotels services and I cancelled the next day with THREE WEEKS NOTICE I then mention to him this   cancellation fee I received AFTER I booked in an email and he says then send an email saying you want to cancel    RIDICULOUS So I go ahead and send him a cancellation message AGAIN and to credit me the full amount back on my credit card  He then send a return message with the amount I will be credited back and guess what   It was more like    I didnt care what this crook was trying to do as I knew I would get my full amount back due to the faulty misleading cancellation notice and fee  BE SURE NOT TO USE YOUR VISA     and please read further reviews especially the REAL ones you will get everything you want to know  WORST SERVICE AWARD to this hotel      apparently the rats running through the vents and crank addicts using the rooms aint a selling point eitherThanks tripadvisor for providing this service to warn fellow travellers Yours truly M  
N => A Bargain This hotel is a bargain if youre not looking for frills or luxury accomodations  When I arrived I was told my room was on the second floor  Being in the process of healing from a fracture and travelling solo I asked the desk clerk to help me with my suitcase  While she did it she wasnt very happy about it The room was very very small but did have a nice view of Rue Berri  The bathroom was probably nicer than the room  I have to say everything was very clean  My corner room was very quiet The included breakfast was quotAmerican stylequot  There were five options to choose from e g  eggs meat fruit toast and coffee or tea  The restaurant ambience was okay The location was very good  You can walk to most everything If price is your first concern I would recommend this hotel  If youre used to a little pampering and luxury this wouldnt be the place for you  
N => Worst Service Ever Dirty and had a RAT in room AC vent I booked a five night stay at this hotel via their web site back in uary   I was immediatly charged   of the total as a non refundable deposit as per the hotel policy  I was happy to do so to secure the room  In ruary plans changed and I needed to cancel one of the nights  I was prepared to eat the   deposit on that night as I had agreed to those terms  I sent an email to the hotel via their web page with this request  I waited for about  weeks and got no response  I callled the hotel and was unable to communicate in my broken French with the lady who answered  I called back and used my French speaking friend to translate  We spoke to the manager and he agreed to cancel the night but that I would have to pay the   which was fine with me  He left me a message on my voicemail confirming this agreement When I arrived at the hotel to check in there was no reservation under my name  I had my copy of the booking confirmation email that showed the initial booking of  days  The lady at the desk said that I was deemed a quotno showquot for the previous night which is the one that I had cancelled months earlier  I told her that I had cancelled and that the manager was aware  I was given a room but charged   for all five nights  I complained and was told that I would have to speak to the manager in the morning I went up to my room and could not BELIEVE that I had just paid for such a dirty small and smelly room  The carpet was filthy the furniture was broken and the places smelled of recent extermination chemicals  The bathroom was ginally better but was extremely dark and dingy  It was also very loud and not condusive to sleeping without earplugs  On the second morning I could hear a persistent scratching coming from the ventilation gate  I got up on my bed to look and observed the rear end and tail of a rat scurrying away  The rat made only that one appearance and I dont think it left the ventilation and got in the room Later in the week I met with the manager  He denied ever talking to me even tho I had written his name at the time and that there was a phone message on my machine from him He told me that I was LUCKY that he ided to give me the room as my quotno showquot on the first night cost him hundreds of dollars has he could have rented the room for more  I kept reminding him that I had paid in full and that I along with him had cancelled that night per his hotel policy more than three months ago paying the   penalty  He eventually gave me  back which is about half of what I should have gotten  It was very frustrating as he knew I was stuck and used that as leverage  I asked to cancel the entire reservation and he said that I would get no refund for the entire  nights He was EXTREMELY RUDE and blamed everything on me The icing on the cake so to speak was the last day  I asked how to get to the airport bus  The manager said he could sell me tickets and book that bus for me and I agreed thinking that he was trying to make up for all the other hassles  I was wrong  He arranged the free shuttle bus to pick me up and sold me a ticket for  for the airport bus  When I got to the bus station I was advised that the ticket I had was FRADULANT and INVALID  I had no time to return to the hotel to complain and was forced to buy another ticket so I didnt miss my flight Needless to say I warn anyone who stays at CHAMPS DE S that the owner is a scam artist  Once he has your cc number he will charge at will and then berate you and yell at you if you try to stand up to him STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL 
N => Cheap clean and well located I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel on a recent trip to Montreal  I had known that there was no elavator but was not prepared for the number of stairs That aside the hotel was clean and the staff was extremely helpful  I would return to this hotel without hesitation 
N => Nice trip    till the end I really liked the hotel  It was in a fantastic location and the room while spartan served our needs as a young couple  The staff was friendly and the free breakfast was a great way to start the day  Unfortunately on our last night there was a mix up with our reservation  For whatever reason they had accidentally failed to record the reservation for our last night in the computer  Luckily we had a receipt from expedia showing that we had paid in full and specifically for what dates  It could have ended amicably there with them just letting us stay hotel not full  But alas the owner was so rude  SO rude  He said that he was being kind to let us stay and he could kick us out and send us to another hotel and that we should be grateful to him for his generosity at honoring our reservation which was not in his computer  which was their fault  I said well if we went to another hotel youd have to give us our money back  To which replied quotnot really I wouldnt  And youd be on the streetquot or something to that effect  I made a horrified face  As one would  And he said something like quotjust dont make that face stop making those faces  just be glad that you have a roomquot  I was shocked I mean    we reserved and paid for the room months prior  Its not like I had just raided his living room to sleep on the couch for a month for free and eat his groceries  My boyfriend told me to drop it  I did  But it left a bad taste in my mouth to the extent that I felt I had to write this review  I would have said  stars now its down to   Also they charge  for picking up the phone and making a call even if the other persons line is busy and the call doesnt go through  So dont try more than once to make a call you better know theyll be home or youll end up with lots of  in charges  
N => Not very impressed  I booked my hotel stay online  The pictures on their site looked pretty good and it was close to the train station  When i got to the hotel   we checked in and inquired about any nearby restaurants from where we could order from  The only response we got was that we could eat there   no other help was offered to  people that are not from Montreal and not familiar with the area  After checking in we went up to the hotel and found a room that looked like it had not been taken care of in a while cracks in the walls heat off dirty walls and even facial hair left in the sink  This was a very small room with a bed desk and bureau in it  Since there was no fridge   we went downstairs and asked for ice   of course no ice and nothing was available for us  I told myself that i only there for  nights and the first night stay hadnt even started and i wanted to leave ASAP  The first night i was there   we did hear quite a bit of noise that a semi sound proof room would not hear  The second night    little did we know   there was a Christmas party booked there with live music  I had been out for business all day and returned a little past  oclock at night and was extremely tired  All we heard for most of the night is loud music people yelling and walking around in the corridors  The next morning we got up   had our quotfreequot breakfast  Owners of the hotel inquired if we slept well due to all the noise  YEAH RIGHT Never again will i stay in that place  I would have expected much more for the price i paid  Next time i will make sure to shop around much more  
N => For the price and location it was worth it  I read all the reviews about this hotel on so many other websites and finally I ided to make my reservation  Some things were right on the money  The front desk people are not the friendliest or as bubbly as some of us might be used to but the always gave the information you requested and made other suggestions when asked  The room was really tiny I could barely move around and often stood on my bed to turn on the TV  But I realize that it is a local family owned hotel in an old building and it was just meant to serve as a place to rest my head at night  I barely spent much time in the room  The location was more than PERFECT I could walk to everywhere there were  metro stops within a stones throw from each other  The hotel gave you excellent scrumptious breakfast  The french toast was just the way I like it without the powdered sugar and the maple syrup was so good  I bought a couple bottles to bring back to the USA  In general I probably will stay here again if I go back to Montreal as it was perfect for me  There are no elevators though so you have to carry your luggage up some stairs but that is part of being in an older building  
N => Didnt even stay   and hated it I booked this hotel through Bonjour Quebec after seeing the fabulous price  dollars a night and looking at the website of the hotel  I understand why it was so cheap nowAfter getting a little nervous at the contradictory Trip Advisor reviews I ided to cancel my reservation  weeks prior to my trip  Unfortunately according to their policies there is a   fee of your entire bill for all the nights you would stay that is non refundable  It is   non refundable if you cancel within  hours  I should have been a little suspicious already of a hotel with such policies Anyways with  weeks in hand I wrote an email to the hotel to cancel iding to suck up the   cancellation fee  They wrote me back which CONFIRMED they received my email offering me a special deal to come  I lined in a subsequent email to which they never replied  At this point I got a tad worried since I didnt want the full amount charged to my credit card and called to cancel  I had to call twice because the first time the receptionist told me that she was unable to cancel the reservation and that I would have to contact the head office to which she didnt have the number  UMMMM WHAT Im quite sure that this little hotel has no head office to which she strangely could not connect me to  The second time I called I received a different receptionist who cancelled my reservation  So imagine my surprise when I ended up receiving a   dollar charge from the hotel after I failed to show up for my reservation  I ended up having to contest the charge through my credit card company of course the hotel didnt fight it because they had no means to Im sure they just do this to everyone perhaps some people wouldnt notice or wouldnt want to deal with it  Im just a student so that did affect my budgetAnyways I never stayed there but after an experience like that I would never want to and would tell everyone else never to go 
N => A horrible experience Was there to stay from th and th ch  incl Already on arrival I was treated very badly by the owner and hadto leave on th because I could not take any more insults  I was humiliated and demeaned by the him and when I askedhim if i could find any cafe or restaurant around or for that matterabout anything he just waved me off and said that he did not know He refused to even look an address up for me on the receptionscomputer that was connected to internet  He was extremely rude This he was in front of other guests his staff and his familymembers  On arrival he took extra deposit of  dollars from me cash onthe side although I had paid deposit of USD   through mycard via internet initially and also paid for the Hotel in cash onarrival in advance Even though I was extremely tired after my journey I sensedthat something was wrong amp I reacted to it after I went up to theroom and realising that he did not include that CAD in thereceipt that he gave me I came back from the room and toldhim to give me a receipt for the  CAD as deposit too He arrognatly said that He sometimes charged a deposit of CAD etc  and no receipt was needed for that and if I wanted to stay there I had to follow HIS rules and I should begrateful that he took only CAD  I demanded a receipt and oninsistence he magnanimously wrote on the paper that he hadgiven me earlier quotdeposit quot cash Later on he denied that I had given him extra deposit of  dollars and refused to pay it back but after several heated arguments and a long chat with his staff who seemed to be very much afraid to tell him that I was right hence she wouldlose her job and on presentation of the paper he hadangriy signed and on which he had written   Deposit  and probably realising that he was wrong I got at last thatdeposit back too when I checked out On th  Intially he did not want to pay it back and told me to be satisfiedwith refund of the CAD     USD that I had remittedthrough my card on the day I booked or leave that too  Iperceived it as him telling me to quotjust get lostquot It was very insulting and humiliating and I really felt extremely sad amp cheated and I told that to one of his staff and she promised to talk with him after which as I mentioned earlier it seemed that he realised what he had done  It is very sad Info about internet that there was internet connection in everyroom given to me by this man on the phone when I phoned from Sweden did not turn out to be correct at all He had also told me that I did not need to a laptop with me since they had one in their cafe for guests to use The other staff and his wife were extremely nice to me but alas I had to leave the Hotel because it would have culminated in a bigger row and I felt horribleand sick because of the atmosphere that this mancreated for me He seemed to have some selected customers with whomhe was very much buddy buddy as soon as they appeared Moreover the rooms were very small the water in the washroom very much fluctuating from luke warm to verycold Nowhere to hang clothes apart from some hooks although Igot some hangers on requesting for them  One could hear doors banging and floorboardsscreeching on every arrival of guests late at night walking  One could hear the guest in neighbouring rooms talking veryclearly nd also when they were engaged in acts of lovemakingwhich was a quite uncomfortable amp disturbing I do not wish to make more comments on that at this stage I would class this place as under   star hotel I must in all fairness mention here that both his wifeand the staff tried to make it as comfortable for meas they could  I am certainly very grateful to them But sadly the damage was already done Wrote to HostelsWorld to complain and also hoped to get my money Back for the period between th th incl  But they HostelWorld have never bothered to reply It was a horrible experience  
N => basic accommodation We were visiting my sister who lives in Montreal but this hotel was part of a package deal with airfare on Travelocity that was about the same price as the airfare alone so we tried it  The staff was friendly and helpful  The breakfast was good as others have mentioned   it is hot and made to order  The rooms were spartan and small but not terrible although they are more what you would expect from a pension in europe and not a typical north americal hotel  keep this in mind and you should be fine  close to old montreal and walking distance to st  catherine st  etc  there is a tv in the room as well  
N => Low budget rooms in a ent location Small rooms and a little grimy but in a ent location  The breakfast that was included was a good deal however not just muffins and cold cereal  Not a place to go if youre looking for a romantic getaway but if you want a cheap place to sleep when exploring Montreal perhaps this is for you  Booked on Travelocity using quotbest buyquot rules so I had to pay up front and they wouldnt refund when I wanted to check out early so they arent very flexible in those regards  Book for  night to see if you like the place first    we were stuck for   uggh  
N => Total HORROR Story I booked this hotel thru Orbitz and the price was right shame on me and Orbitz keeps the cash no matter what happens  I arrived at the hotel in mid afternoon aminities were sparce and hotel was small  There were two grimy young ladies with caked makeup sitting in the lobby checking everyman who entered  I went to the desk and presented my Orbitz confimation and the credit card I used to make the reservation  Lady told me she needed my License and I opened my wallet to show it to her where upon she told me to take it out as she had to COPY my License and Credit Card  I have never been asked to do this anywhere in  years of traveling  My knowledge of Montreal goes a long way and Credit Card Fraud and ID theft is rampant there  I told the clerk I had given and showed her all she would need and she called the owner who told me that if I wanted to stay in his hotel I would have to follow his rules  Of course I did not stay and wonder to this day if any ID theft cases imminated from that Hotel  Orbitz told me to go to you know where as reservation is Non Refundable even if the Owner makes it impossible to stay  Orbitz got the owner to agree to not copy my information but it was  hours later and I already found a more reputable hotel  That is my story folks so if your personal information is of any value to you do not ever book or stay at this hotel  
N => Adorable Hotel Really angered to see so many negative and seemingly mostly petty reviews of this place because we had a perfect stay Staff was very accommodating the free breakfast was AMAZING  options to chose from all made to your specifications this was a far better stay at such a quaint place than a Holiday Inn and the like could have ever offered be its because we are from New York City and are used to smaller rooms and lesser conveniences but who cares if you have  keys Who cares if theres no elevator It was clean comfortable the rooms were smaller yes  but we came to see the city NOT spend all our time in a hotel room and very convenient to walking to old town and down town  You are absolutely getting what you pay for and this place is a deal Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Hotel Champ De s 
N => If only they didnt have bed bugs     Its actually pretty sad  The hotel was adorable rooms were small but for what you pay it was fine  We went to sightsee and not sit in the hotel so it was fine with me  Make sure you book online the price otherwise is over    not worth it  If you book through a hostel website hostelworld its only like  per person  Everyone was really nice and the free breakfast was good  They have one huge problem though   BEDBUGS We stayed for  nights and each night my friend had huge bumps on her  One on her eye  on her arm  on her neck  We finally complained and they tried to blame it on an allergy to the soap which obviously would not cause huge red lumps which looked like mosquito bites  They finally changed our room but the same thing happened  She went to the dors when we got home and they said that they ewre bed bugs and she had an allergic reaction  We had a really good experience otherwise but they really need to do something about this 
N =>  star hoStel not  star hotel This should not be classified as a hotel but rather a hostel The room was the size of the bed with about one foot of walking space around the bed  I had to store my suitcase in the bathroom  The bed was like a brick pillows were paper thin I had to do a late check in but the reception closes at pm so they taped a piece of paper with my NAME on it to the front door with a number to call to be let in  This was a huge issue with security for me  There is NO parking whatsoever provided for the guests I could hear the neighbours farting   the walls were seriously that thin There is no clock in the roomThe bathroom floor had pubic hair scattered on it I met  staff members one of them was friendly the other was rude I would never recommend this hotel to anyone it was money wasted not well spent I ended up staying at the Delta Montreal the second night an upscale  star hotel for  less than what I paid for this hole in the wall hostel  
N => Good Service but watch out for the BED BUGS My family and I were lucky to have found a hotel in high season and the service of the hotel was fine however each of us occupants there were four of us received dozens of Bed Bug bites  I had thirty on my body  Unfortunately we did not file a formal complaint but we did mention it to the owner hoping something would be done  All he said was quotThats wierd  I was in that room a couple of nights ago and nothing happened to me   quotBe Careful  
N => Avoid this hotel The only nice things I will say are that the free breakfast was good and the staff was very friendly  I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone except be someone I didnt like  The room was incredibly small with about  feet of space between the bed and the wall on  sides  I had to put my suitcase on the floor in the bathroom to open it and there was no furniture to put clothing  There was no clock remote for the tv and the reception on the tv was bad  The water in the shower turned from hot to cold and back again by itself no ice machine and the  vending machine they had was broken so i had to get beverages from the restaurant which wasnt always open  Dont stay here  
N => This place was pretty bad When we arrived we were directed to a room that was the size of a telephone booth and pretty grubby  Also we discovered that it was a  story walk up this is not mentioned on their web site  When we requested a different room we were given a larger but still dirty room on the th floor and were told that we would have to change rooms the next day  The next morning  A M  we took our luggage no hotel staff to do this down to the desk left it there and were told to return later in the day  We returned at approximately  P M  and were told what room to go to but that we would have to move again the next day  All things considered we ided to check out and take our chances elsewhere  The desk clerk was not helpful and after fooling with the computer for  or  minutes wandered off the the restaurant for coffee  After waiting about  minutes I went into the restaurant and asked for a receipt of the transaction  She reluctantly printed the receipt stating she didnt know I wanted one  Once I got the receipt I immediately noticed that they were charging us for an extra night When I requested the bill be recalculated deleting the erroneous charge she responded that the computer automatically added the night after a certain time and she could not change it  Im still trying to get the credit  
N => Dont stay here Good location but very poor rooms  Very small with an even smaller bathroom and no coffee maker  Aircon in theory but no control over it and windows locked shut  Paper thin walls floors and ceilings   you get to know all about your neighbours without meeting them but dont expect to get a good nights sleep  Just watch what you say Rooms approached up a dark and dismal narrow winding staircase   no elevators Breakfast is included but did not arrive until   Its on the menu at   but not worth half the price And then finally when we got home they had put through an extra   on the credit card They will not answer emails asking why  
N => Clean basic   
N => Good Hotel   
N => Now Champs Sur Mer w tiniest rooms in town  
N => Questionable Reservation Practices  
N => Worth consideration  
N => tr s mauvais service et propete Epouvantable  
N => Very good modern hotel Very comfortable rooms with not just free internet but in room PCs  Included continental breakfast was a bonus  Good location close to Old Town and a choice of metro stations just a short walk away  
N => If you are looking for a great hotel in central MTL   STAY HERE So thanks to everyones reviews and honest opinions on tripadvisor we were not disappointed when we booked this hotel for our  night stay this past weekend  We visit Montreal occasionally more recently we have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and the Travelodge in Montreal  The holiday inn Express is always okay   but it was fully booked so we tried something new and were pleasantly surprised with Hotel Dauphin  Great Location close to shopping chinatown old montreal  Great Price  it was about  less than Holiday inn express  Included a really good self serve continental breakfast  Amazing Room   clean very modern for a hotel with free high speed access unheard of  Great service the hotel front staff very helpful pleasant  We were travelling within a group of  families and all were very happy with the accomodations  No complaints Yes the parking is a block away but it is not really a big deal just glad that our vehicles were safe Some guest were having problems with their magnetic cards to access the elevator but no biggie I just needed to jiggle mine to work  I have to say it is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at within this price range love the modern ammenities Kudos to the staff amp management of this first class independant hotel  We will definately rebook on our next visit in ober and recommend to all 
N => Oh La La   Tres Amazing Cant find a better deal in Montreal  Great location great price  Nothing to complain about  I give it three thmbs up 
N => Didn t like it at all   poor service Didnt like it at all  Staying was terrible  Access is very bad they give you a scheme to get to their parking so you have to go all way around to get to it  No information on their website that parking is very limited  parking spots in underground garage Thats it and is  per night  Room keys dont work you have to swipe it   times to get into your room or to start elevator we saw all customers having same problems  Breakfast which was included in price was very cheap   no choice at all and same food every day  Stuff is very limited nobody from management available on weekends and if you want to speak to manager ladies on reception say to wait till Monday Stuff dont smile at all  Although hotel was empty we were given room with window facing back side with terrible view no point to stay downtown and room was very small  They dont have pool in the hotel  I am completely unsatisfied and will never stay there again  NEVER 
N => Terrible time   our car got damaged in their garage Dont stay there We were staying at Le Dauphin Centre Ville hotel with my family my husband and his parents for the weekend we came from Toronto  They have a very small garage parking which is  per night  You have to get out of car to slide you room key to enter it so my hubby did that door opened and when we start doing inside door hit our car my husband had to make reverse to save car from bigger damage and door has broken deflector We were so disappointed and upset we wanted to see management right away but were told that nobody is available until Monday and this happened on Saturday and were leaving next day  We called police and officer confirmed that door goes down too fast and motion sensor is installed to far inside in the garage  I spoke to their their manager Milot and he was mean to me Instead of reimbursing damage and apologies I heard quotcall your insurancequot And we are their customers whose weekend was totally spoiled NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN  They dont value their customers and they have UNSAFETY parking garage Dont even want to think of what could happen if my husband didnt react so fast   we wont be able to go back to Toronto next day    VERY UPSET 
N => There are better hotels in Montreal This hotel is fairly new  If I return I will definetly find another hotel  The price however was not bad for what we received  At arrival no one helped us with our luggage my mother had to push one of the carts to the front of the hotel to get our luggage from the car and than up the elevator to our third floor room  There were two staff members present and not a lot of visitors in the lobby  Someone could have offered us some sort of help we had just arrived from Quebec and we had more than one suitcase  One benefit was the computer in the room this was a nice touch which I have never seen before  The t v  was nice and so was the modern feel of the room with a nice shower  It was clean and the location was close to chinatown which is a nice place to visit and eat  The street this hotel is located on is not great compared to other hotels close to more attractions  This hotel also does not have parking and our parking thing got messed up where we ended up paying more than we should have  The beds were hard which some people I guess like but way to hard for me  Close to Old Montreal we were able to walk a few blocks and we were there  There was also a free breakfast which was conveniant  Our family first traveled to Quebec than Montreal and this hotel does not compare to how nice our other hotel was  Just think in a few years the computers and the tv will be outdated and it  be hard to replace all of them making this hotel older faster  Montreal is a nice city and I think there are other better hotels out there  If your just traveling for business this is probably made better for that than family traveling  the hotel also did not seem very busy in our stay which I am not sure is a good bad thing  It was quiet which was nice  
N => I will return great hotel not very busy brand new  it lacks certain amenities   but not necessary ones  pool restaurant very limited but ok breakfast PROS fast windows vista dell pc in every room  under  mins to chinatownn   mins to st  catherines shopping area   mins to the startof old montreal  under  mins to Place D armes metro station in the convention ctr    inch flatscreen tv  big fridge  one of the nicest bathrooms but no tub only shower safe acesscards neede for elevator frequent cleaningCONS limited light controls in room all or non virtually  scan cards didnt work that well  short hotel no views   beside a condemed haunted house but still good area  no restaurant only breakfats  limitedI will return to this hotel all I really care about is location and the state of the rooms and for  people this hotel was great  pristine modern nice room and close  everything 
N => Poor Service This is a smoke free hotel in the heart of the city  The rooms are a bit small but all right  But the service is very bad   We checked into our room to find out it was very HOT  So called up the desk and they instead of fixing the AC gave us another room  An overkill but we said all right and moved to the other room  Two lights werent working which I could live with as there were  lights in the room  But one of them was flickering and we wanted it changed  We stayed there for two days and they changed the light the next day  Another thing none in the front desk can suggest things to do in the city  They give u a brochure and ask u to figure it out   be the staff did not like to work on the first of y but they should not have kept the hotel open then  Breakfast and ease of access to nearby point were the high points   I would not stay here again  
N => veryvery nice I read some reviews on tripadvisor com and we ided to choose this hotel  It was a wise ision good location very clean and recently reated roomsinternet and PC in your room and very friendly staff  The breakfast was not something exceptional but we had Rue St Denis just  min walking so a lot of places where we could have a very good french breakfast  
N => Bon hotel mais service   revoir  
N => DISGUSTING INFESTED WITH BUGS  HORRIBLE STAFF I read the reviews and I thought this would be a good place to stay but if you pay attention to the reviews the last good one was before   I know there isnt a Sam or Eddy there now  It is  Chinese brothers  I stayed there for a week while I was touring the universities  The were so rude just snooty in general very nosy  I think they even go in your room when you arent around  The place is infested with hookers seriously  EVERY night I heard guys coming in and out of rooms loud sex  So noisy as well  Not safe window latches broken  Fan in washroom broken  breakfast is literally bread and instant coffee I woke up with bed bugs bites all over me it became swollen and so itchy and i mean all over  My boyfriend had it too  I went to  dors and they both told me it was bed bugsScabies  I was extremely upset  I gathered my things and was leaving I told him I was not paying the remanding amount which was over  because I had to pay to see  dors each as well as pay for a prescription  They grabbed me my stuff  guys my bf wasnt there when I was leaving  They basically trapped me finally I gave them half  I was so upset crying  They yelled at me telling me It was my fault and there was no such thing as bed bugs  This isnt just the worst hotel this family is beyond rude no manners disgusting people that would treat a GUEST this way  Someone that stayed over one week  They even treatened to call the cops on ME when I asked for a receipt  PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE THIS PLACE NEEDS TO bE SHUT DOWN  IT IS DISGUSTING INFESTED WITH PROSTITUES AND INSECTSDO NOT GO HERE THERE ARE A TON OF HOTELS YOU WILL REGRET IT  
N => Bed Bug Central My boyfriend and I ided to stay in Montreal one night just for the fun of it  We walked in and asked for a room  It seemed to have some reation going on but we didnt care During the evening my boyfriend kept saying he was being bitten by something but there wasnt anything anywhere  When we finally did got o sleep he woke me at am yelling about there being bedbugs and him being bitten  Sure enough we throw on the lights and check the edges of the matress and there were bedbugs scurrying away as well as under my pillow  My boyfriends armes were red with the bites as was his torso  We went downstairs right away and told them there were bedbugs everwhere and we didnt want to stay there and wanted our money back  He pretended he didnt speak English  He wouldnt give us our money back  DONT EVER GO THERE I would have been happy with my money back after that I didnt feel clean again until I got home and showered They have BUGS They know they have bugs they werent surprised  We even killed some bedbugs and left them on the nightstand 
N => dont stay here    This was the worst experience Ive had at any hotel the rooms are really dirty and miserable for the price you pay this place is not recommended  
N => Barely adequate  I chose this place for a one night stay for my wife and I during our y  vacation to Canada because of its location and price  The place appeared to be in the middle of reation  Or rather it appeared that our room had been recently reated but the common areas still needed a lot of work On the plus side convenient location for tourist activities and the price was very reasonable We hope to visit Montreal again but we will look for another place to stay with the realization that it will likely cost substantially more  
N => Walked in and walked right back out i would not recomment this place to anyone  on the positve side the hotel clerk did call me a taxi for me which of course i took to a clean and safe hotel  
N => Very Friendly We spent two days in Montreal during our honeymoon Since we hadnt booked any hotels we chose this hotel by tripadvisor because of its review We have been very well  We couldnt stay there one day more because there wasnt rooms available but fortunately we met Sam reception  He was so kind to help us to find an other hotel This hotel could be compared with twothree stars european hotel RampG Italy 
N => Incredibly Convenient Location  The best part of the hotel was not only the friendly service especially Sam but the location  We flew into the Dorval airport took the airport shuttle   Canadian and it dropped us off literally less than a minutes walk from the hotel  It was very easy to find  Sam was great and carried our luggage  flights of stairs   that was wonderful We were able to walk to Old Montreal and also to Downtown area with ease  The Berry UQAM metro stop note this was an intersecting stop meaning it connected to other lines was also right on the corner  The Banque Nationale was only a couple of blocks away on St  Catherine Street   it had the best exchange rate  There is a wonderful crepe place around the corner on Maisonneuve and we loved the La Brioche Lyonnaise right on St  Denis a  minute walk Service was great  When I needed a hair dryer they came up immediately  They also assisted with using a calling card that we had just purchased  The bathrooms were clean and in good condition and we got fresh towels every day We will definitely stay here again next time we come to Montreal  
N => Cant Beat Price  A group of us stayed here over the weekend and got a great deal  In addition to its very reasonable rates parking was free and conveniently in front of the hotel  The service was overall very good Sam amp Edy were especially helpful amp cordial  Thanx to Sams recommendation a friend amp I enjoyed lunch at a great Crepes place a mere  min walk away  You just cant beat the price the clean rooms service amp LOCATION  
N => Bravo Excellent value The host was most helpful    recommended excellent restaurants shopping called taxis    Even tracked us down at a nearby restaurant when a mistake in our room assignment was recognized   Would definitely stay at this hotel again   proximity to metro St Denis St Laurent  minute walk to Old Montr al     
N => I am coming back here  Everything good about this hotel has already been said  I was looking for a central place to stay    so I could explore Montreal easily  The price we got for the hotel was much less than I had anticipated it would be    so I was prepared for less than the best    but I got more than I asked for The room was immaculately clean  I have stayed in placed X as expensive without the rooms being as clean  The room we had was not very large  But why are you going to Montreal anyway to sit in your room and watch TV We parked our car across the street for  days    and walked EVERYWHERE except the Biodome for which the subway is a  minute walk from the hotel I was not disappointed at all with this place and the hospitality of Sam and the other guy sorry other guy    I didn t catch your name will make you feel at ease and at home Montreal on the whole seems to have a high level of homeless people  Someone mentioned that this hotel was in a seedy area    but to be honest    the areas that did not seem to be seedy to me had no hotels in them either    just galleries  Hotel de LElysee felt very secure  I intend to return there and as long as the price remains as reasonable as it is I will not even shop around By the way    very close to this hotel is an Italian restaurant called quotRistorante Napoli Pizzeria quot You MUST go there buy a BOTTLE of wine and order one of their pizzas Just thinking about how good the food was brings a tear to my eye ENJOY 
N => nice  Clean room  Reasonable price  The Italian staff was extremely nice amp easy to communiicate but the other guy needed professional training in his attitude  No AC no drinking water  
N => Rude staff and extra charges appearing on my credit card I was giving a price on a phone discussion for staying at this hotel When I arrived there I paid the amount we agreed on but I was told Ive made quota good dealquot because am getting a quotdifferentquot room  At the check out the service guy Eddy asked me for an extra charge motivated by the quotextra qualityquot of the room I was given Having no consent from my side the final invoice remained with the initial amount When I got home and checked my account I was astonished to see they charged the amount they wanted on my credit card without my authorization  
N => This place is awful We made a reservation one evening and called the next day to change it from  to  days  They told us we could not do that because it was Memorial Day weekend and there was a minimum stay of  nights  If we wanted to cancel the  nights we could  We said we would call back  We called back  minutes later to cancel the  nights and talked to another person who would not allow us to cancel despite what their other representative told us  When we told them we were not happy they hung up on us  They claimed we hung up on them  They kept insisting that we needed to check their website to know their cancellation policy  I said that we did not make the reservation through their website and it was not our responsibility to know their policy  If one representative tells us we can cancel we are going to believe them  The customer service was AWFUL and we are very forgiving travelers  I would strongly recommend against this place  
N => A great place to stay  
N => Within walking distance to major attractions   
N => We do recommend it  
N => bugging out We went to Montreal spur of the moment so did not look for hotels before arriving there  Almost everything was booked when we did get there on a Saturday afternoon so we ended up here  Ive stayed in some pretty bad places around Eastern Europe and in the States as well and this one rivals any of those  The room was extremely dirty the floor was not vacuumed under the sink was a repulsive mess  But the worst of it all is I ended up with a case of bedbugs after one night and then upon return could not completely get rid of them causing us much trouble  The staff was really nice but not helpful about this situation  Stay away  
N => DO NOT book a room here YUK We booked a room here through tourism Montreal  We did not stay because it was so aweful that my wife would not even go in the room when I opened the door  Our advice would be to stay somewhere else nearby  There are many hotels in this area of Montreal that are FAR superior to this one for the same and even less money  The comments made by others about this hotel are pretty accurate  There is an aweful smell to the place that lingers in your nose after you leave  I dont know what it was but it was chemical in nature for sure  be bug spray Anyway the hotel refused to refund our deposit and we lost about  bucks but we figured that it was worth it to stay somewhere else that was clean  Check out the Hotel St Denis up the road  Thats where we went and we were very pleased by comparison  
N => Stay somewhere else I wish I would have looked this place up here before staying there  I agree with the people who thought it was dreadful  It stinks literally and is more like a dirty rooming house than a hotel  Our room was not clean nor was the bathroom  It smelled horrible  We only stayed one night without using the bathtubshower and found another place just up the road to go instead  If you are someone who prefers to stay in a clean room and feel safe about leaving your belongings there when you go out to shop then this is definitely not the place for you  
N => Absolutely disgusting This is the most filthy repulsive hotel that I have ever encountered in  years of travel  If Tripadvisor had a zero on their rating scale I would have selected it  Upon entering the building the chemical smell was so overwhelming that you could hardly breathe  It was hard to tell that you were in a hotel as the quotfront deskquot is just an opening in the wall with rude absolutely unhelpful staff of one  The room made my skin crawl  It looked like crack addicts had just left  minutes before we got there  It was horrifyingly FILTHY The carpets were bathed in putrid stains there were blood drops on it and it had obviously not been vacuumed in a LONG time as there was a multitude of tidbits coloured balls of unknown origin   all over the place  It stank so bad you had to hold your nose  There were bugs YES and hairs in the bathtub  The bathroom was not clean at all  We did not stay I wouldnt make a dog stay there and the hotel refused to credit us back for our deposit  The quotownerquot who would not speak to us apparently said that there is a  hr cancellation policy that he would not budge on regardless of the state of the room  They kept   of our money  I would not stay there if it was free  It would be cleaner to sleep on the street  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE 
N => Alittle Misleading   So I recently stayed at the Hotel de la Montagne this past weekend   st and was alittle dissappointed to say the least  My wife I and  of our friends stayed the entire Halloween weekend  rooms  After looking at their website and all of the travel websites Hotels com Expedia etc I was expecting to stay at an ULTRA modern contemporary room  ya know Plasma TV modernized contemporary furnitiure and bathroom  What they gave us was a dated room that hadnt been reated since the s  Dont get me wrong the room was huge and so was the bathroom but was very outdated  I sort of felt like it was a quotbait and switchquot  After asking to be put in one of their updated rooms they told me it was an additional  per night per room  I really didnt make a stink about it but I should  Theyre website is very misleading and shows you pictures of only their updated rooms  They should really differentiate both rooms on their website and not MISLEAD people so just beware before booking  We really wanted to go up to the roof area but it was closed as Im assuming that it was closed during this time of the year  The good thing about this hotel is that its very close to all shopping and partying as its near everything  Park across the street in the open lot itll save you money 
N => Great location poor service Good points  great location for shopping tourist sites music venues  clean well kept rooms with comfy bed and good showerCould do better  not speaking French we were treated with contempt by several members of staff   who muttered to each other in French while looking at us    doorman refused to hold the front door open whilst we dragged our suitcases into the hotel on arrival  He went off to help someone get a taxi instead  the roof Magnetic Terasse with pool is useless for guests as the roof is always full of young posers squashed up there getting sun tans and a date  Even if there was room for a hotel guest to go up there youd feel way too intimidated to actually use the tiny pool     and getting to your room is a problem as the elevators are in constant use by non guests going to the roof  Having to join a long queue behind non guests just to use an elevator to get to your room is very very poor   Breakfast  Our rate included breakfast and we had a little voucher in the keycard wallet confirming this too  However the breakfast selection is fairly poor  And despite it being a buffet the hotel charged an unauthorised unnnotified compulsory quotGratuitiequot of C   tax  They tried to charge us C   tax for the breakfast too    but after a lot of arguing at the check out desk whilst they mumbled to each other in French they reluctantly agreed to remove the charge  And this was when our rate included breakfast But they remained adamant about the unauthorised illegal grauity addition  Okay so its only  but they add it regardless of whether you left a tip at breakfast   and why would you leave a tip at a buffet breakfast anyway where no one actually spoke to us served us or in any way communicated with us So be wary of the extra illegal charges that they will refuse to remove  Be wary of being treated poorly if you dont speak French  Anticipate long queues to get the elevator to your room  Dont plan on using the pool  But the bed is comfy  
N => It was a nice place to stay The only thing that I have to say in negative aspect is that they dont have a business center  
N => Magnifique Yes our stay at the Hotel de la Montagne was magnificent After reading some mixed reviews and not to mention the only French i know is quotfrenchquot fries I started having cold feet a few days before our trip and I started looking at other alternative hotels  I finally just gave up and good thing I did not cancel my booking  Firstly getting to the hotel was pretty easy  We drove from Toronto and this was our first time driving to Montreal we found getting to the hotel was pretty easy The minute that we pulled up to the curb the porter was already taking care of our bags the car was parked in no time and we checked in in minutes  The hotel room itself was fabulous  We booked a non smoking room with  queen size beds and it was ample room for  adults  The bathroom was huge and the only thing that I can complain about at this point is the small bathtub coz me and my boyfriend were kinda hoping to take long baths together but the comfy beds more than made up for any complaints we had   to quote my boyfriend he say he felt like he was floating in the air LOL  We had a fantastic view of the city from our balcony th floor and everything was within walking distance  St Catherine st next block for shopping and Crescent St for all the clubs St Laurent st was less than  minutes cab drive Ok Ill stop gushing All I can say for anyone contemplating staying at the De la Montagne is go for it you will be wowedBapsLolo 
N => Worst Ever Stay away Should have known when I booked   I called to confirm my reservation and the desk clerk said quotcall back later Im busyquot went from bad to worse  Complained to manager she apologized assured me they would look after things and knew when we would be arriving  We arrived and were treated rudely  We had booked a package that included an elegant Sunday brunch  which we had had before at this hotel a few years ago we had dressed nicely and were escorted to the barquotThursdaysquot which was loud we informed that we were to be at the Sunday Brunch only to be told that they didnt have it anymore and to just order off the menu  The attitude and the service was awful  Turned out they just didnt bother to take us to the room brunch was now being served in We have been every other year for the last  years for a get a way we would never go back again  When I responded to a questionare and wrote an email of complaint to the hotel she was just as rude  Instead of emailing me a response she copied my letter and inserted sorry about that I then sent a letter to her supervisor no response Over   for this awful romantic getaway 
N => Total Scumbags   Stay Away These scumbags ripped me off blind just for parking there  I walked into the De La Montagne parking garage to ask how much it would be to store two motorcycles  The attendant said it was  per day  I asked if I could put two bikes in one spot which they said was fine  I left the bikes in a little nook not big enough for a car right next to the attendants  Two days later when I tried to retrieve my bikes the attendant said it would be   I told him the quoted price was day  He mumbled something about the time in or time out  Frustrated I ided to give in and looked in my wallet for  cash  After finding that I didnt have the cash this guy walked me up to the cashiers office where he said something to the counter guy in French  The counter guy then proceeded to charge me  Yes the price had doubled yet again  I screamed for a bit at the parking lot attendant and eventually turned over my credit card  This was a big mistake  I should have called the cops  Having a long day ahead of me on motorcycle and trying to beat the rain cost me to settle up with this terrible hotel quickly and move along  Now that I am home I see that their website does in fact say that their parking rates are day with no conditions attached  I have no idea where this ridiculous figure came from and now I have no recourse except to tell my story  Please dont stay with these rip off artists  
N => Good Location  but you can find a better hotel Stayed for  nights in y to celebrate our anniversary  Booked a contemporary king with balcony    just like the picture supposedly on hotels com  What we got was a run of the mill room  Actually had a king sized bed with a quotqueenquot sized headboard    and definitely not contemporary or updated as the pictures show   The bathroom was good sized with a arate shower    the shower had a very inexpensive plastic showerhead and was fairly small  also had a tub faucet about quot off the floor of shower   for whatever reason The hotel needs to be updated    shows its age from the s  The lobby is dated as well with velvet sofas heavy woods  The lounge on the th floor does a lot of business creating a long wait for the elevators on friday and saturday nights  The pool was supposedly on the same floor   went up twice but never found it    no one around to ask  Had cable TV but most were in french and picture quality wasnt very good  Had a trouser press and shoe shine machine in room which was nice  Ice had to be quotboughtquot from the concierge at  a bucket plus a tip of course not available to get yourself  Parking a little high at  a day   overall not bad    but not a   star hotel  By the way tried to write a review at hotels com     they didnt put it online or respond   apparently they have a different agenda than tripadvisor  
N => Like a dream we didnt want to leave WOW is all I can say about this hotel The lobby is just as beautiful as the pictures suggest   gorgeousWhen we got to our room I squealed with delight   it was amazing I dont know how we got it for the price  The room was large and gorgeous  The furnishings were very tasteful The bed was super comfortable and the bedding was of a high quality  It was a pleasure to sleep in  Large TV nice mini bar as well as a shirt press and shoe shine machineThe bathroom was lovely too   arate shower and bath two vanities bathrobes slippers  We were in heaven It was cold and snowy in Montreal when we were staying there and I have to say we were quite happy just staying in our hotel with just a few trips outside to visit old montreal and go shopping and to a hockey game Every afternoon we went down to Thursdays bar for happy hour   two for one cocktails It was so fabulous and everyone was so friendly We stayed for  nights and didnt want to leave    I would go back to Montreal again just to stay at this hotel 
N => Great location Best part about this hotel is its location  Short walk to  Metro lines and right downtown  Our room was in very good shape large and clean  Very nice to have a balcony though you have to drag your hotel chairs out there if you want to sit and its nice to be able to open door or window for fresh air  Our room faced Rue Crescent which is crowded with bars and restaurants  Nice to be close to them for drinking and dining but not so nice for noise even with windows closed On cold nights it was quiet but when it got warm people were out and music was playing until quite late  Were not really night owls so for us this was a bit inconvenient  Perhaps a room on the other side would offer a bit more quiet Overall this hotel was a good choice for us at the discounted price but Id probably think twice about staying there in the heart of the summer party season if I wanted to go to bed before am  
N => Bad experience The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful  The rooms were nice enough but we were uncomfortable staying in a place where the staff talked down to us and were unwilling to assist usmake basic adjustments etc  
N => Not even an apology for poor service I had dinner at Thursdays Restaurant which is owned by La Montagne Hotel Montreal rue la montagne  The horrible service I recd was the worst in my entire working career  We were  guests of which  were my guests from the U S A  We ordered  meals  Three were served satisfactorily  Mine was completely forgotten about  After waiting for  minutes and after everyone had completely eaten their meals since it was already  p m  I went to the desk and asked why my meal was not served  I then said not to bother and that I needed to speak to the manager  The president of the Hotel came and asked me what the problem was  I told him that I was not going to pay for the meal as a result of this oversight  I went back to my table to join my guests when within  minutes quothequot the president in his great wisdom ided to have my meal prepared and subsequently had the waiter bring it out  I told the waiter who by the way was courteous but perhaps somewhat to blame that it was rather late and my guests were anxious to leave and therefore I turned him away  I was presented with the bill  I then brought it to this president and told him that as a result of their poor service I was humiliated in front of my guests leaving them with the impression that I simply ided not to order a meal because I wanted to save money I was further shocked since no apology was offered  The best this president was capable of compensating me for the poor service was to say he will not charge me for the meal that quotI returnedquot The embarrassment contined  When I had brought forth the bill and once again pointed out why I wasnt prepared to pay he instructed one of his waitors to call the police claiming that I intentionally was refusing to pay the bill because I wanted a quotfree mealquot  Needless to say although I have spent more than  on meals at this establishment in the last  years and recommended many clients to stay at the La Montagne that will now come to an end Never again will La Montagne every profit from my visits or friends to its Hotel premises nor the Thursdays Restaurant P S  I will dispute the amount charged on my credit card and when contested by the management I then might consider suing La Montagne Hotel in small claims court for making inappropriate threats and harrassing me in front of my guests  
N => Smokiest hotel Ive ever stayed in Just stayed at the La Montagne Hotel in Montreal this past weekend ust    This is the smokiest hotel Ive ever stayed in  If you do not like the smell of cigarette smoke do not even think about staying here  Even though there are non smoking floors the rooms still stink  We had to be moved from our original quotnon smokingquot room because of the overpowering smell  The next room we were moved to was just as bad  We had to leave the two balcony doors open with the air conditioning blasting to help circulate some air  Not what you expect when paying almost  USnight to stay in one of their luxury suites  
N => Crappy time in Montreal Our room had a musty smell  The music from the bar above on the roof kept us up all night  I would not come back to this hotel or recommend it  Most Montrealers think its a great hotel    I still am trying to figure it out  I would not come here unless I wanted to drink and be loud  
N => Room accomodations were nice    Room accomodations were nice    but the rest of the hotel facilities were dated and appeared to cater priily to the young college crowd  Rooftop pool is open to the walk in public not just hotel guests so get there early if you want a lounge chair to enjoy the summer sun  Staff were friendly and helpful  which is why I rate this hotel a four star  but I found that to be true of almost all Montrealians which made my first trip to this city a most pleasant one  Restaurant quotThursdayquot dinner was a fiasco but again headwaiter tried to make good on poor kitchen prep and was sincerely apologetic  All in all an O K  place to stay if you are young and like to party  Hotel city location is fantastic  
N => Relaxed stay  
N => It was great  
N => Fantastic We enjoyed this hotel so much I included it in my Blog encouraging readders to try it outGreat value plus plus  We had a family get together  
N => Adequate Accommodations but lacking in customer service    This is a reasonably priced comfortable hotel that is very conveniently located near Sherbrooke metro station The room one queen bed with private bath and a small balcony was clean  However if you stay here be warned that there is next to no customer service  When I called the reception to ask for extra towels I was told quotyou were supposed to have them in the room noquot I was not even transferred to housekeeping and the reception attendant rudely hung up the phone  In the end I had to call housekeeping myself Also if you stay here I would advise skipping the breakfast  I waited for an hour for food only to be told that because of some kind of problem in the kitchen they were unable to make a crepe  At this point I was so frustrated I cancelled the order only to be given no apology or compensation  
N => Wholly inadequate conduct Unfortunately we never got the chance to see the rooms of this hotel due to their clear mistake taking our reservation  I was initially impressed by there quick response to E mails but on our arrival found they had made a reservation for tember rather than ober  Having travelled up from Toronto with visiting friends and children we were then told there were no rooms available and recommended a quotsimilar hotel just down the road  This turned out to be no more than a hostel and clearly not equivalent  I did receive an E mail apology on my return home and the offer of a   discounted room rate to be used before the end of the year      a response I felt was quite inadequate for our inconvenience  A disheartening experience to start our Montreal trip saved by the riot and some nice French wineDuncan Hogg 
N => The Only Room in Town Turned Out to Be Just Fine My husband and I rarely book hotels in advance when we travel because we like to keep a loose itinerary  We do though make up a list of about  local hotels in priority order and call them one by one when we arrive in town  This plan has never backfired on us EXCEPT when we stayed in Montreal  We had the unfortunate timing of arriving during Pierre Trudeaus funeral which was being held there and everything was sold out that we tried  Desperate I asked for a recommendation from the last place I called about who might have a room left  I was advised to call Hotel de LInstitut  Between its quotlast to be picked for the teamquot status and its role in training hospitality students you can imagine that my expectations were low when we arrived at the hotel Turns out it was a perfectly pleasant experience  The room was clean nicely appointed and sunny  The hotel is elegant the service was good and we didnt even get gouged for our dilemna about  per night if memory serves  I would stay there again   even if there are other rooms available next time 
N => Great hotel Phenomenal staff Good accommodations in an excellent location for a reasonable price  Comfortable spacious rooms were exactly the home base we needed to explore the city and nightlife  Breakfast included from the Bistro was a nice plus  When our car got broken into recommend paying a little extra to park in the hotels garage instead of street parking the hotel staff could not have been more helpful  Paul came to the rescue of these three American travelers and helped us deal with the difficult situation from every angle    always exceedingly gracious  Recommend Hotel De Paris to any travelers visiting Montreal  Well definitely stay here the next time we visit 
N => Things NOT to do in Montreal   stay at Hotel de Paris When arriving and looking at the Hotel you might think that it looks like a nice little Hotel to stay in while in Montreal  When leaving you will think     never again Ok first up the setting  We were a small group in the age group of  to  and well slightly over the age of finding it exciting to backpack and stay in dilapidated hostels because thats exactly what this is just for a higher price  And also I can see that they apparently have a youth hostel part aswell but we stayed in what is referred to as the quothotelquot part of Hotel de Paris  So this review does not concern the quothostelauberge de jeunessequot We paid up front for two days I guess the alarm bells should have been ringing already there as when do you ever pay the stay up front other than in a place where they are used to having people run from the bill Anyway once in the entrance you start getting the feel of the place  The entrance was being reated so it was dirty had a makeshift congierge desk and didnt look very inviting  The receptionist was reasonably friendly but overall seemed rather uninterrested We then got to our rooms small was the first impression the bed was just hard and small and short there was a linen and another sheet to keep us warm thank god we did not come in the winter furniture was generally just old and in places falling to pieces  Tiny television from the early s tiny bathroom again everything just kind of seemed like it was falling apart  The walls had been partly painted in places and still looked like a work in progress the curtains were kept on the window with some home made fittings  It was just not very inviting and when you look around you start thinking that you will do your best to spend as little time as possible in the room Then closer look dirt on the window sill dirt in every corner dust chewing gum under the desk etc  Basically once you finally arrive home the first thing you do is to put all clothes and material that has been in contact with the room into the washer The atmosphere well mainly young people were staying in the hotel  This just meant that it was loud people running around the corridors screaming and it also smellt of ijuana for a large part of a rainy saturday  The walls are paper thin as well so we had to listen to our neighbours have sex    several times which again just added to an already unpleasant experience  The only reason we actually stayed the two nights was part laziness and part the fact that we were not planning to be in the Hotel except for a quick sleep  And to be honest when you are in a hotel like this sleep is not exaclty what you feel like either Now some might think well this sounds like the place to stay for backpackers and again I would have to say no as this place costs  CAD per person per night  An incredible price for such a place  Had this place cost under  CAD per ROOM per night I might have been able to accept the quality but for that price I expected so much more And then of course breakfast is included    on their website which by the way looks very nice httpwww hotel montreal com they state that the quotcontinental breakfastquot is included  Their continental breakfast is  coffeetea  croissant  orange juice  Dont expect jams or chocolate spread or any ham or cheese etc  Fair dues the croissant was good it was still an overall dissappointing experience  The bistro is as also the hotel quite dilapidated Any positives Yes the location isnt half bad      minute walking distance to downtown depending on your speed So overall this place just seems to be run by people who have no particular interest to be in the hotelling business or potentially they just dont have a clue  It looks like a place thats there to take whatever money it can get without paying any particular attention to making the customer happy or having return business because I cannot see how anyone would want to return quite frankly  One thing is to have an old mansion at your disposal but then making this out of it Clueless  And if you want to get anywhere in the business the least you can do is keep the rooms clean  To be honest looking at the house there is potential it just needs someone who cares and who knows a thing of two about reation because whatever is in there should just be torn down to start anew  
N => Worst Hotel Experience of All Time Awful experience at Hotel de Paris Montreal  Hotel is divided between two buildings on either side of Sherbrooke Street  This is quite inconvenient as I will explain  Please read my review of this horrible place The towels were frayed thin small  The bed sheets were thread bare and see through  No extra blankets  No shampoo or conditioner lotion as is custoy at most hotels  No clock tv was very small shower curtain was too small for the shower opening water all over because of this  Shower curtain rod was a tension rod that slipped down the shower walls and fell down with every shower taken Bed was old creeky extremely poor quality mattress  Lamp and room lighting was poor  Large wooden window shutters instead of curtains or blinds were difficult and cumbersome and allowed in full view from the street or zero  Room did not have a coffee machine and breakfast voucher from cafe was a rip  If you want to take your bagel and coffee from the cafe to go you are forced to pay extra to do so for each breakfast  When questioned why they were hard pressed to provide an answer The room was not supplied with kleenex tissues and had only one roll of toilet paper  I had to cross the street and ask for another The closet and room in general was small  Bathroom was miniscule It looks like they tried to spend money on the finishes  The washroom had nice tiles and the shower looked nice  However the taps made this extremely high pitched loud sound when the shower was running  It sounded like a fire alarm going off and nothing we adjusted could make the sound dissipate  They should have spent the money on details like this instead of pretty tiles I woke up to the smell of cigarette smoke on Saturday morning  When I spoke to the front desk about it they said that no one was smoking in the rooms  Im not sure how they could know that for sure from across the street  No one offered to look into it or follow up with me  Customer service lacking I cant think of one thing that was positive about this experience  All around it was the WORST HOTEL I have ever stayed at  I would not recommend it to my worst enemy  Go elsewhere and be glad you did  
N => good times We liked this hotel  We are a group of students from Vermont and dint want to stay at a Holiday Inn  Very nice building at least  years old  Rooms were large although they told us they had small budget rooms too  All in all a very good location quiet but close to all the restaurants and nightlife downtown  Helpful front sesk sent us to Prince Arthur Street for supper and took time ro explain how to get around  
N => escellente lugar I like dis hotel  Lovely to walk near here  Nice vista from balcony en frente  Workers almost all know to speak spanich  Freidly lugar  Linda edifidio   Yessee Costa Rica 
N => Stay Away     Stay Away     Dont Do It Well lets just say we paid for a room and never slept     we were given a key to room    that is the size of a closet door that lead up to a attic that had two double size matress laying on a floor in each side of the room and had two double size beds that were in the middle of the room   toilet seat falling off   no soap to watch your hands and none of the lamps work    as I can see they dont send anyone up to the attic to clean     if there was a fire our whole family would be dead   as this is a very scary and awful room to be put in without any source of escaping   We called numberous of time to find out if our parking stale was reserved and told yes twice to find out that one of the parking stale the worker at the time had no idea      If anyone stayed here recently obiviously didnt have the luck we had  For anyone going to stay good luck hopefully you will have better luck  This is a three star room rated by the hotel 
N => So nice This hotel was very wonderful  The workers there were very pleasant  The hotel was very clean the rooms were large and the price was not expensive  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => This hotel is a total scam go elsewhere I made a reservation with the hotel through their website for one night  y   My sister made a arate reservation for a  star superior room for herself and her fiance for the same days  We both received e mail confirmations  The day before we were expected to arrive I received a phone call from the desk confirming a room upgrade to a  star superior room I had made several weeks earlier  The man asked what time to expect my arrival and I stated that I will be arriving in the evening  He confimed everything and I assumed everything would go according to plan  When we arrived at the hotel we stated at the desk that we had reservations to which the young man at the desk asked quotIf we had brought our own sheetsquot  Bewildered we said quotNoquot to which the man responded that it would be quot per night for sheets quot My sister then asked quotIs this a hotelquot The man stammered and said quotYesquot and then proceeded to shuffle through a batch of receipts from individuals that had checked in  Then he said that he couldnt find our reservations based on these receipts  Neither of us could figure out why he didnt simply check the computer in front of him for our reservations  And how is it that I received a phone call from the hotel confirming my reservation the day before The man said that the individual in question didnt know what he was talking about  We insisted that since he lost both our reservations An unlikely coincidence that he do us the courtesy of find us rooms  He insisted there was no space at the hotel  Strange considering that  min  prior he was willing to offer us a room albeit with their hostel annex  He sent us to a shabby motel saying that they had two rooms available  They did not  We went back fuming  Finally they made arrangements at a Best Western more expensive using my contact information mysteriously made available from the computer  How is it that our reservations were lost when he was able to pull my name from the hotel computer We spoke with the Hotel de Paris manager Hector Zana on the phone who said that the hotel would pick up the difference in the room rates when we checked out the following day  However when we called the manager he was extremely rude and denied ever having the conversation or offering to pick up the difference in our tabs  We promptly called the police which got the same rude response from the manager  Whats worse the manager said that we made the reservation through a non affiliated website  a blatant lie as the hotel had sent us e mail confirmations when we made the reservations  So here we were stuck paying  more after spending hours arguing with these people  Plus we had to call our credit cards making sure that we were charged for the missed reservations as our accounts on the hotels website were still active  Our theory that there are no such  star rooms and when the hotel realized thats what we were expecting conveniently lost  erate reservations and bamboozled us by promising to cover the extra expense of costlier rooms elsewhere  Despite their nice website this is not a true hotel but a hostel run by a bunch of con artists  
N => Disappointed I was quite disappointed when I got to my room  I had high expectations due to all of the good reviews this place was receiving  I rented a standard  double bedroom suite  There were holes in the walls loose tiles in the washroom mold on the walls in the washroom not enough towels     the only good thing about this hotel was the customer service  The people at the desk were friendly and gave us information regarding places to visitgo in montreal  overall very disappointed  
N => Room in Hotel De Paris They charge you firstnight then show you the aweful room  Then they say if you want a better room you have to pay moreif you want to leave you have to pay for first night It is rip off businessgoing on this hotel It was very bad  They have ruined PARISs name a guest for two nights   
N => Good hotel if you get the big room I went to Hotel de Paris a couple of years ago but I had such a fun experience why not write a review now I went with three friends so we either got a deluxe room or a suite  I wish I remember the room number the room was a great value  There was a spiral staircase leading up to the attic room huge room with two corners that had slanted ceilings four full size beds we were only expecting two and a full kitchen dining table and bathroom The location is great too  Close to all  we walked everywhere even tofrom the Greyhound station  We got there early and they let us wait in a standard room until our room was ready  That room was pretty mediocre but not terrible  Just motel ish The place is nothing fancy and dont expect much service but I can at least vouch for the big rooms and privacy Ask for the attic room with four beds if you wanna have fun with friends   
N => Dirty  
N => Just STAY AWAY  
N => Bad  
N => Just a rip off  
N => Good location friendly staff  During my stay my room  which was cosy was cleaned everyday unless I asked them not to  We were offered a free continental breakfast on the weekend and the staff was very warm and made sure we were comfortable  The location was fantastic we were walking distance for shopping and transportation was never hard to find when we needed it  Although it was a  star hotel our service was better than a  star hotel  We had free internet and a mini fridge in our room  The  star hotels I have stayed in before alwalys have a fee for access of both these items  I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone staying in downtown Montreal 
N => Huge disappointment Dorion is easily the worst hotel I have stayed at  The last two days of my stay they did not clean my room  Though they did service the room the first few days they did not vacuum  Other problems included cheap furniture thin walls and doors smoke smell in common areas hotel laundry visible to customers and most staff does not appear to be trained in the hotel industry  Hotelling is about service  Dorion seems to have missed that  I can forgive a lot but not cleaning the room is just not right  Only half the staff were friendly the other half did not even respond to a friendly quotBon Jour quot 
N => ent price friendly staff European  star hotel I did extensive research and waited until the last minute to book something because I wanted to see if I could get a good last minute deal  I could have stayed at other locations for cheaper but ided to stay at the Hotel Dorion because of the review before this one The Good The staff was extremely friendly  My other only experience with lodging in Montreal was at a BampB and the owner was not as friendly as the staff at the Dorion  Also the location was literally across the street from the Metro and there was almost no noise coming from the strip club under the hotel even though my window was directly above the club The Bad The room we stayed in needed serious work the sheets had cigarette burn holes in them and the bathroom room was boarded up  We did not ask to be moved to a different room because we knew the hotel was probably full of similar type rooms  Also despite the fact that there were no smoking signs all around the hotel two staff members smoked while they were working inside the hotel This hotel is a European type  Star hotel you have to have traveled in Europe to know what Im talking about  I gave the hotel a  star only because the staff was friendlier than most  star hotel staff but really the hotel is  star quality  
N => Plus jamais  
N => Highly recommend Hotel staff was very courteous amp helpful  Room was clean large amp had a beautiful view  Kitchenette was clean amp very appreciated  In room safe was a great feature  Location was close enough to some sites amp very accessible by Metro for farther sights  I will stay here again amp recommend it highly  After staying at a horrible hotel in Ottawa on the same trip Hotel Du Fort was refreshing  
N => Better than we had hoped for Wife and I stayed at the Du Fort for  nights y    We got in very late via train from Niagara Falls so didnt get to see the area till the next morning Check in was great the room was a very unexpected surprise  Nice and roomygreat bath amenities and the little kitchenette area was very useful  The view was ok  If we looked to the left we had a view of Mount Royal Park and to the right  we could see a little of the water  We didnt come for views from our room  It was our first visit to Montreal so out the door we went  We were always greeted warmly by all the staff Riza  almost was hurt if we didnt let her clean our room  We had put the quotdo not deturb sign out one day  She almost insisted we allow her to clean it  She always made sure we had plenty of amenities in room  Thank you Riza You have to choices for the subway  Atwater or Guy Concordia  The walk to Atwater is a little more depressing  but they do have some great shopping and food courts  But the food court we liked even more was Faubourg on St Catherine about   blocks from the Du Fort  They had food from around the world   Chinese JapaneseItalian Indian Thai  Sandwich shops  Lebanese  Samirs is great  There were a few others that escape my mind  One of our favorites was Saint Cinnamon on the lower floor  The egg croissant sandwich is bigtasty and a great buy  Very filling  kept us going through the day till we found where we might want to eat Beer is very expensive all over in barsrestaurants  You can buy at the stores that sell to take back to your room at a better cost  But we did come across Brutopia com about   blocks east of hotel  There beers were Can per pint during there happy hour and a generous happy hour it was   every night It was our first trip to Montreal and it was a fantastic one starting with the Hotel Du Fort Thank you for everything  
N => Trouble from the start       We booked our hotel online with a great rate or so we thought  I wanted to spend a wonderful weekend in Montreal for Thanksgiving and all we had from the hotel was trouble from the day we booked  They charged our credit card  times over   for four nights at one point we never had any credit left on our card because the hotel didnt want to stop charging us  When we thought we had it all fixed a month after our return home we were charged again  But this time we were on another trip a cruise and tried to rent a car and our credit card got lined because the Hotel du fort charged our card yet again I wouldnt deal with this hotel again if it were the last hotel in Montreal 
N => Reasonably priced in a good location Our room was on the th floor at the back of the hotel with a fantastic view over the city especially magical when we returned at night  We had booked a classic room for our  night stay but it was really spacious  We opened a set of double doors expecting it to be another wardrobe and to our delight discovered a kitchenette with coffeetea maker microwave fridge sink and cupboard space   ideal if you wanted to eat a meal in the room  There was a small table and chairs by the window which made it more comfortable  We only made use of this facility once for breakfast but it was useful to have  N B  You have to ask on Reception for cutlery  The staff were friendly and helpful when it came to providing city and metro maps  Although the location was near to shops and restaurants the rue du Fort itself was not at all noisy  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Bonaventure metro station and a very short and reasonably priced taxi ride to the VIA rail station where we took the train to Quebec City  
N => Thoroughly Enjoable Stay To celebrate my wifes birthday we ided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal and booked our stay at the Hotel du Fort This was our first stay at this particular hotel and we were most happy with our choice  The staff from the Front Desk person to the housekeepers we met each morning in the hallways were always quick with a warm smile and a hello and made us feel very welcomed  Our room while not the largest weve stayed in was clean modern and well equipped We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel du Fort and would not hesitate to recommend this particular inn to other travellers  
N => Great Staff   Good Enough Stay The concierge staff were very friendly and helpful amp the room was your average hotel room  We had some problems with the plumbing amp were not impressed that our room was entered without permission to deal with it  We didnt realize there was a problem yet  We had stepped out for lunch amp were surprised to see the lights shut off amp a note waiting to advice us of the entry  I had let me guard down amp left a lot of cash on the table  None of it was taken it just left me a little uncomfortable If I had to do it again Id consider the hotel because the rate is reasonable but I might book a different hotel to be a few blocks further down St Catherines Otherwise I dont see much wrong with this place  
N => A great find just a bit out of the way A great hotel with efficient service and reasonable rates  I loved the spacious rooms well thought of touches like wine glasses dishes and utensils and an extra half bath in the premium king suite  Overall it was a great experience in a very clean room providing everything one could want in a not luxury but close to luxury hotel  The room was a tad bland and there was not alot of character in the or but it is Montreal and everything we were there to enjoy was not in the hotel room  A wonderful city that I will continue to visit every year for the best shopping dining and fun in the Village that can be had in Canada  
N => ent price ent room We stayed for  nights at Hotel Du Fort and had an okay time  We were using the hotel as a launching point for day trips throughout Montreal but there didnt seem to be much going on near the hotel  It was very expensive overnight parking and we should have included that in our hotel price The hotel was very clean and comfortable but also very outdated in furnishings  The room or was clearly worn but again very clean  A desk station coffeetable and  chairs plus a mirror vanity in addition to the bed and bathroom  Pretty spacious just not what we were expecting  
N => Classy gem in west section of downtown Montreal We arrived too early to check in but our luggage was kept safe by the helpful clerk in a locked room so we could enjoy our Montreal adventure right away  No sooner had I been waiting for our car to be parked by my traveling companion did the concierge strike up a conversation with me inquiring about my hometown and then exchanging playful banter about our CFL teams  Sean was great and very knowledgeable   he had us hooked up with a tour departing from our hotel in just an hours time recommended restaurants for lunch and attractions in the area  After our tour we returned to the hotel and checked in properly  Our room on the th floor had a lovely view of downtown  It was a very generous size and was c lean and comfortable  The only downside was that we were located right in the middle of the corridor so that we could hear a lot of elevator traffic and more particularly the ice machine going sometimes late at night  Otherwise it was very quiet and the staff were wonderful  Everyone was fully bilingual so there were no problems with the staff not understanding English  Being located where it was we had a quick and easy escape from the downtown towards Toronto on the morning of our departure as it is right up the street from a highway exit  It is also near to the Metro so we were able to catch a bus to the Oratory and the Metro down to Vieux Montreal on a  tourist STM pass  Well worth it to not have to worry about parking and driving in Montreal I would definitely stay here again  
N => Great Hotel for the price We stayed at Hotel Du Fort for three nights and found everything just wonderful  The staff was great they were super friendly and went out of their way to be helpful The room was extremely clean Everyday we came back to a super clean room  The location was great just a little walk from the main attractions but we liked it that way  Our room was on the th floor and it was exceptionally quiet The microwave and refrigerator was great it helped save us some money  The morming coffe and tea was a bonus  We didnt eat at the hotel so we cant comment on that  We will definitely stay here again  This is the first review I ever wrote but we liked it so much Id like to pass the compliments along We thought it was a great Hotel for the price  
N => A great find in Montreal Only able to stay in Montreal one night we considered ourselves so lucky to have booked the Hotel du Fort  The hotel and its employees exceeded our expectations  We had a huge clean corner room with fantastic views  The genial helpful staff helped us take advantage of the hotels great location 
N => Would certainly stay again Very Comfortable room   not really modern  Right downtown close to everything shopping Movie Theatre amp Bell CentreConvenient underground safe parking 
N => Amazing This place was a great place to stay My boyfriend and I went to Montreal for our first time and stayed at Hotel du Fort  From the first moment we got there until we left we didnt have a single issue  We arrived earlier than our room was ready so the concierge stored our luggage while we walked around Rue Ste  Catherine  The hotel was in the perfect spot and we had a nice view of Downtown Montreal  The metro was a   minute walk on a very cold day  We walked to the Atwater station though Guy Concordia is close as well  Every single staff member was nice and helpful  There was one concierge I wish I knew his name that helped us find the best night spots restaurants and happenings around the city  The rooms were lovely and comfortable  Given the chance I will stay in Hotel du Fort the next trip I make to Montreal  I wont go anywhere else  
N => Good Accomo for a family Not a bad place to stay Good NIce sized room  Quiet  Friendly staffBad At the far western edge of the downtown district  Needs a bit of updating  
N => Wont go back When we arrived we were told that our room wasnt available as the previous people had not vacated it  When we explained we had a reservation that we had made several months previously it was our honeymoon we were told there was nothing that they could do  We stood and argued for approximately  minutes and finally were given a room  Horrible experience  The room was nice enough but I wouldnt risk getting told they wouldnt honour our reservation again  We wont go back  
N => Never stay here If you make a reservation at the Hotel Du Fort you run the risk of having it refused when you arrive I would never recommend to anyone that they should stay at this hotel We had a reservation during the Montreal Just for Lhs festival  During this time in Montreal it is notoriously difficult to get accomodations so we reserved our stay at the Du Fort two weeks in advance  We received a confirmation number and we were looking forward to a pleasent stay based on the reviews on this website When we arrived they told us they did not have our reservation We showed them the receipt and confirmation number and they claimed that they never received it from their hotel chain management  They refused us accomodations because they said they were fully booked and they could not find us alternative accomodations because the whole city was fully booked  We had to impose on an aquaintance of ours and sleep on a couch Compounding this they billed my credit card for the night  It has been a month since this and I have still not seen a refund for this amount I would suggest to anyone looking to stay at this hotel that they make arrangements elsewhere  There is no excuse for not honoring a booked reservation  Weve contacted the hotel chain management and they said that the hotel definitely received the reservation but most likely ided to bump us because another guest wished to extend their stay an additional night at a higher rate This is completely inexcusable  I write this review so that others will hopefully read it before booking a reservation that  not be honored Again if you make a reservation at the Hotel Du Fort you run the risk of having it refused when you arrive  
N => Just OK This hotel was OK but nothing to get over enthusiatic about  It is not in the best location being a fair distance from the old town  The neighborhood is a little off putting when you first see it   but it is fine just quotwell lived inquot  The restaurant   Le Paris   recommended by the hotel staff is about a block away and is great  The rooms are fine but nothing exciting  No Internet access was available  The staff are fine and helpful  However it appears that most people checking into this hotel get coupons for the continental breakfast wheras we did not this caused quite a stir when we appeared at breakfast even though a price for breakfast is posted and it can be charged to your room  By the way the breakfast was not that good  The metro station is about  blocks away but with a family of  it was just as cheap to take a taxi to the old town rather than taking the metro with  changes  cost about  by taxi or  x   by metro  The price was relaively low and with that in mind this hotel was probably not a bad deal although I would look elsewhere if I returned to Montreal 
N => great stayhighly recommend this place  
N => fantastic room value   
N => good hotel  
N => Horrific Experience Please dont waste your time This hotel is grimy outdated and I have never witnessed worse customer service anywhere else  When my friends and I arrived at the hotel we were quotgreetedquot by an irritated old man behind the desk who after giving us a round of dirty looks refused to honor our reservation because the price we booked on Booking com was quottoo lowquot  He told us we had to pay a higher price or get out  Obviously we chose to go somewhere else rather than we treated with such blatant contempt  We ended up down the street at Auberge Montreal which was much cleaner and the customer service was great  Even though we ended up at a much better hotel the experience left my friends and I with a really bad impression so try and avoid this place at all cost Not only was the customer service horrific but it is illegal for hotels to try and raise the price that was already booked online  
N => Would love to throw eggs at this place The worst customer service Ive ever encounteredMan at check in refused to honor our reservation at the price we booked online  Insisted we pay more or go to another hotel  When we told him we would only pay what we booked online he proceeded to call the online booking company to yell and complain  All the while he lost several customers who arrived and quickly left after overhearing and witnessing this disgruntled man yelling over the phoneIve never felt so unwelcome in my life  So basically we were kicked out and had to look for another hotel  We ended up staying at Auberge Montreal Espace Confort just up the street  Very cute and friendly service  
N => Not bad My boyfriend and I chose to stay here for our last night in Montreal because the first place we stayed in was just awful The location is ideal for young adults who want to be close to the nightlife  We asked to see the room first before booking it to make sure it was better than where we were staying  The room is very basic  It has a comfortable double bed shower no tub  inch TV with basic cable and a small fridge for bottled water etc  The room was clean  A small breakfast was also included one orange juice or coffee with one croissant  Most of all the price was only  a night taxes included The downside was that it was a long and steep walk up  flights of stairs to get to our room and we had to carry our luggage ourselves  The room looks outdated and you cant control its temperature  The hallways are very narrow  The rooms are not quotsoundproof quot Despite all this it is worth it Keep in mind youre only spending about  per night  
N => Never again Bad bad choice The hotel is horroble No air conditioning in our room floor and the place smells like vomit We didnt spent the  nights that weve paid so I want my money backPlease take this hotel out of your list  Not recommended even for enemies 
N => Credit Card Scam   Beware When I went to Montreal   I used my credit card ONLY to book a room at this hotel  A few weeks later I was called by my credit card company informing me that someone in Montreal had maxed out my credit card  Since I did not use my credit card anywhere else during my stay at Montreal I can only suspect that someone working at the Hotel de Manoir St  Denis used my account number  Furthermore watch what happens to your credit card when you submitted it on arrival  I didnt realize it then but they made a copy of my card  If you are making reservations at this hotel beware of the possible fraud and tampering with your credit card  
N => Dont expect  star service but    I stayed at the hotel for  nights in ember and was not disappointed considering the room rate of  CAN  The room was compact but as I was out and about all day it suited the purpose of a nights sleep  The room was heated at a comfortable temperature bed was comfy water was hot and room was clean  The only down side would be that the rooms are not very sound proof so this  be testing in peak season but other than that I dont have any complaints and would recommend the hotel if you are just wanting a bed for the night or two  
N => Do NOT go there  Bed bugs We were eaten alive by bed bugs  Bitten all over the body  Appalling  My wife had to return to Sydney  The management denied everything and were rude  The place is disgustingly filthy  Whatever you do   DO NOT GO THERE We have informed the Montreal Health Authority but they diodnt seem to care   never replied  
N => Would not stay here again   at any price The only good thing I can say about this hotel is the price and the fact that its available even in high seasons We booked our reservation  weeks prior to arriving   but they had no records of it when we got there  Luckily they did have rooms available so we were okay in that respect Our room was extremely small and not properly ventilated therefore giving it a mildew oder  There were gums stuck to the ceiling and stains on the carpeted floor The only good thing I can say about this place is that it was relatively cheap but not a good value since do you get what you pay for here and the staff was cordial and polite  
N => so so It is a place to go not for pleasure  Small not too comfortable but close to everything  Seems to be clean even thou some soap left in the sink  Nice breakfast coffee croissant tea fruit spread was the best butter toast orange juice  Not too friendly staff  
N => Good place to crash   dont expect much I stayed there with my boyfriend after a concert at the Bell Centre  Its basically a good place to crash after a night of partying  ROOM The room was small and not fashionable orated but seemed clean  The TV remote worked but we had to pay a deposit to use it  Bathroom was tiny  There was soap left in the sink from the previous guest SERVICE Interacted with  people  receptionists  cleaning person and none were friendly  Gawked at you for asking for any service SECURITY You receive  keys   one for the room and one for the front door which is locked after  pm  The front door key did not work and we had to enter through the back door which was wide open  Im surprised there arent homeless people sleeping in the common areas  The next day the receptionist was adamant that the key should have worked PARKING Paid   even though website says   
N => Very Interesting Stay Well when we arrived there was glass on the ground from car break ins  There were break ins during our stay  We parked where the staff told us to park so that  have helped with our car not being broken into  We were on a floor with loud college students  I think it was the size of the rooms that made it seem that they were louder than they really were  The most exciting part during our stay there was a police scene right under our window  Apparently one of the guest at this hotel car was broken into and he saw it happening and called the police  That was interesting to watch  This place does have a continental breakfast which I cannot complain about at all  The croissants were delish with a nice glass of orange juice to wash it down  I found the staff to be very helpful and we were able to exchange our money there  
N => Nice little hotel After taking a day trip to MTL from Ottawa my girlfriend and I ided that we wanted to turn it into an overnight trip  After phoning a few hotel we struck gold when the Hotel du eau Forum said they had room  And it was only  for the night  Once we arrived we were a little skeptical due to the outside appearance as well as the location of the hotel  We had nothing to worry about  Clean rooms friendly staff and a wee breakfast in the morning  The rooms are a little small but do you go to stay in your room or see the sights If you were staying for more than  or  nights then you  want a larger room  
N => This hotel has a bedbug epidemic DO NOT STAY AT THE HOTEL DU NOUVEAU FORUMMy husband and I stayed there last weekend and woke up with bugs in the bed  We did not think much of it just that it was disgusting and we returned to the states One week later we are COVERED in red blistery bug bites  I have over  on my body  I went to the Dor and he told me that they were bedbug bites and that they take up to  days to erupt out of your skin and then will continue to blister for up to  more days  They are horrible and painful and feverish  You can contract Hepatitis B from the bites  I have contacted the hotel the Canadian Dept  of Heath AND the Montreal tourism board but I want to make as many people aware of this problem as possible  The hotel itself did not seem dirty or anything so CHECK YOUR MATRESSES wherever you stay I do not want anyone else to suffer as we are  It is horrible  
N => great place to stay very clean very safe  everything a cleansafe friendly good service close to bus depot and main subway station  laundry closeby good resturants minutes away  
N => Not Awful We paid less than we would for a hostel  The room was fine nothing special but we paid less than  dollars a night between us and you get a pastry and a cup of coffee in the morning 
N => not too bad really We stayed here after our reservations were lost at Celebrities hotel on St  Denis  At first we were not too happy about the location but it was right up the street from a St Catharines  great shopping food bars on this street   We were  minutes  walking from Old Montreal and about  minutes from any shopping malls and restaurants  we didnt have much of a view due to the construction going on but my room was clean and the staff was very pleasant  You do have to buzz in after  p m  Sophie was working when we arrived and she helped us find a great place to relax and unwind after our slightly upsetting start to our vacation  it was called the Les  Brasseurs  the three brothers  Breakfast was not fantastic croissants muffins coffee and juice but not horrible either  some cereal or fresh fruit would have been great  all in all we got what we paid for  
N => The worst that I ever stayed at    This is the crapiest and dirtiest place I dont even want to mention the word hotel I ever stayed  The room and corridor was pot and smoke smell dirty and stinky  The bed was rough and hair on the sheets  The worst was the next morning no hot water and the explanation was the crapiest  I think the hotel is owned by Indian people family business and even the staff was bad  The bad part was when we enter the reception a guy looks like a homeless was asking for roomno joke he was that dirty and the receptionist told that they were full it seems that the hotel is mostly occupied by these types of people but personally I was wondering if they can afford even that cheap priceIn any case I recommend anyone to avoid this place in any means unless like I said if you are a person can accept the pot smell and other dirty things  We had to wash all the clothes including our bags when we reach home because the smell stayed Im not joking and I had enough trouble with my wife for booking this room Lesson learned in a hard way 
N => Dirty Bathroom We booked the Hotel on Hotwire com and having used the website several times before with good results was not at all worried untill we arrived Hotel Elegant was not elegant at all  Our bathroom was filthy scum all around the sink the toilet was covered in pubic hair and dirt it clearly hadnt been cleaned properly for some time  And the bathtub was stained with dirt The room had no heating which in winter is not great the room was really cold We are currently backpacking around the world on a budget so our standards are not that high with regards to accomadation but how hard is it to clean a toilet  
N => Never Again  On the way back to Toronto  coming from Qu bec we stayed one night in Hotel Elegant in Montr al  Despite we had read some positive reviews o this hotel prior to book we were very badly impressed by this Hotel that is not at all quotElegantquot like its name  At the front Desk we had the sensation having disturbed the guy who was quotworkingquot on Internet The darkness of the corridors leading to the rooms looked like those of a Hospital and the quotgrey doorsquot had something disquieting  The room was very basic  and the bathroom was dirty  We found some papers under the wash basin and the most disgusting were some blood traces on the hair drier itself on the wall were the hair drier was located and on the hair dried cable   We assumed someone had successfully tried to kill mosquitoes  To conclude our experience in this Hotel we asked the front desk guy if it was possible to have breakfast around  a m  since we had to leave early to Toronto but the guy answered this was not possible before  a m      not even a cup of coffee  We were therefore obliged to stop later at a Motel on the road despite we had breakfast included in the rate we paid   
N => budget hotel We originally booked another hotel which ended up having an emergency plumbing issue so the staff booked in this place which was slightly more expensive  The hotel I originally picked was cheap and kinda cute  This new place was across from the Greyhound bus station and Metro and more on a busy street  I liked Saint Denis street better  The rooms were sort of like the Days Inn with minimal furniture hard bed and a smoking room  We were advised by the staff that parking on the street could be done plenty of spots but not to leave anything visible  That implied statement made me sort of wonder about the neighborhood but being with two other girls and near the Metro stop we had a blast and made it work  I am sorry I had to pay  a night but we werent there that long to really have to stare at it  The staff was pretty nice and knew English  The room was clean and not complicated and everything worked  If you want a budget hotel this would be fine but dont expect to be waited on like the Fairmont  
N => Pleasant stay The Hotel Elegant gave me everything I needed and expected for my recent trip to Montreal  Compared to other budget hotels in the Latin Quarter area I was pleased that I was able to wheel my luggage right up and through the front door and then take an elevator up to my th floor room  Having air conditioning in my room was also essential however it would have been nice to have control over it  There were times when it was either too cold or had turned off and we were forced to accept whatever it offered  Having internet access was extremely useful  This room didnt have wireless acess so fortunately they lend out internet cables  The outlet however is by the phone which is on the nightstand  So forget working at the little table while sitting in a chair unless you bring your own really long cord  Youll also need to bring your own way of telling the time as they dont provide any kind of clock  But I did get a room with a little refrigerator which was pretty handy  Now I just wish they get around to acquiring coffee makers and be microwave ovens as we had no way of making anything hot to eat  While they offer a continental breakfast it is served from  am to  am and we always had to leave by  each morning The beds are on the too firm side and the room is not well lit but the bedding is fine and we had no problems with noisy neighbors perhaps because the hotel wasnt full  The main switch controls wall mounted lights over each bed and you cant opt to have one of them off  Then the little bedside lamps are not much better than night lights  This leaves the dresser side of the room pretty dark at night Since the hotel was newly constructed everything is clean and functions well  There was a hairdryer in the bathroom  At the time of our stay there was a major construction project across the street with a fancy new building going up  Its not pretty right now but there is nothing about this section of the street Rue St Hubert that Id call quotsketchyquot as per another review  Our walk out to the nearby Berri UQAM metro station or area shopping and restaurants was just fine at all times of the day  OK there are panhandlers in the neighborhood but theyre everywhere else in Montreal as well  And Rue Ste Catherine heading east from St Hubert happens to be the heart of the gay neighborhood so there were couples and singles cruising for action  But you dont have to walk that way if youre just headed to the metro  Since Berri UQAM is a main hub station we had easy access to both the orange and green lines that got us everywhere we wanted to go in just a few short stops The service was great  We were able to check in early  And then for our departure they handled ordering a taxi for us the night before and the taxi was right on time  In all the Hotel Elegant provided a comfortable and care free place to stay at a low price  
N => Personnel rude et pas respectueux ca ma choquee  
N => I saw a mouse in my room The hotel has no frills  The guy at reception was not very friendly  The room was small  Everything look old but clean  The TV was at least  years old with only  or  channels  There was only  light bulbs on the ceiling  The ceiling fan was noisy and the street is loud if you want to open the  windows  The first night I was reading n the bed when I saw a mouse coming from under the door  I dont recommend this hotel  Even if it is not expensive it doesnt worth it  
N => WORST HOTEL EVER   IT HAD BED BUGS I have travelled extensively in the last year and this was my worst hotelhostel experience so far  The room looked okay until I woke up in the morning itching and looked down to find a bed crawling with bed bugs We tried to tell the person at the front desk whom I am assuming first language was French but they didnt seem to understand  Also we didnt feel entriely safe in the neighbourhoodblock it is located in  All night you could here ppl  from the bar below yelled at one other and a few fights  
N => Worst Place ive ever seen This is the dirtiest hotel ive ever seen and im not a picky person by anymeans  Drug addicts all over the place and prostitutes all over  i was asked to buy drugs before i even checked in  the staff is in on the stuff goin on in side as i saw them goin in and out of rooms at all hours  you share a bathroom and shower its just gross  the staff was incredable rude wouldnt even let u finish a sentene without inturupting  tried to charge five dollars for an extra key  the rooms were filthy cigarette stains all over the sing no phone tv didnt work the beds were  inches apart no space to walk around  
N => Not the greatest experience Using Orbitz in e I made our reservation for the end of y  My credit card was immediately charged one night by the hotel  I found that strange and figured out what happened as I checked into the hotel  The employee named Johnny and I figured out that the hotel mistakenly assumed my reservation was for e  They assumed we were a no show  Thus they charged me that night  Luckily I had printed out a copy of the orbitz reservation as that was the only proof I had that the hotel made the mistake Johnny printed out a receipt and explained that at that moment of our actual check in I would be refunded the money wrongly charged in e and would be charged the entire amount of our stay  I finally got my refund for that incorrect initial charge  only after I filed a claim with my credit card company and emailed the hotel saying it was long after my stay and I never was given the refund to which I was entitled  It proved worth it to keep the paper trailI didnt think the hotel was in the worst area  I felt it was safe at night to walk around  It was just very noisy The Berri Uqam subway stop was a convenient few steps away  You can easily cut through the Couche Tard mini t located very close to the hotelOur room was cramped  Barely enough room between the beds and anything nearby  The whimpy ceiling fan was more a noise nuisance and didnt cool us off at all  And the room temperature climbed very high on the hot summer nights The one small window could be opened but there was barely any breeze and the noise from the streets below would wake the dead  especially on a weekendThe shared bathrooms were always unoccupied when needed  Footwear flip flops etc  highly recommended while showering  Neither the towels nor the linens were changed at all during the few days of our stay  The linen closet across from our room was left openedunlocked for the first two days of our stay so we thought we were supposed to help ourselves  and that we did Would I stay here again be  If I did though I would bring a big fan or three in the back of our car so we could be cooled off at night  And most importantly I would again make the reservation via something like Orbitz for the visible fact that their records dont seem to be well organized  I mean   imagine if we arrived and there were no rooms for us since they had incorrectly assumed our stay was for e See my pictures and make sure youre prepared to sacrifice some comfort  since youre most likely trying to save money by staying here like us  
N => Not bad   Not bad at all  Hotel Eureka is not in the safest part of Montreal but it is in a very convenient location  My friend and I stayed in Hotel Eureka for  nights and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go shopping food bus caf  club and no taxi was needed Upon entering the Hotel the scene is quite like a small town house with many very steep narrow steps so if you re not into climbing stairs be this isn t the best place  The receptionist guy was really nice we were late for check in and he didn t get upset  He gave us our keys and walked us to our room  The room itself was SO SMALL But for the price we paid it was fine  We had our own shower and sink and the toilette was down the hall  The shower was so clean in fact the entire room was very clean upon arrival  The toilette down the hall was cleaned a few times a day so it never smelt bad or had someone else s  leavings  in there  They do not come into your room during the day and make the bed for you or anything they don t even give fresh towels but I m sure if you asked they would give  The noise level inside the hotel was quiet during night hours but it was a bit on the noisy side outside of the hotel and from our room we could hear it all  I m a clean freak so I was a little apprehensive about going to a lower end hotel but this place was clean small but clean  I would definitely book a room in Hotel Eureka again 
N => THE Worst hotel ever I stayed in the hotel Eureka last year in e for the Montreal Grand Prix  I didnt expect much from the hotel because i already knew that it was in a somewhat bad neighborhood  Upon arrival I saw  prostitues walk in  The service was terrible tried charging more than they said over the phone  Doors were rickety and the locks we terrible someone could easily break in your room  That night was the worst night ever in a hotel it was  degrees inside no ACa broken tv loud yelling from a bar outside and prostitues coming and going all the while  I would not suggest this hotel to anyone even if they were broke and out of money  
N => It was the worst hotel I ever stayed at The rate for the hotel changes depending on what the office feels they can get form u  They offered a special savings if we paid cash and when we did there was no differance  The room were very small and good luck tring to get clean towels the next day forget about having the room changed over  I was never so hot in my life in a room  I could open the window and hear the singing from the bar below to  am in the morning or close it and bake in the room  Fan works that was the only thing but was not good to cool off the room  No clock radio or phone but there is a tv but it doesnt work  
N => Do not stay here This was the worst experience Ive had at any hotel  First the proprieter gave us a hard time even though we had reserved ahead of time   we had reserved a room with  double beds and he was giving us a room with only   Then he tried to charge a higher price than what we had reserved for  Then he wouldnt take our credit cards and wanted cash    it was troublesome since we didnt have enough on us to cover the stay  We requested paying at checkout and he refused Our room was ridiculously small  They had taken a room for a single double bed and crammed  beds into it  Because of this there was no other furniture in the room except for a TV that didnt work and no space to walk or put our things  There was no closet or drawers and the towels were on the radiator because there was no other place for them The bathroom was in the hallway which we knew ahead of time  There was no AC in the room so it was very hot and stuffy at night despite a ceiling fan I was more disappointed in the service than the room and that was what made it a bad experience  If the hotel manager had been nicer and not tried to cheat us it would have been a much better experience  
N => extra ordinaire  
N => Peor hotel en el que he estado  
N => D not  I repeat do not stay here our story goes something like this my yr old son wanted to take his girlfriend to montreal for her th birthday  they found this hotel online and the price was right  being only  my son did not have a credit card to book this room so my husband said he could use his to hold the room and then pay cash on arrival  my husband called the hotel and arranged this quotpayment planquot with them  they asked my husband to fax them a copy of his credit card so they could hold the room for my son  my husband did as they asked  as the day of travel neared my husband contacted the hotel on more than one occasion to confirm that his card was only holding the room and that they would receive cash payment upon my sons arrival and they were not to charge the room to his card  after being reassured about  times by  different people that this was indeed the plan my son left for his trip  once there my son and his girlfriend checked in and went to their assigned room to drop their belongings off  then he and his girlfriend went out for some dinner  while gone the staff went into their room took all of their belongings and moved them to another room without them knowing  when they came back after dinner they were quite surprised when there was someone else in the room that they had the key for  my husband furious called the hotel they had charged the room to his card after numerous reassurances that they wouldnt  my husband also mentioned about them moving my son without consent giving the scenario that what if he had hidden something of value in the old room to which the man on the phone stated quotwe have only upstanding guests at our hotelquot and than continued to YELL at my husband for calling in such a minor complaint  they refused to reverse the credit card charges and tried to tell my husband that he had given them consent to use his card which he certainly did not  the man was very rude and belligerent to my husband over the phone and when my husband calmly told him that he would not stay there again nor would he allow his friends or family to the man more or less didnt give a crap  they did offer my husband  price on his next stay to which my husband lhed and said NO THANKS 
N => A place to crash after hitting the night life scene nothing else  Excellent location We booked this hotel through Hotwire and it definetely isnt more than  stars if even that  Bus station is next to this hotel which was a huge advantage because we headed Ottawa after Monteal  A lot of bars and restaurants are in this area  Its not far from the shopping area either walk  min  so next time Ill book a hotel from this area Latin quarter but be not exactly this one  The front desk didnt have too good in English but they were friendly and tried to show us locations and places to go  The room itself was very simplified and there was just a bed and a bathroom  Nothing fancy my any means  Didnt feel too comfortable to leave my stuff on the floor but there wasnt any other place  I wouldnt book a room from this hotel if Id be staying longer than a night because Id need to feel more cozy  Basic hotel with no extras  On the positive side the room was clean and the beds were comfortable so we had a good night sleep  A bit like staying in a hostel but just a bit more expensive   
N => buyer beware    check your credit card statement after your stay here my stay was fine but when i got my visa statement for e i noticed a charge of   on e nd     two days after wed checked out of the hotel and left the city  i now live in montreal so i ided to go their myself to sort it out  i was told that when i had called a earlier in the month of e to confirm my reservation was on e th and not e th my fiance kept telling me it was the th so i wanted to make sure i was right the lady who answers the phone booked me another room for the th th    even AFTER i had told her numerous times that i was not booking another room  when i went back to the hotel a month later to ask that the charges be taken off the man i am assuming is the manager insisted it was MY FAULT because i booked another room  he offered me half my money back and would not give me a full refund until my fiance asked me if i wanted to take it to small claims court just as a threat  only THEN did he finally give in and give me a full refund for the hotel room i apparently booked when i was ALREADY in the the hotel    make sure youre VERY clear with them they dont speak the greatest english and tend not to listen to what youre saying so be very clear with them and check your credit card statement at the end of the month  
N => No no no Forget about it even one night will ruin your whole stay Single room  night stay was a nighte  The room was dirty tiny around  square meters  The quotbreakfastquot is rationed to one muffin one coffee and one quotjuicequot  MORE IMPORTANT at night all my legs were bitten by a huge bug which I found later in my bed the itching ruined my next two days when I moved to a ent hotel  Although the have a curfew  after pm and quotno noise allowedquot after that time people on the floor above were moving furniture all night long Wouldnt stay in this dumpster even if they paid meIf you are on a budget go to a hostel   would be much cleaner with the same level of privacy and will cost you a third of their price  Or spend  bucks more and go to a normal hotel but this one   forget it  
N => Rude beyond belief I arrived at the hotel and asked where to park I was told out front  They even pointed to the spot I should park in  Dont park out front  So after I got the parking ticket I confronted them and they quite angrily told me that it was my fault  I waited until the guy who actually told me to park there was there for the conversation  He stayed silent I was told by the woman in charge that I was offered a parking pass when I got there  I received no such offer she called me a liar  A liar People dont give such rude rude people your business  I told her I would never stay there again and she said quotgoodquot  If I have to pay double for a hotel room somewhere else the next time I go to Montreal I will do so gladly  Hotel Europeenne eat it 
N => NIghte at the Europeenne Hotel My friends and I ided to book a room at the hotel despite the terrible reviews because we are grad students on a budget  We are all in our s so we wanted something clean comfortable and basic  The upside is that the Europeenne Hotel is so clean you could probably eat off the floor  I was very impressed at how spotless the hotel was for the price  This is when my positive experience ended We arrived at midnight checked in and went to grab a bite to eat  When we returned two hours later we went to bed  Somehow the air conditioner had been jacked up so high that the three of us could not sleep  My teeth were chattering so hard that my jaw began to hurt  When we asked for the air to be turned off they complied  However when we asked for more blankets the guy at the reception desk LHED AT US  He lhed and said no  We were forced to put on all of our clothing and try to go back to sleep The walls at this place are paper thin  About an hour later  this was now  AM we were awoken by very loud guys next door who were having a party  These were business travelers of some sort who were partying it up like frat boys  Much to our horror the hotel is located next door to the bus station  AT about  AM we were disturbed by the loud speaker system announcing the bus arrivals and departures  This experience put us in a very bad mood for the rest of the day  Seeing as how our mini break was only a day trip out of the city to forget our school stress this ruined our entire trip  I hate this hotel and I hope no one stays here  
N => Very small but clean room It all started when I called to confirm my reservation for  rooms a day before  The guy who picked up the phone was not very friendly not to say more and because I asked for those  rooms to be next to each other he himself offered to cancel the reservation and said quotMam you are too muchquot  Very quotstrangequot neighborhood but within  minutes walking distance from downtown  Otherwise this is a bed and breakfast hotel very very small  floors  I have to say clean  Air conditioners are on but very low fan does not make any difference and it is very hot  The room is extremely tiny if you have your suitcase on the floor there is no space left to walk  I booked it through the priceline for one price when was checking in the price was more and came up to being at least  more then was promised  Parking is not free   day  Not a very good experience would not recommend and would not stay again even for the price  Whoever said that the staff was friendly      mistake  
N => Spartan and clean We stayed at this hotel over the weekend  Its actually just a simple motel  nothing fancy no elevator no real amenities other than some free soap and shampoo and a tv with cable  But it was a good price and we found free on street parking which was great  Our room as spartan as it was was very clean  We did not hang out in the room much anyways  It is about a  min walk to the heart of St Catherine St and Crescent St  Not a bad area at all as long as you dont mind walking  I would stay here again if I was on a budget  it was simple clean and safe  
N => Cant wait to come back  We had a wonderful weekend getaway in Montreal at the Hotel Gault  If you like modern design with a mid century feel youll love the design esthetic of this Hotel  We had come to Montreal specifically to check out the antique stores selling mid century vintage furniture  check out Amherst Street  so we really enjoyed pouring over the many design books in the lobby  Our room was wonderful the service was excellent  we got great restaurant recommendations  The hotel is within walking distance of dozens of restaurants and art galleries all kinds of shopping and even a few museums  We felt the price was a great deal especially considering the delicious breakfast buffet  We are looking forward to coming back next year  
N => Fantastic from start to finish My husband and I spent our wedding weekend at the Gault and I would not have changed a thing  I had spoken with the concierge well in advance and asked for flowers be placed in the room before our arrival  When they brought us up to our room they were there and they were exactly what I had asked for  The staff were friendly courteous and always attentive to our needs  The room was spectacular airy and beautifully furnished  The only oddity that I noticed was the towel hooks    although perfectly functional    needed to be re anchored  
N => Hip romantic retreat with fabulous customer service As is our annual tradition to cap off a week of skiing in the Eastern Townships we spent a weekend in Montreal  While we have really enjoyed the St  Sulpice in Old Montreal in previous years we felt it was time for a change and selected the Gault based on TA reviews amongst other recommendations  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  The lobbyfront deskbarloungerestaurant is essentially one large high ceiling room with funky or and generally attentive service  They were a little short staffed on check in but once they turned attention to us we felt well cared for and our car was whisked quickly away The rooms are incredibly hip and comfortable but probably not to everyones taste  Notwithstanding the stripped down or a large modern art print or photo or two on the walls would be a nice touch  The open style bathroom was just fine although the lighting was a little counter intuitive and lacking a few little details e g  there was no where to hang your towel or robe within easy reach of the shower  If you are inclined to unpack your suitcase you  find the hanging space a little limited and the drawers more fun that functional  But aside from these quibbles it was a fine room  I dont recall the name but we had the king bed room Breakfast is quite lovely with some unusual elements not the standard continental and at least on weekends available quite late into the morning  When I asked for a tray to take breakfast to my room it took a minute to find one but they happily obliged The front desk was helpful with confirming our dinner reservations providing taxis or directions etc  When we arrived back one evening after a glutonous meal at Le Pied au Couchon desperately in need of a degustif we were able to sign for drinks at the bar and walk with them up to our room unheard of in Ontario All in all a pleasure and we would happily stay again  
N => Would have been better with clean towels    Gault hotel is at the heart of Montreal and its location could not be better  The rooms are huge and some details in the design are just amazing and the food was more than ent Yet  I have to admit one of my most vivid memories of the hotel are the stained one with one of those big brown stains and the oter one had pubic hair which obviously werent mine  I cant believe there is so much attention given to details yet I obviously got stained towels that should have been clean since it was nicely folded on the side of the shower I just was not able to figure out how someone could have miss that and to be honest I was disgusted enough just not to ask for replacement towels preferring to find more hygienic ways to get dry  Ive traveled a lot and Im not a very hard client to satisfy  My only need is just a minimal this is just the kind of things I cant get over  This is just the kind of things I cant get over and although my overall stay has been pleasant I would never recommend this hotel  
N => Disappointing From the moment we arrived the hotel failed to live up to expectations  The bellhop had no trolley so meant that he carried one case while we carried the other  At check in we were told we were upgraded but actually ended up in the same room we had booked an essential Top  room  The room itself had the feel of a sauna rather than the modernist feel the website suggests  The whole room felt tired from the chipped wood on the workstation thru the stained showerstall floor to the very office style greyish carpet  We didnt get to try the balcony as the recent snowfall had not been cleared We then read thru the welcome letter which suggested there was a list of recommended restaurants in the handbook but we couldnt find them for love nor money  We then asked at the frontdesk and after about  minutes we finally got a printout of suggestions  However we were warned that theyd all be likely fully booked already and were offered no alternatives Only half of the restaurants on the list had a website address and none of them had a phone number listed  We then went back upstairs to use our PC to check the websites however we needed an adapter to charge it as wed forgotten ours  After much seaching at the front desk no adapter could be found   After that we ided to chance our luck finding a restaurant with a wander around outside but first we thought wed stop by and grab a drink at the bar  The barman was mixing some cocktails for a large group which was fine as he explained that but during that time we sat there without even a menu while the girl in recption stood there doing nothing  After mins we got a drink bear in mind we were one of only  groups in the whole bar Having said all that the breakfast the next morning was great and the staff member on duty was fantastic Next time Ill stay at the Nelligan 
N => Exceptional Service My husband and I stayed at the Gault this past week and we were very impressed at the level of service we recieved  The concierge Andre made exceptional restaurant recommendations as well as helped us plan the next leg of our trip  He even made reservations at other hotels in the other destinations that we chose based on his recommendations and provided us with the confirmations as well as directions and maps to get there  We were shocked when he checked on us at our next destination to make sure we liked the hotel he recommeded as well as to tell us we left some items behind  He then packed up our items and sent them to our home  We are seasoned travelers and have never experienced this level of hospitality anywhere The hotel is lovely  It is orated as urban contemporary with an artistic flair  Our room was large and the bathroom was huge and very nicly orated  it was also impeccably clean  It is within walking distance to restaurants bars and cultural activities  We would confidently recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => th Stay and again SERVICE lacking in some areas Well having just stayed for my th time at the Gault having just written a review from my stay  weeks ago Ill keep this short We had the same room was excellent the Extential room the beds are so comfyYet again however upon arrival no one was there to greet us at the door   its such a small yet major detail management should really address  Lugging your bags up the stairs to the reception desk is not a pleasant way to start your stay  However the concierge Pierre was great My brother needed to find an an eye glass store and he pointed in the right direction and also each time you arrive at the Gault they always personally escort you to your room and explain how everything works very nice touch as always Our rate included a  course table dhote dinner at the Gault Restaurant  The food was outstanding the service was a joke Management needs to teach our young lass Cindy some really service basics  We waited mins to even get a menu another mins before she came and we had to ask for water ask for bread I mean really come on the basics here I had to really just lh at how truly awful she was  When three more couples came down for a drink at the bar me and brother were being entertained as she was run off of her feet service a total of  guests including us  Again the breakfast was outstanding for both morning and again service was slow and without passion nor any real urgency So to sum it be I love the Gault I just wish they would train their staff to have more pride and more passion and an eye for service details  Ill be back again just to see if they actually read these reviews and take the advice to heart of a frequent guest But please do yourself a favour and stay here when visiting Montreal the property is excellent and you will enjoy your stay just beware the slow serviceBtw we also had afternoon tea at the St  James Hotel   do yourself a BIG favour and skip this totally overpriced experience not worth it all  Rather just have a drink at their bar  The property is lovely  
N => Could have been better This used to be one of our favorite hotels  Our visit this summer however left us less than enthused  While the loft suite we reserved was aesthetically interesting it was hard to enjoy our stay after finding hairs in the bathtub and a trashcan full of the previous occupants party refuse in the kitchen including a thrown away pair of jeans   yuck  Service at the hotel is also not what it used to be  When we asked for recommendations for dinner after arriving late from Quebec city the front desk person responded quotthere are lots of places aroundquot with no further clarification  Other attempts to receive service e g  trying to find the bedside clock missing from our suite were equally dismissed with no attempt to provide service or resolve problems  What a contrast with previous experiences when we found the hotel staff to be very attentive and warm  We dont know what happened to this hotel in the last year but with so many great choices in Montreal  we had a great experience at Hotel Le Germain during the same trip we doubt we would risk it and return here  
N => Hotel Gault Bachelor Party My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Gault y     We traveled to Montreal with  other couples for a fun weekend away from the kids  Montreal is fantastic and I would go again I definitely recommend you take a bike tour of the city  However I would not stay at the Gault again  On our nd night there was a bachelor party in the suite next door to ours  Yes a bachelor party in a hotel where I was paying night to sleep About two dozen twenty somethings strippers be prostitutes alcohol and lots of noise  They partied all night and into the morning  My wife and I called down to the reception desk many times but it was not until am when I put on clothes and went down there myself that something was finally done  I thought the party should have been broken up and the guests kicked out but the poor guy working alone in the middle of night did not do that  He merely moved the party but the constant noise of their coming and going meant no sleep The next day I kindly told the manager that I was not paying for that night  He actually tried to bargain with me offering   off  I explained that the main reason I was staying at the hotel was to sleep and since that did not happen I was not paying  The manager did ultimately agree to comp that night but I really did not give him any other choice Other than that experience I liked the hotel  Great breakfast  Terrible gym  Good location  However for the price I expect to be staying somewhere that would have dealt with the bachelor party in a fast definitive manner  
N => Fabulous The Gault was everything it said it would be and more  The Concierge Andre was an excellent host and made our stay extra special  He advised us on the best that Montreal had to offer and was enthusiastic to ensure our stay was perfect The hotel staff were st and chic  Their efficiency ensured that our needs were always met  Our roomprivate terrace was very comfortable and we had several nights of peaceful sleep Coming from Europe the serenity of the Gault contributed to getting over jet lag alot more quickly  Having stayed in numerous hotels around the world from Palma de Mallorca to Sydney  I would highly recommend the Gault as a true boutique hotelDevon UK  
N => Its a gem We had a fantastic experience at Hotel Gault  I cant remember the last time I stayed in a place where I couldnt find a single flaw  Everything from interior design to hotel staff was impeccable  Our room was incredibly spacious and seriously felt like home away from home  The staff was personable attentive and helpful with all our requests from parking our car to recommending and reserving wonderful dining options in the area  We felt like we were visiting some sort of dear friends thats how well the staff took care of us  I could go on and on  We ended up extending our stay in Montreal and hotel Gault had a lot to do with it  
N => The Perfect Weekend I brought my husband to Montreal to celebrate his birthday  Thanks to the Hotel Gault it was a perfect weekend The staff Andre Robert Phillip and Melinda to name a few was very friendly attentive and extremely helpful  The Hotels or is modern but has a very intimate atmosphere  We were given a beautiful room on the th floor    extremely spacious and great view  The bare cement floors tend to get a bit cold except in the bathroom area where the floors are heated  The restaurantbar in the lobby was great  Food we had breakfast and lunch was good nice variety  The only quotcriticismquot was that the gym was very small  In fairness though we didnt even use the gym while there because we were trying to make the most of our two day stay in Montreal  We would definitely go back to Hotel Gault  We wouldnt stay anywhere else 
N => St room excellent breakfast This hotel was a fantastic start to our holiday in Canada  On arrival someone took our bags from our taxi  The welcome was friendly and informative  We were shown up to our room by Dominic  He showed us round the room and told us where everything was  He gave us a map and showed us where and how to get to all the places we wanted to go  There were cool gadgets in the room    a fun height adjustable table stereo TV DVD player heated floor etc  Location in Old Montreal was excellent  The basilica is only   minutes down the road and the subway is easy to find Victoria  Breakfast was included in the rate and was a quothelp yourself buffetquot of breads juice jams pate cheese fruit cereal and also cooked eggs   omlette and benedict are to be recommended The only criticism we could come up with was that the heated concrete floor was slightly scuffedked but hardly something which would spoil our stay Definitely recommended  
N => its hard to review when youre left speechless   words or photos as well actually cannot possibly do the gault justice  i took my boyfriend there for a long weekend to celebrate his birthday  had read as much as possible about the gault online previous to booking  i assumed that after three months of planning the hype had almost certainly risen to a level that no hotel could possibly live upto  delighted to say i was dead wrong  a few highlights the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in breathtaking archetecture a terrace view of montreal breakfast fit for royalty and above all andre  sorry to namedrop andre no pressure   if an afternoon passed when we didnt see him both of us were disappointed  we even abandonded breakfast in our heavenly bed for breakfast downstairs in hopes of having a chat with him breakfast downstairs was lovely as well of course  no compliments will do  you simply must meet him and the gault for yourself  i will never even consider staying at another hotel in montreal ever again  in fact id like to try a different room every time i happen by  absolutely fantastic  
N => Quiet and Sophisticated First of all I wanted a room with a terrace but it wasnt available  I didnt realize that all their rooms have doorswindows that open completely that allow fresh air in and transports you to another time  Below passed a horse drawn tourist cairrage over cobble stoned streets and I was completely taken  A minor drawback was the maid service that came in at turn down service time rather than the morning while we were out but one call to the front desk immediatley rectified the situation with a follow up to see if it was to our liking  THe lobby is always quiet but homey if modern  THere was a quiet cail party the night beofre we left and it was unobtrusive to the guests  The staff was super  Incredible Lychee tinis by Adrianne who seemed to always have been there  Everyone in the reviews talk about the staff and they really are the best asset of the hotel  THe hotel was pricey but I knew that when I booked  No surprises  THe breakfast the next day always seemed worth it in the end  We were never more than a  cab ride from anywhere and the metro too was near  The beds were very comfortable and made you want to sleep longer  THe heated bathroom floor does work quite well  I have stayed at Ws elsewhere but this is taken to the different level  Its not clubby or young  THe or  be a bit cold but it was actually condusive to just lounging around downstairs  THe black clad staff were so quiet but always at beck and call  My best hotel experience  
N => The creme de la creme This was one of our best hotel stays ever  The room was superb the staff delightful and the breakfast a gourmet treat We would return to Montreal just to stay at the Gault    
N => Cool classy oasis in a busy city My wife and I stayed at the Gault during Grand Prix weekend our second stay here and what a great way to enjoy the weekend  Close enough to the action by Metro taxi or on foot yet a world away from the crowds  The other reviews are accurate we really cant add much  When we checked out they asked us to complete a survey  One question asked was quotimprovements neededquot  Our reply   NONE  
N => For great hotel go no further I just spent an incredible weekend in Montreal and stayed three nights at the Hotel Gault  The staff the room the food attention to detail was beyond expectations  I really was sad when we checked out although they even did a great job on that as well by bringing the car to the front and loading our baggage while we ate a delicious breakfast  The room was spacious beautifully orated lots of light and the heated bathroom floor was a treat  The bed was super comfortable and everything was very clean  They had prepared flowers for my fiancee prior to our arrival  There was a minor detail however  there was a noise from the vent overhead that sounded like dripping water in the duct  It wasnt often and I tuned it out after a bit but was a little annoying  I never bothered to say anything so I wont fault them for it and might have been specific to the room After a long day of walking the streets of montreal one evening we rented movies and they made popcorn and tea for us to enjoy  They quickly brought it to our room and set the tv and brought in the munchies The staff by the way were the most helpful nicest people  They always genuinely smiled and wished us a good eveningday when we passed by or asked how things were  It prompted me to send them a thank you note upon my return Ill be back next time Im in Montreal on vacation Thanks hotel gault for a memorable weekend  
N => A   hotel with a   service We stayed at the hotel for  night after reading reviews and where severly impressed  We stayed for  nights at the Auberge Saint Antoine in Quebec which was lacking service and cleanliness and it was a bliss when we arrived by taxi at the hotel Gault  The staff rushed to carry our suitcases they were so fast the cab driver did not have time to get off the car The check in was effortless   they even asked us where we were going to eat as it was Valentines day and immediatly booked us in a restaurant that was excellent The bedroom was awsomeThe breakfast was out of this world by the quality and the presentation  And it is included in the price of the room we asked to have it delivered to our room for only  CAD and it was served on a table amazingWe sadly left   especially as it costed much less than the St Antoine a rip off and we felt at home  
N => Near perfection Hotel Gault picked for our getaway weekend due to raves in Trip Advisor lived up to its billing  Funky friendly great breakfasts romantic quiet roomvery helpful staff  First rate in every way  
N => The Best Hotel in Montreal Our experience at Hotel Gault has been great from start to finish  First of all when we got to the hotel we found out that we had been upgraded to a larger room for no additional charge  The room was wonderful  huge clean stylish excellent bed and linens high tech tv and sound system wonderful bathroom with a large bathtub etc etc    The staff could not be more helpful and nice and went out of their way to make sure that our stay was pleasant  The breakfast which was inclued in the price was wonderful as well it included a very nice buffet as well as a hot selection which was not only delicious but also presented in a very beautiful way I have stayed in another high end hotel in Montreal but this one is by far much better  I cant wait to go back 
N => How Designer Hotels Should Be  
N => Amazing This place is a total gem Hotel Kutuma is the nicest place I have ever stayed My experiance even tops staying in the Romeo and iet suite at sandals where I had a private butler The staff were so kind and yet down to earth  When I arrived they promptly checked me in offered me a drink and brought my bags up to my room  The or was awesome totally my style top to bottom  The bed was super comfy and the sheets were not only great to look at they were super comfy too The hotel was so clean it was if no one had ever stayed in that room before  My only complaint was that the water pressure was not excellent but i stayed on the top floor and it would likely be better on the lower floors  I would not only recomend this hotel to others I plan on writing an article about it  It has opened my eyes to the benefits of boutique hotels over the big chains  Kudos to you Hotel Kutuma Keep up the great work  
N => Bum Deal When we arrived the entrance was not clear  The reception was just just enough for two people  Two flights of stairs to our room with two suitcases  The room was tiny  The wardrobe was a joke  The bathroom was small  A small area of carpet between the fridge and bed was wet  We pointed this out to the manager there and then  Said it would be sorted  No one came that night to fix the problem  The bed was too high and soft  Before going out next day we again mentioned the damp carpet  On returning to our room at the end of the day sight seeing  The damp patch was still there  Once again mentioned to reception  Yes later that evening a man came into the room and lared the fridge was leaking  About  minutes later the problem was fixed  This could have been fixed while we where out for the day instead of us having to hang around in the room waiting for the man to go before we could shower and relax for the night  The next day we were to book out and ided to have breakfast  Not the best it was just fried potatoes and veggies no meat no eggs   strange  Left feeling hungry  We have stayed at lots of hotels and this was not the best  I dont understand the write ups  Yes it was clean  But not excellent   
N => Large rooms clean well located We enjoyed our  night stay  We actually didnt have any interaction with the staff except for checking in where we were offerred a complimentary drink  It seemed to us more like renting an apartment for a few days  We paid in advance and just left the keys in the room as we left as there also seemed to be no one around  This isnt a complaint though that was fine  The room was on the second floor large clean with kitchen and dining area  Not many windows but a door to a fire escape  The African theme was interesting  It was very quiet during our stay we didnt hear any traffic noise or noise from other rooms  It was nice to have a refrigerator to put snacks in  The hotel is only a few blocks from the Sherbrooke metro and there are dozens and dozens of restaurants within a few blocks  We love Ethiopian food and enjoyed eating at the restaurant downstairs which seemed very popular  
N => nicest spot in Montreal What a wonderful hotel  The staff was pleasant and extremely helpful  They went out their way to make sure my wife and I had everything we needed  We ordered Ethiopian food from the restaurant downstairs for room service  The food was excellent The location is great  Right near a metro station and close walking distance to anything you might want to do in Montreal We cant wait to go back 
N => Serious disconnect with these reviews Not sure if there was a management change but there seems to be a serious disconnect from my experience and the other reviews  We booked  ior suites for  based on their reviews on trip advisor  We called on the drive up to Montreal and they took our credit card info and said we were all set  When we arrived they told us that the the ior suite was not available  However a deluxe suite was available for  more  We told them that we had just reserved this suite about   hours earlier by phone but they said only internet reservations were valid not phone reservations   Hmm ok   Since it was only a  difference I tried to at least give them the benefit of the doubt and I asked to see both rooms amazingly the deluxe suite was smaller with a queen bed instead of a king and far less impressive than the ior suite  The rooms I saw were pretty dingy amp were covered with a leopard skin or and reeked  I mean reeked of cheap massage oil  Needless to say I didnt take the room  They also tried to work us for unnecessary valet parking by lying to us about parking hours on the street  Anyway we left and the first place we found was for a far better room for  per nightabout   of the room cost at Katuma Took us  minutes people were happy to have our business and room was much nicer and included breakfast as well  In all my stays at places reviewed well on Trip advisor this one was by far the worst of the bunch  my advice is STAY AWAY FROM KUTUMA  
N => Comfortable Unique Hotel in Great Spot We had a great stay at the Hotel Kutuma highlighted by the friendly service comfortable bed and sitting area and the best bathroom  Got there early and was unable to get in to our room  In the meantime we were treated to a complimentary delicious cup of coffee  We were able to leave them our luggage and car and went off to explore the city on foot and Metro stop a bit of a walk but nothing too bad  When we returned our luggage was in our room  The king sized bed was soooo comfortable but the highlight was the bathroom  There was a huge deep tub with this great showerhead that adjusted to your height and side panels featuring additional water jets  Very cool  I cant say enough how nice the proprietor was and I had a great time wandering around the surrounding neighborhood  In fact a few blocks down there is a street closed to traffic with numerous bars and restaurants  
N => It was a good experience After reading all the reviews on the tripadvisor thanks for all your advice and opinions we ided to give it a try  We loved our room   it was very cozy and we felt like we were in our own small studio To update any previous reviews the bathrooms now have a proper showerhead so taking a shower was no problem at allThe service was great   very friendly and genuine people   even gave us a big umbrella as a souvenir which they provide at the hotel entrance for the convenience of the guests I did hear that the restuarant downstairs is great but did not have enough time to go try it   so many good restaurants in this city  
N => Do yourself a favour   stay at Hotel Kutuma I stayed at the Hotel Kutuma in ember and have to say that I was blown away  Location It is wonderfully located on St Denis which as others have said include great restaurants and some shopsbars  It is a  minute walk even shorter when its not snowing to Sherbrooke Metro station  It has a convenience store about  stores down which sells your basics including alcohol and phone cards if you need to call long distance  Local calls at the Hotel Kutuma are free Service From check in to check out the service was just overwhelming  This small hotel puts the larger chains to shame  I arrived by taxi on the opposite side of the road  It was snowing heavily but the hotel staff ran across the road past the mounds of snow to get my suitcase  They offered me a coffee straight away and the check in process was over in  minutes  They had upgraded me as well which was a nice surprise Room  I got in the end Room Well what can I say it was superb  The room had light dimmers which was on when I went into the room  They had also put on some jazz music before I arrived which was a great touch  The African theme worked very well and everything was tastefully orated  ALL ROOMS have been recently reated to include high tech showers though water pressure was a bit of a problem so you dont have to worry about it not having a shower   believe me you want to see this shower Flat screen tv awesome bed comfy couch well equipped kitchenette and cable tv are just a few of the benefits  Amenities All the usual bathroom products plus free wi fi  What more could you ask forRestaurant It was quite simply the BEST food I have had for a long time  I have never had Ethiopian food before but seriously you need to try it Conclusion The only bad thing Ill say about it is that it doesnt have a lift which isnt a problem because they carry your suitcase up for you and the water pressure was a bit low  But for the price amazing value location and general ambiance you CANNOT GO WRONG  
N => Fantastic Hotel The Kutuma hotel was everything it was said to be  A lovely place and the service was fantastic  All the people at the hotel went the extra mile to make our stay special  We were in Montreal to attend the Presidents Cup  The Hotel is located in a super spot with tons of restaurants  The Blue Nile restaurant in the hotel is really good and was one of the best meals of our trip  Some reviews complained about the lack of shower but our room had a bath and shower I would certainly stay in this hotel again if I were to go back to Montreal  It was spotless and actually looks like the photos on the website  The friendly atmosphere and willingess to help of all the staff was appreciated 
N => Wheres the shower This hotel was in a central location  The room was clean but had a strong smell of cleaning products  And how we missed our bathroom     we are not sure Too excited to explore Montreal I think     but when we went to take a shower there was none  All there was on offer was a bath with a nozzel on a short hose  We were only in the hotel for one night and I opted to check in early to the next hotel and use the shower there  
N => Beautiful Hotel My husband and I just returned from a  night stay at the Hotel Kutuma  The location was perfect   easy access to the Metro as well as within walking distance to key locations Quartier Latin Downtown etc   The staff was wonderful   very polite and helpful  We stayed in a King room  The room was tastefully orated with an african theme   very cozy  The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in It was like sinking into a cloud The bathroom was beautiful but in our room there was no shower   just a large soaking tub with a hand shower  I did find it charming to see my husband in this huge tub navigating the hand shower  Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Kutuma  We definitely recommend it to other couples who are enjoying a romantic holiday in Montreal  
N => A Great Place to Stay The Hotel Kutuma is well situated on St Denis Street with lots of restaurants shops amp galleries close by  The selection of types of food available is quite amazing  Within walking distance to the Old City amp port as well as downtown Montreal Our room was clean amp comfortable with a bit of an African theme leopard print sheets rattan furniture etc to it We enjoyed our stay amp will return when we are back in Montreal The Truemans Oshawa Ontario 
N => Watch your credit card I made air through Expedia and called the hotel direct  I used the same credit card for both  A week later an airline called me for credit card authorization for a Shawn Dubec to fly from Chicago to Detroit and back with my credit card number  First of all the name Dubec sounds French to me and second I have not had any trouble with Expedia before  Therefore I seem to think that my credit card unauthorized use came from the hotel through some of its employees  I had requested a double room as I was traveling with a friend  They gave us a room with a double bed  There was no way both of us could sleep in that bed as we are both very mature men in other words  FAT  They put him in a erate room that night and eventually let him stay in that room all weekend  His room had air  mine did not  It did have a ceiling fan though  It was around  degrees  The room was ok the halls are bad  I would probably stay there again if I could get away from using my credit card as a guarantee  
N => Hotel filth OH MY GOD  I stayed there  years ago and thought it was ent  I returned y th weekend  and it seemed to have gone downhill  The carpets were total filth  There was a used condom in the waste basket in my friends room  In general they are friendly but you would think the would at least vaccuum the carpets at least once a year There was dark stains and filth that was apparently not new  
N => Great experience I was a little concerned about this place when I read the reviews but I gave it a try  I had no problems here at all  The owners and staff were very helpful with directions and answering questions about what to see and do in Montreal  One morning we even breakfast with his family even though that was not included in the price of the hotel  Yes the place is older and not all rooms have bathrooms in the rooms but I would not say it was dirty at all  The neighborhood can be a bit sketchy but I did not feel threatened or unsafe  I would recommend giving the place a try  
N => Stay Far Away Stay Far AwayI I stayed  days at this hotel It is very close to everythingincluding the shuttle from the Central Bus station to the airport I would have switched to another hotelbut I was tiredit was raining The bathroom was unsanitaryun clean Some of the knobsfixtures broken The room had old grape stems behind the bedand a lot of dirt There were some kind of bugs in the roomI discovered I had to got to the hospital when I returned for treatment I would never stay there againfor any amount of money offeredAlsoan item turned up missing from my luggage I remember the words of another reviewer of this hotelanything of value was taken I had taken what I thought was everything out of my suitcaseof value But missed the small itemI noticed someone had been in my room when I was out The desk person is young and friendlybut the other staff lurking around were a bit scary I would not wish this hotel on anyone to stay at     
N => Had To Call Police I stayed in this hotel during a very busy festival in Montreal  First off on the top floof a piece of the building was missing and it was covered by a tarp  The man who owns the hotel also sleeps in the lobby    weird I had a friend who missed his flight and needed a place to stay as he could not find a room ANYWHERE  I was staying in a single room but offered him the floor the guy at the hotel did not like this  He stormed into my room barking at me to get my friend out or to pay an extra   It got to the point where I was so terrified that I called   I didnt sleep that night but left early thae next morning  I ADVISE YOU NOT TO STAY HERE  Be careful 
N => Fine Hotel Not Five Stars By Any Means We went to Montreal for a long weekend with  children  Hotel Le Crystal is in an excellent location   convenient to fantastic restaurants Old Montreal and shopping  The hotel offers valet parking which was helpful since we drove to Montreal  We stayed in a Deluxe suite   small bedroom small living room galley kitchen and a balcony  We wanted a suite for our two kids  amp to share the sofa bed and for my wife and I to have a private bedroom  That worked out fine  The or was minimalist   clean but not sumptuous  The bathroom not too small and not elegant  The sinks did not drain properly we called maintenance but they still worked poorly  The balcony is a cement stoop with uncomfortable furniture  However the shower was great  Service and staff are extremely attentive but our room was not ready it took about two hours after it was promised  They comped our parking which was acceptable to us  Hotel parking is day  The open unsecured lot across the street is day  The concierge was EXCELLENT   he gave us great restaurants except one  Eat at Beaver Hall Irish Embassy Winston Churchill Eggspectations Pain Diore  Skip Trinity Greek seafood   over priced too loud  Valet and front desk were also attentive Overall our experience was fine we were expecting a five star hotel and Le Crystal is  at best  It is not worth night which is what we paid  If we were to go to Montreal again we would choose a different hotel  
N => Nice but has a few kinks to work out We went to Montreal for a long weekend without children  Hotel Le Crystal is in an excellent location   convenient to fantastic restaurants Old Montreal and shopping  The hotel offers valet parking which was helpful since we drove to Montreal  We stayed in a ior suite   small bedroom small living room galley kitchen  The or was minimalist   clean but not sumptuous  The bathroom was large but not elegant  However the shower was great  Hotel Le Crystal has two problems   the food and the spa  Service and staff are extremely attentive but the food was the worst that we had in the city  Also at least when we were there the spa treatments are a waste of money  The young girls are friendly and talkative but the massage left much to be desired  If we were to go to Montreal again we would choose a different hotel  
N => Immaculate This was a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal  Steps to shopping and many restaurants  Staff was very friendly we arrived at noon and they let us have our room right away which was appreciated  The room was immaculate  The little kitchen area was convenient and beautiful grantie countertops equipped with microwave stove sink coffeeespressocappucino machine  The bedroom was a arate room closed off from the rest of the suite with sliding doors  The living area was nice and spacious as was the balcony furnished with tables and chairs to sit outside  Bathroom was beautiful but didnt have a bath tub just a large shower  Would definitely stay here again 
N => Luxurious and great location We really enjoyed our visit to the Hotel Le Crystal last year  The hotel was as other guests had advised   upscale very close to the shopping on Rue Ste Catherine great conciergereception service and nice touch with the outdoor hot tub  They are also very generous with the Molton Brown toiletries  We didnt eat in the restaurant so I cant comment on that  I wouldnt hesitate to recommend the hotel but I would point out that not all the rooms have the tub as advertised so do ask to switch rooms if you want that  Our first night was spent in an urban suite which did not have a tub but was a good size roombathroom still  We really wanted the tub as I had a back problem and wanted to take a soak so next day we asked to move rooms and were rewarded with an upgrade to a much bigger suite no problem  Also yes the lighting is a little dark and they added a mini bar charge which wasnt correct but they removed it on request and it didnt detract from a great hotel and a great stay  
N => The review I would have wanted to see when researching Montreal hotels My girlfriend and I just returned from our stay at Le Crystal  I spent a lot of time researching hotels in the city and was surprised that this didnt make more best of lists  Im assuming this is the case because it is only a little over a year old LOCATION At first I thought we might want to be near old Montreal but after walking through briefly I understood why all of the natives frown on the area  I was considering Hotel Nelligan and am glad we opted for Le Crystal  Old Montreal is worth seeing but it is filled exclusively with elty tourist shops a few restaurants and obscure galleries  Lacks the charm of a Quincy ket in Boston but was fun to walk through briefly  Le Crystal is right in the middle of downtown great access to shopping and nightlife around the block the arena across the street and Le Queue de Cheval is literally across the parking lot SERVICE I originally requested an early check in to make the most of our stay but this was not possible  Our trip did not get off to the best start as we had to wait an hour and a half in the lobby  Needless to say we were not pleased but didnt make any mention of this  When we were ready for check in they had upgraded us to the penthouse suite which definiely helped  The concierge was great as well very personable and friendly DININGWe dined at La Coupole for brunch and really enjoyed ourselves  They featured an extensive buffet and everything was fresh and very good  ROOM In terms of cleanliness no complaints whatsoever  Given the room we stayed in there were plenty of amenities  I really wanted a fireplace and the large tub  It would be nice if they had dimmers   plus the bedroom lighting was a little lacking but the rooms were really as described  DVD player is only available upon request  Bathrooms are very spacious  The bed featured a very soft and comfortable Tempur Pedic mattress and high quality linens  The kitchenette is definitely nice to have as well POOLOUTDOOR HOT TUBSAUNA Both were freezing was really looking forward to spending more time in each and ended up using the tub which was much warmer  There are two saunas which are tiny and can accommodate a couple per unit  The facility was great just wish it was warm enough to make us want to stay and be comfortable OVERALLMy biggest complaint is that for the amount of money we spent we didnt get to spend as much time to enjoy all of the amenities afforded to us  Would have really enjoyed the poolhot tub more if they were heater but they were freezing I really think that we found a great hotel there and look forward to returning when it is not as busy  I dont think you will find another hotel with as many amenities and the quality of the rooms and service was great  I think the W just seemed too modern and impersonal and this was modern but warm elegant and classy  
N => Great concept but a little impersonal Le Crystal has a beautiful lobby and trendy or throughout but I found both the rooms and service lacking the substance youd find up the street at Hotel de la Montagne or The Vogue  The suites felt cramped   which would be acceptable in Manhattan but a bit odd in Montreal  The lighting in the rooms was again reminiscent of somewhere else   the kind of lighting you get at a hotel in South Beach which might work well in the Florida sun but not as much in a grey Montreal ember  I couldnt get the iPod dock to work  Not all the suites have arate soaker tub baths as advertised on the website   I did get moved to a suite with a bath for the second night but I had to make my case a couple of times  The staff who finally moved me were nice but the overall staff experience was less positive than my experience with other hotels in the area  Overall Id say its a great place to stay if youre looking for a flashy trendy hotel and the lobby certainly impresses but if you want great rooms and more personal service you get more value from your money elsewhere  
N => Elegant Hotel Modern elegant flaired hotel in a great location  Staff were friendly and professional  We stayed in a quotsuperiorquot room for  nights  It included a mini bar and seating area  Everything was nicely orated and in prestine condition  The quotsuperiorquot room we had did not have tub just a large rain shower  Robes were very nice  There was full size iron and board too  The Valet was great  So nice to have help with luggage  Daily newspaper a real nice touch In fact it was in English  Interesting that the staff knows whether to leave a French newspaper or English one We agree with many of the positive comments left by other reviewers  The outdoor hottub and sunk on the th floor we found to be a special treat especially at night  The pool is lovely too  Reminded me a bit of the Mediterranean  The Spa looked really nice  We too could not find ice on the th floor as printed on the Elevator directory  Not having a DVD or movie on demand did not concern us as we found much to do in the city  But the weather was great and I could understand in poor weather one might like to have the option of a movie in the room We did not dine on site except for breakfast  I found breakfast to be okay  Service was a bit slow  Menu at bit average  We did have room service one night  The menu was acceptable and service was as promised  Hot water at certain times of the day is not abundant  But I think that is average for hotels of this size  My only less than ideal concern was the size of our room  The desk was awfully close to the coffee table in front of the soaf  And the queen bed was in a tight room  But since it was not a suite I guess it is reasonable compared to the nightly rate Given that there are a few other nice hotels in Montreal I would probably give one of them a try next time  Just to mix it up and experience new settings  Montreal is such a lovely city  
N => Bad Management  No understanding of relationships I had booked a room this morning to stay in this evening  I had an emergency situation and had to cancel the reservation only a few hours after making it    with plenty of time for hotel to rebook the room  While Expedia had no problem with the cancellation the hotel manager emphatically refused to be sympathetic and allow a cancellation without charge  The room has been cancelled with no credit given  So they intend to charge me and presumably resell the room as well The irony is that I was excited about staying there because I heard this place was nice and wanted to sample it with the intention of reserving up to  rooms for an upcoming conference  I planned to rebook this sample trip for next week now no wayWhen it comes to attitude management always sets the tone and their cold attitude and lack of understanding leads me to believe this is probably emblematic of their staff  No where I want to bring my sales team I stay in high end hotels every week and will probably never stay here because of this  
N => Service Nul  
N => This place is not  prestigious  at all We stayed at the hotel for one night on the ust long weekend for a music festival Montreal was holding  It should have been our first indication that the  pan glass window at the reception meant that their were security issues in the building but who would have thought that anyone would have to truly worry about their safetyWe left our luggage in the room while we were on Montreal island for the festival  To our surprise the next morning while attempting to pay for breakfast our money would be missing  Our bags were tampered with and our wallets were emptied  Once reporting what had happened to the Manager at quotHotel Le Prestigequot  he was completely unhelpful and rude  I HIGHLY recommend that NO ONE stays at this hotel  The staff will violate you and your belongings and they cannot be trusted  When someone pays  for a room which is locked they do not expect to return to a staff member stealing their belongings  Please take my advice do not stay here  
N => This genuine good deal has an excellent location  Just off Place Dupuis you are next to a restaurant area  blocks from the major Metro station Berri UQAM and  blocks from the central bus station connecting to Quebec and the airport  We walked to Vieux Montreal in  minutes  Since our last stay in  the place has been spruced up  Comfortable ent size rooms with telephone TV refrigerator and wireless internet connections  Helpful staff  Adequate lobby  A liftelevator is available from the lobby level to the two floors of rooms but you have stairs from the street up to the lobby  An unusual feature staff brings a satisfactory continental breakfast to your room we love the chocolate croissants  
N => So bad we turned around and left to go elsewhere at pm I dont know where to start with this one  We are still upset by it The hotel carpark was so tight that I hit my car a rental off a pillar which was not a good start to the experience  The hotel staff upon check in was friendly to be fair but it was all downhill from there  be we should have guessed with the status of the other reviews on this site but the hotel looked ok on paper and some of the reviews were not too bad so we booked the hotel initially on that basis The requested room was not available so instead of a double room as requested we got two adjoining rooms not the end of the world but not a good way to start  When we tried to get a double room we were told the hotel was full and there was no other option  These things happen     all hotels can be full When we went to the rooms we recoiled     There was a bad smell coming from each of the rooms and we are still not sure what each of the smells were and really do not want to know  The carpets were stained  There were insects in the bathrooms  There was mold on the bathroom ceiling as well as rust on the rail holding up the none too clean looking shower curtain  As per other reviewers the place was not cleanWe used the admittedly free and good quality internet to get another room in another hotel and we promptly left 
N => Never coming back     Bad   how bad Bad   Room is more of a hostile   No closet just  little hangers on the wall  Beds are disgusting wont pass inspection  Bathroom has no shampoo cream or place to hang a towel  Hotel runs out of towels  Breakfast is not a breakfast   its a joke  There is no bar or restaurant so they make you order at front desk  choices bun   croissant   or croissant  lol  small coffee and a boxed juice  Hotel charges more then some other better hotels and has lots of false advertising Stay at your own risk   but it doesnt worth night  
N => Would Never Stay There Again When we got to the hotel the reservation was not booked in their computer system which meant they never reserved a room for me   meanwhile I had my e mail confirming my reservation  The front desk then had me go threw all their paper work to see if I could find the reservation hello that was not up to me to do  Then we were told they had one room available and that they would give it to us  The room was okay   fairly clean but there was only one pillow per person the towel where the size of hand towels there was no shampoo or soap in the bathroom and no alarm clock or clock in the room  The window had no screen to it so we couldnt leave it open during the night or when we werent there  Also all the homeless people must hang around the area Ive never seen so many homeless people in my life  So for what we paid for it wasnt worth it  
N => Filty dirty I have stayed a few times in the past at this hoted it was ok and clean  You cant expect much for the money you pay  But my last stay was just horrible the room was extremely dirty stains on the bathroom walls etc  The place must of changed hands  Would not recommend it to anyone  Even if you just need a place to crash DONT  
N => Needs Work The hotel was convieniently located to the attractions we were interested in but the hotel seemed to be in a state of run down  We did not feel secure finding people homeless sleeping in the hotel doorway and late at night the front desk was unattended and doors open to allow anyone to come and go with no problem  Our room was sufficient but needed some TLC ie bathroom door handle falling off and toilet seat was broken  We would not stay there again  
N => A great bargain After reading all the mixed reviews on this site I was nervous about staying here  But my fears were unfounded  This place turned out to be a great bargain  The location is excellent  walking distance to one of the main subway stations  The staff was courteous and helpful  Our room was clean bed was comfortable  And breakfast was ent and always served on time  
N => Had to get out of there We had a terrible experience at this hotel  The rooms were very dis tasteful and dirty  I was woken up several times during the night by other guests going up and down the noisy staircase  I would not recommend staying here to anybody  We were planning to stay there for  nights but my partner and I could only handle one night beware 
N => I must have had the non refurb room So I was wondering about this hotel when I booked it but I read these reviews and that put my mind at ease and I could not have been more disappointed when I arrived    I must have gotten the only non reated room As I was walking down the hall to my room   I noticed several spots on the carpet   and I dismissed it as spilled cleaning products or something  However I entered my room and was sad to see multiple stains on the carpet in the room  The bedspread was ancient and seemingly full of dust as were the curtains  The paint was peeling from around the window which looked out onto a parking lotI asked the front desk if I could switch rooms and they had none available I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family  
N => Good place for your money This is a great hotel for your money  How many places do you know that will deliver breakfast to your room for under  a night It is walking distance to all amenities  Roger at the front desk was great  He provided anwsers to all our questions and gave good suggestions on where to go in the city  The only problem that I had with the room was that there was no hot water one morning and there was no clock whatsoever in the room  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to save some money  
N => A bit shady   The lobby is nice then we were given a room on the first floor  It was old and musty  Right when we entered we started sneezing  It was unbearable  Then we got our room changed to one upstairs on the nd floor  This was actually a nice room and looked like it had some reations done to it  All in all it was clean and provided us a place to sleep  Oh yeah its right in the middle of the gay town  
N => I am glad that I didnt stay here  I booked this hotel before I know anything about Montreal  As I was reading the guidebook and reviews from here I realized that this hotel is right in the middle of the gay village  I ided to change the hotel to downtown area  We had a chance to explore the village neighborhood when we visited Montreal and passed by this hotel  To be fair I have never step in this hotel  it would not be fair for me to judge if this hotel provide great services or not  But just walking around the neighborhood I am glad that I switch to another hotel in downtown Its not a pretty neighborhood a bit ghetto ish  I just feel that with the price and so many options in Montreal There are definitely better hotels in the better areas to choose from  
N => Pretty good for the price  We were able to book a room on relatively short notice at the Hotel le Saint Andre for our first visit to Montreal  All in all we were very pleased  The location is very convenient just off St Catherine at the west end of the Village  We were on the top floor which does not have elevator access odd but not a big deal for us since we were traveling somewhat light  The room was quite basic not a reated room but it was also comfortable for the price  The staff were very friendly and helpful from the booking stage right up to checkout  The breakfast delivered to the room warm croissants two cups worth of coffee person and orange juice was very nice Other item of note parking    while free off street parking is offered it is rather limited about  spaces for the entire hotel so beware if you are driving to Montreal as we did  We were able to get a space but it was tricky and took navigating carefully in the tight parking lot  We definitely plan to stay here again on our next visit to Montreal 
N => Do not stay here We have just returned from a fantastic trip to Canada which was partially ruined by our final hotel   the St Andre in Montreal  We booked months ago but were disappointed to find an extremely basic and outdated room for the cost of a ent hotel premier lodge in London  The walls were a nauseating yellow the airconditioner limited and noisy the breakfast which is so acclaimed on this website  be wonderful if you have been travelling in Asia but was nothing special unless you love lots of repetitive white bread products and lukewarm tea On our first day we requested a room change as we suspected that we had simply got a poor standard room but all of the nicer updated rooms were smoking not an option if you dont smoke unless you dont mind the smell  We also had a problem with security a brand new dress that I had bought disappeared   we reported it to the reception not expecting any compensation but thought they ought to know in case it had happened before or something and were met with unbelievable rudeness  We were practically accused of lying  Just to put this into context we are a very polite and well travelled couple who have stayed in budget and not so budget accomodation all over the world and have never experienced such a poor standard of service for a disproportionate amount of money  Also I never write these things but am so incensed by our stay that I felt I had to warn others  Stay here at your peril 
N => elevators The only problem we encouture was the elevator did not go to the rd floor  If we would have been inform of thiswe would have book the st ornd floorwhich we will do next time  We are planning ti go back next year ampstay at the same hotel saint andre  I just think when people book there reservations through the internet or the hotel itselfthis info should be shared with the customer  
N => Very friendly atmosphere   a place to relax I stayed in this hotel when I visited a conference in Montreal and I felt very happy there  The atmosphere was very friendly the breakfast was served in the room and just opposite the hotel was a nice restaurant  This suited me the first days being exhausted after the flight and the start of the conference  It was also close to the metro with an excellent book shop  Most of the shopping in Montreal is underground Id love to go back to Montreal and I would be happy to stay in this hotel again 
N => Convenient location but not sure Id do it again   
N => Good value but has some issues  
N => il y a beaucoup mieux  
N => chambre horrible   
N => Disgusting My boyfriend at the time booked this hotel for our Valentines week holiday  He booked everything and assured me it was going to be a great place  My biggest thing is cleanliness and this place did not deliver  I was grossed out first by the washroom  We could hear people having sex loud and clear through the paper thin walls  When we found out our stove in the kitchenette didnt work we asked to be moved we had to go down the hall down the stairs out the building around the corner up the stairs and waited to be buzzed in to the lobby  You know the hotel is in an unsafe area when you have to be buzzed in to the lobby during rush hour  We were given a new room a floor up from the first  So back around the corner etc etc  When we got up to the new room the bathroom was just as grungy and the bed had pubic hairs in it  We again demanded a new room  The third room was down the hall from the original  When we tried the door it had been chained from the inside and someone said quotHelloquot from the dark  At that point I ided we were finding a new hotel Being Valentines Day we had to stay there one night as there were no other rooms to be had at a reasonable rate  The night we slept at this place I kept all my daytime clothes on for fear of touching the linens   so much for a romantic Valentines Day The next day we booked into the Travelodge which was slightly smaller but had the cleanliness standard I expect  It was only  more for the week and still close to everything  And best of all we werent given an already occupied room Moral of the Story DO Believe the bad reviews  Theyre true  
N => beware of location For the record I did not see the rooms  Once we arrived we were so turned off by the surrounding area we just ided to pony up pay some more amp go to a cleaner more ent location  Street is full of sex shops prostitutes and druggies homeless people  Just not want I want to be around when Im on vacation  Was trying to save money but its really not worth it if youre going to be scared to venture out or even not have a lobby or somewhere to hang out when youre done with the tourist thing  As far as the location the places we ended up with were just as good  Metro makes everything convinient  
N => Comfortable clean Great Price comfortable clean stay  Rooms were a bit small but the location was perfect  
N => Would not stay there again The room was painfully small and not as clean as we would have liked  The bed was very uncomfortable  The price was right and though you get what you pay for we have stayed at other places in Montreal at the same price range with better results  
N => Horrible hotel Do not stay there Do not stay at this hotel unless you like a hotel lobby that doubles as a prostitute waiting room  HORRIBLE experience 
N => Le pire h tel de notre s jour aux US  
N => Horrible exp rience  
N => Depends on your room    but great location Here are some tipsPROS  Great location downtown  Good service   Huge rooms  Free wireless if you are a select member  Good value for size of roomsetcCONS  My room was old   ensure you ask for better location rooms next to elevator very noisy  Bad experience with cleaning   I found hairs in my bathtub upon check in     gross    Very dated furniture holes in the chair stains on carpet very worn  Room service ice cold toast and egg   not good but they are fast  No air conditioning except in summer months  Couldnt find gift shop  Hotel bar was dead not much action herePics attached  
N => Good Location   Would stay again  Arrived quite early in the morning about  and the staff were very accomodating in checking us in we had been expecting to have to wait until check in time  We had booked via travelzoo and the rate included breakfast but this component of the reservation didnt seem to get into the hotel system  I had the original documentatioon from travelzoo so after approximately  minutes we were provided with the breakfast coupons The location is very good we are frequent travelers to Montreal and the hotel is close to everything downtown and the metro  Rooms were fine a bit dated but clean and the housekeeping staff assigned to our room usually had our room cleaned by early afternoon The buffet breakfast was good with a selection of hot and cold items but was a bit expensive  if it was not included with your room rate  
N => Worst Hotel Management Ive Ever Seen I completely agree with the last review  This hotel has also charged my credit card without authorization as well First of all we booked their special which included buffet breakfast for two  Upon arrival at the hotel we were told that breakfast was not included  We let it go  We had also requested smoking rooms and they had assigned us non smoking rooms  Again at check in we reiterated that we needed somking rooms to which they replied quotjust take thesequot with a wink  I dont know how youd interpret that but to me that meant just take these rooms but keep the smoking to a minimum  Within the next  days we were herassed by the hotel management on  arate occasions  The first time they complained that the smoke detectors in the room went off   we told them we had asked for smoking rooms   they still refused to put us in a new room  The second time was at  on a Friday night please note the time and day of the week and security came up to say there was a noise complaint I was alone in the room at the time and listening to music at about  of the maximum level youd get from the TV  Still I was nice enough to turn the music off  The third time security woke us up with real loud banging on the door  We opened the door and they asked us how many people are staying in the room and forced themselves in to check The th time they woke me up again apparently because my friend was smoking a Djarum Indonesian clove cigareete and said we had been given  warnings and had  minutes to vacate the premises This was the most embaressing thing I have ever endured in my life as they stood there for  minutes while we packed our stuff  I should mention that the manager refused to talk to me and didnt even know who the hotel room was registered to  She said its not under my name After  minutes she finally sent someone to check and they came back saying it was under my credit card  At this point the manager accuses us of smoking ijuana in the room Imagine the nerve on some people Needless to say we had enough and agreed to leave on the condition that we would not be paying for the rooms at all we had got very little sleep in the past  days and this was supposed to be our down time before we hit the town again on Saturday night  There were  witnesses present and the so called manager understood clearly the condition under which we agreed to leave  I just found out through my credit card company that the whole length of the stay was charged to the credit card even the nights that we didnt stay This was by far the single worst hotel experiene Ive had  In my years of travel having stayed in some amazing hotels fron NYC to Asia I had never received a warning let alone be thrown out so you can imagine how embaressins this experience was   but truthfully its Omni and its staff that should be embaressed and ashamed  
N => Do not give them a credit card Hotel parking lot is on different street to far away to be convenient  Heated winter pool on rooftop which was a bonus was Closed for reations check in is very fast and efficient stayed   for  nights booked with Hotwire and prepaid online at time of reservation At check in a credit card was requested for incidentals eg room service telephone cards Even though no food or calls were placed   was placed on credit card and still to this date   after  arate conversations with the hotel accounting department   Though very nice and polite Karinastill cannot or will not release the funds held on to buy the hotel So please take care and precautions when using a credit card  
N => Definitely coming back We loved the Omni hotel  It was very clean quick elevators walking distance to great pubs dance bars and lots of shopping The hotel has a great view of downtown Montreal  The bed was very comfortable and even with a room beside the elevator a very quiet restful stay  The parking was a bit expensive as a hidden fee but it was worth it  We will be coming back in the summer 
N => Worn dated but a quiet place to sleep  not up to usual Omni quality I booked a nonfefundable room rate on the Omni website  I was curious to see exactly what a former Four Seasons hotel was like and got exactly what I thought  The lobby is wonderful elegant  small but the feeling is of luxury  The elevators are creaky with dated electronics but again elegant I was given a room across from the elevator which is usually an issue for me with noise but once inside the room I was confident that I wouldnt hear anything and I was right  The furniture is mismatched the bed shirt was sun bleached and worn the toilet seat was missing two of the things that hold it in place when down the sink was old the counter was missing a chunk of its surface and the couch in the room was tired  The bright spot was the bed  comfy clean bright white linens  The room in Four Seasons style was quiet and noise free  I slept like a baby  Thats more important than the things I list above as problems but this hotel is tired and not up to Omni standards  
N => Never Again We stayed at the Omni Mont Royal in ust and we will never stay at another Omni again  We arrived at approx   for a Sunday reservation  We were told that our room was not ready because they had a very busy weekend and housekeeping would not be able to have our room ready for at least another hour and a half  We were then informed that the room was a quotParlor Roomquot meaning that there was a sofa bed in the room  I was under the impression that this was in addition to a regular bed but the woman at the desk informed us that this was our bed She then told us that sometimes Priceline and Expedia could be a little misleading when it came to the room description and that they also reserved the right to change the room if necessary  I have never had a problem with Expedia but this was also going to be the first and last time we use Priceline  We were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar and told to come back  Went back an hour and a half later and were told the room would not be ready for another hour The clerk was very apologetic and mgr  never came out to address the problem  The clerk told us we could go back to the bar or have free breakfast  We were only in Montreal for a short time so we werent looking to hang in the bar or lobby for hours We were told that if we wanted a room right away we could get one but the only one they could put us in had a Murphy bed and that it was a little small so we might need a roll out  At this point we were so disgusted we took the room so we could freshen up and go out and see the city  There was a dirty room service tray outside the door of the room  When we saw the Murphy bed we went back to the desk and told them we would need the roll out  The next clerk told us that there would be an additional charge Finally someone who we think was the manager came out and waved her hand suggesting that there would not be an additional charge  At this point we were so aggravated we left for dinner  When we arrived back at the hotel around  pm the dirty room service tray was still outside our door  When we woke the next day we just wanted to get out of the hotel and forgo touring the rest of the city  We left at approx   am after trying to use the room hair dryer that was stuck on low and passing that dirty room service tray outside of our room  As stated earlier Never Again Omni or Priceline 
N => Convenient Location Travelled to Montreal this past summer with my mom to watch the Rogers Cup Womens Tennis  Found the Omni to be adequate  Room was spacious enough beds were small but comfortable  Chambermaids were friendly and kept room clean Fresh new paint could make it a bit better   just a bit outdated  Pool area was ent  Wasnt aware that there was a continental breakfast until our last day   upon check in front staff didnt say much about anything  We stayed for  days  Lots of attractions nearby  St  Laurent Street was also about a  minute walk to the traditional part of Montreal   we loved that stroll  Hotel was right near the McGill University  St  Catherines is  long blocks away  Crescent Street is also about the same distance  If you walked to Old Montreal it would take you about  minutes going downhill  Subway system was very handy  In sumy we paid night which I would say was reasonable for the room we had  I certainly would have been disappointed if the room charge would have been more   Eva from Regina SK Canada 
N => Unsatisfying A comment on the other reviews saying the hotel is not five star  I doubt the hotel would claim that it was though some websites might  Its peers are more four star chains like riott and Hilton but even against that standard it falls short As other reviewers have noted this was once a Four Seasons property but that was many years ago  The fact that they never bothered to change the shower handles that have the old logo tells you how much has been invested in the property since then  The structure of the building and rooms is nice but all the accoutremonts and furnishings are lacking  Non dairy creamer and cheap coffee the tube TV was not on a rack that you could slide out of the cabinet so you had to sit opposite it in a desk chair if you wanted to watch TV  Theres no place to buy a muffin or a newspaper in the hotel  No doorman was there to help with bags  The list goes on  The bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom were large but I would not recommend staying here unless you get a very good price e g  Priceline and just want a place to sleep  
N => Omni Mont Royal   Definitely not a  star experience Stayed at the Omni Mont Royal for  nights over Canada Day holiday  We arrived at  PM after a long drive and were told that our room would not be ready for at least another hour  My wife and I were very tired but the front desk staff did not seem to care so we sat in the hotel lobby for  mins until the room was ready  Being a Select Guest member was of no use  I found this totally unacceptable   We were given a room on the backside of the hotel  The garbage trucks with their back up alarms started and AM and went until AM  Eventhough we were on the th floor the ding ding  ding of the back up alarms was loud and clearly audible  Needless to say we could not get back to sleep after  AM  Perhaps a room on the Sherbrooke St  side would have been quieter  The room itself was very nice  Bed was ok  The loveseat was quite comfortable for reading   Although the furnishings were a bit dated everything was very clean  Bathroom was nice and spacious with good amenities  There was even a bidet  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant  as there were some local places that we wanted to try  It was definitely not a  or even  star experience  I would call it a  star hotel  There are many fine  star hotels in Montreal  Currently the Omni is not one of them  If you can get a discount rate I highly reccomend the Sofitel located acrosss the street  
N => Place to Crash Two friends and I of mine ided to stay at the Omni for a friends Bachelor party in Montreal From the moment we checked in everything went great  When we arrived everything was all prepared at the front desk and it only took two minutes to be done with check in and heading up to our room Upon entering the room everything seemed very clean and the room was much larger than we expected  Ive stayed in Montreal multiple times and for the price we paid this was by far the largest room I have ever stayed in  The room was also extremely cold which was very nice as it was a very hot day in Montreal Before heading out we had a few of our friends meet us at the room for some drinks  Unfortunately security came to visit our room because we were being too loud we were all adults between the ages of   and were not acting like children not yet at least  It was pm We found this to be quite ridiculous as it was not even dark outside yet  We quieted down a bit and left the hotel around  for dinner While we were there we took a quick tour of the hotel  We found the pool to be very nice and the gym was probably the largest hotel gym I have ever seen  They also have an Amerispa on location  We didnt use any of these services but it was nice to know they were there and were very clean Overall the stay was very nice and we had no complaints  I would definitely stay there again especially if we can get the same type of rate  for the Friday night  The location is great within walking distance to anything you would want to see in Montreal and the customer service was very good  Thanks Omni  
N => Just average hotel  NO WAY  stars Everything in the the hotel is old looking   from the lobby to the rooms  The room was just alright but by no means a  star hotel  
N => Needs reation badly to be considered  star We booked the prez suite here because we couldnt get in at the W on the big UFC fight weekend  They gave us some lame excuse about how the person in their prez suite had extended their stay   and recommended the OMNI   whatever  The only thing that was nice about the room s was a big  story sitting room on the top floors which adjoined to our normal bedroom and it was close to shopping But   all the carpets needed to be replaced the furniture was cracked dented scratched bathrooms were ancient poor lighting throughout reeked of smoke from the last quotpartyquot that took place in there    I could just go on and on If you are looking for a  star experience this hotel is NOT it  
N => Pleasant stay The hotel is well situated for easy access to shopsrestaurants  Staff were pleasant and helpful especially concierge guy  Our room wasnt ready upon check in but this was no problem as our cases were securely stored and we went for lunch The room was average   in need of updating but was immaculately clean and spacious  Mini bar was expensive   even by mini bar standards All in all this hotel was fine for our needs and we loved Montreal  
N => Great location We got this great hotel at a great price  The location was phenomenal  We were close to all the shopping to the bar district and to the Forum to watch a hockey game  They have this really cool outdoor heated pool that was fun to swim in with all the snow around the pool  A couple big drawbacks was that the hot tub was being cleaned or reated or something  The other thing was the steam room was moldy  I was actually sort of scared to sit in there  However the gym was great I was really impressed with all the equipment  I got my workouts in everyday  Overall the hotel was good  
N => Great Weekend We stayed at this property two years ago and ided to stay again due to its convenient location  We werent disappointed the second time either  Join the Select Member Club its free online and you can enjoy your choice of hot and cold beverage delivered to your room every morning  The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and more than willing to help with information  We arrived quite early in the morning and although both rooms were not ready they allowed us to use one of the rooms  The concierge also helped us out with making a dinner reservation  Our TravelZoo special of  also helped with our costs  It was within walking distance to downtown sights including the Bell Centre  We wont hesitate to go back to this hotel again even though the Canadiens lost the hockey game 
N => BE CAREFUL at the Omni   An Excellent Hotel Otherwise Our stay at the Omni in Montreal was excellent   but it came at a price  First the MiniBar can become a hidden fee on your credit card unless you make sure to check all bills and get a copy of the checkout charges  We got billed for the MiniBar from the prior patron at the room  We were never told of the charges at time of checkout  And not until we returned home many many miles away and checked our credit card   that a charge for  was added  If we slipped on checking the credit card bill   we would have been at a loss  The Omni did not correct the bill immediately   because it was unable to verify the MiniBar charges were NOT ours  And because we did not have a paper copy at checkout we had less credibility  So forget the nice smiling faces and the joyous grandure front desk    make sure you get a checkout receipt of all your charges  Or else you  get charged AFTER you get back home  Dont forget    they have your credit card on file    and can charge you   Chasing this error back    to being a MiniiBar Attendand error cost us the customer two long distance phone calls conversations with family members    to make sure we did not make a mistake calls to the credit card company and emails to omni hotel  Anytime you stay at a foreign country    make sure you get all necessary documents    do not rely on nice hospitality   Everybody makes a mistake   Careful if you are traveling with Kids  They will eat the candy and not say what happened  So Omni makes sure the candy is just about the level kids can reach    and no LOCK  Both are recepit for disaster  And the patron will pay     for this trick  We were lucky not to have kids with us at this stay  But if you have kids get all the Mini Bar stuff out of the room  This is how they make extra money from people who just look at the smiles  
N => A sure bet   nothing spectacular but nothing less than flawless  I stayed at the Omni entirely by accident when my connecting flight out of YUL got cancelled and I was stuck in one of my favorite cities for a night poor me  It was a weekend during peak tourist season and the Grand Prix was in town    so it was exceedingly hard to find a room and pretty much anywhere you were bound to pay through the nose That having been said paying through the nose for an unintended layover could not have been more pleasant thanks to the Omni I had been traversing airports and oceans for nearly  hours straight and although it was a last minute reservation the front desk at the Omni took care of me quickly and very pleasantly while my bags were taken up to the room  Minutes after I got there the extra towels and toiletries I requested arrived and the concierge called up to let me know theyd managed to get me a reservation at my favorite restaurant Au Pied de Cochon    definitely check it out if you have a chance  The room was rather outdated    stuffy and old fashioned but large and well maintained  After seeing the damage inflicted by three airports on the wine I had packed note to self invest in hardshell case I had the hotel send up some paper towels and garbage bags for me to clean up    also delivered promptly given the slow elevators  After taking care of this and washing a days worth of air travel off of me I lay down on the bed and fell promptly to sleep  The bed was very comfortable though not the best Ive had but more importantly the room was a silent as a tomb  Needless to say I slept past my dinner reservation  Room service was adequate but below what Id expect from a  star hotel  I have yet to get a good asian meal in Montreal though so perhaps the Omni is not uniquely culpable All in all I cant think of any major flaw with the Omni here    the room was excellent but the service really ked it as a top quality hotel  I dont think Ive ever been quite as needy on a hotel stay but nor have I been so graciously accomodatedIt is not a terribly memorable hotel and will disappoint anyone looking for the latest in design and amenities    but the Omni does exactly what a good hotel should do and does so with aplomb  On my most recent stay to Montreal this time in the off season the Omni was running only night more than a budget hotel and I dont think Ive ever regretted not spending extra money so much before A sure bet and a serene oasis in Montreal  
N => Good but not great ent hotel  Nothing stellar but certainly adequate  Excellent location near the busy Rue St  Catherine  The bed was very comfortable  My non smoking room smelled faintly of smoke  No in room electronic safe which was a big minus for me  
N => Excellent stay After reading so many poor reviews I was worried about our upcoming stay at the Omni  We got a great deal on Priceline but werent sure what to expect  We were given a corner king room an hour earlier than the usual check in time   it was lovely spacious super comfortable bed nice big windows  The front desk staff were real helpful pool very nice location awesome   really we have no complaints  A first class hotel experience  
N => Poor Service  Noisy Room The service at this hotel was poor from the moment we arrived  Although we arrived at pm versus a  check in time we were told that our room wasnt ready and quotmightquot not be ready for another hour  The desk staff was in no way sensitive to our situation we were traveling with a yr old who needed to nap and it took us  minutes to have our request to speak to a manager honored even though he walked by  times  The manager did little to help beyond give us some attitude tell us the room would be ready in  minutes offer us a drink at the bar very practical with a yr old and then offer us free breakfast  The concierges advice with respect to restaurants travel times and the weather report was poor  The quality of breakfast and room service was weak by  star hotel standards  It took the hotel staff  minutes to check us out because they couldnt figure out how to let us pay in part with excess CAD we had  Adding insult to injury was the fact that the hotel manager walked by us as his staff was visibly having trouble checking us out and saiddid nothing One of the bigger problems with this hotel was the noise level  We had read about this in other reviews on this site and figured it really couldnt be that bad  As an extra precaution we asked for a quiet room  We unfortunately were put in front of the elevator though I dont think another room would have made a difference  I dont know if it is the quality of construction or proximity to McGill but the room was very loud at night  You can hear every car ambulance school party and person in the hallway  Do not ignore this if you want a quiet hotel 
N => Terrible service My experience at this hotel was terrible from the moment my boyfriend and I walked up to the front desk  We booked our room through Orbitz and apparently the room had one single bed even though the reservation was for two people  The front desk person said that since we booked through Orbitz there was nothing she could do except to offer us an upgrade the upgrade was for  additional per night   thanks Bao Thankfully we managed to booked a different hotel down the street but unfortunately I left my watch behind  I called  minutes after leaving the hotel and left a message with the security desk  Since no one returned our call after three hours we ided to walk there and had the concierge contact the security desk  After  minutes of waiting in the lobby the person in charge of security came up and told us that he could not find anything in the room and that he contacted the cleaning staff and nothing was found  He said he would leave a message to the person coming in at P and that heshe will follow up with us  We are back in the US two days after this happened and no call from the Omni yet   thanks Antonio  How can a  star hotel get such a rating with such poor customer service I was glad to know that customer service is a priority at other hotels but apparently not at the Omni  
N => Nice staff ent location but      Stayed at the Omni last week     very nice and polite staff at reception  I requested a quotvery quietquot room  I was put up on the th floor in a corner room  Room was over a stop light on a pretty busy corner      I am not a light sleeper but I do wake up when a car engine blasts through the window    all night long the noise from the street made it impossible to sleep  Montreal night clubs are open until am and people then drive around looking for more fun so the noise level died down only around am am where I did manage to get an hour of sleep  Their windows only quotseemquot to be single paned so that does cause a problem  In the room there was a side window that had a wooden type shade used for coverage     light was able to seep through to light up the entire room    they use a blackout curtain for the large window which does a great job but its useless as this side window allows the light to shine through and there is nothing that can be done  I tried to rig up one of the blankets for coverage but this did not work yes it did feel like I was on a hidden camera show   haha     I called to complain about noise and was given a room that looked over the courtyardswimming pool     definitely do this when you book as the noise from the cars goes away   the only thing is that their was a huge garbage dumpster back there that got emptied around am so that will wake you up as well  This room also had a small window with the wooden shades so it was impossible to make the room dark in the morning there as well  In regard to noise from other rooms you can hear doors closeslam all night long as well  Conversations in the hallway easily penetrate the room door  This place was obviously not designed to keep the noise out of its rooms    one plus though is that there were no foot steps from above  Besides that    location is about a  minute walk to Old Montreal and the Port    easy enough to do  Also very close by to Dorchester Square where many tours begin  The normal room service was pricey but they do have a Chinese restaurant below that offers room service with great foodhuge portions for reasonable prices  Get the Salmon in Black Bean sauce for  and the Singapore Noodles with Pork and Shrimp for      you will be happy  Would I stay here again Probably not as sleep is pretty important to me when I stay at a hotel   haha  
N => Pleasant Stay at the Omni We were not sure where to stay in Montreal  There are many choices  We were very happy we chose the Omni  The room was lovely with a beautiful view of the city  It was just the right size and very clean  The staff was pleasant and helpful  The location perfect  When returning to Montreal we will stay at the Omni  Thank you  
N => Excellent Stay I booked a hotel room online  It was about  bucks  I didnt have high expectations   however I was pleasantly surprised on my arrival  We arrived at  much earlier than the regular check in time  It was a quick check in  I had paid for a deluze room but I think we ended up getting a premium room  The room was gorgeous spaciuos clean and had a huge window  The view on the th floor overlooked the pool and buildings   nothing special but it was still nice to have a view cause I dont think I was supposed to get one  Everything is close to this hotel  We mostly walked everywhere however the taxi isnt expensive to take  We dined at a seafood place on St Laurant street   it was the best seafood Ive ever eaten My boyfriend and I got the dinner for two which was I think was  bucks  In total our meal came to  bucks with wine  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and the restaurant we ate at  
N => The Unfortunate Truth It saddens me to write this but after reading the glowing reviews I began to question whether I stayed at the same hotel as my fellow reviewers  Having stayed here several times in the past we were looking forward to a return visit four years later Although there is really not much of a lobby to speak of it was clean and had a few chairs and tables but certainly nothing that would invite you to spend any time there  The carpet in our room was quite stained and dirty  I needed to plug in an electrical appliance and was disgusted at what I found behind the headboard along with years of dust  The one sitting chair was stained and the furniture scratched and chipped  The beds were quite uncomfortable although the comforter and sheets were way above average perhaps to disguise the rundown beds The front desk although courteous seemed understaffed and abrupt  Several times throughout our stay I was put on hold only to give up after five minutes and recall  Calling the concierge I found them to be friendly however they needed to refer me to the front desk as they could not address my questions The bellman was very pleasant but told me he needed  cash to park the car overnight  I also tipped him five dollars for taking my suitcase out of the car and  to a second bellman who brought it to my room The kids were excited to take a swim in the pool only to find out that it was closing in five minutes  p m   The following morning we did go down to the pool and found it to be very quotkid unfriendlyquot consisting of three roped off lap lanes clearly designed to cater to the gym crowd  The swim tunnel had chewing gum stuck in various places in the plexiglas was so scratched and dirty it was hard to see through  Although I did not use the gym I did walk through and notice all of the usual machines seemingly in good order Unfortunately I did use the mens locker room and found it to be in less than acceptable condition  The hotel apparently derives additional revenue by opening this up for local gym membership to the outside as   of the lockers had padlocks on them  The showers appeared moldy the ceiling stained doors under the sink unhinged hair dryers caked with soap and old shaving cream a feeble attempt at putting out a few paper cups for mouthwash some combs one can of shaving cream but no razors one scale and it was broken no additional towels other than the undersized frayed towel issued at the check in desk  I could go on and on     the entire facility seemed old neglected and dirty  On the day of our departure we attempted to get a late check out and were told that the hotel was sold out for that evening  In the end they did reluctantly tell us that we could stay until  p m  keyword being reluctantly As we did not have much luggage to begin with we carried our own bags down to the car and found that it was just as well since there appeared to be only one bellman who was attempting to help  different people Overall this hotel in my opinion is in need of some immediate attention  A smiling doorman and a pleasant concierge do not make a four star hotel  
N => Beware the parlor room I booked a room for  online for the Omni in Montreal  It was a good rate compared to other hotels listed as  stars  When we arrived the man at the check in desk who turned out to be the manager informed us that we had booked a quotparlor roomquot which had a sofa bed  If we wanted a room with a proper bed we would have to pay an additional taxes per night  We ided to check out the room  The room was filled with furniture   table and chairs coffee table lounge suitedresser TV armoire   but for a bed there was a cot  The cot was  feet wide and not big enough for   We went back to check in and asked that they give us a room that was suitable for two people  When my wife politely asked why we were sentto a room that clearly sleeps one the manger asked her why she was being rude to him  This was not the type of response that we expectedbased on the hotels description of itself and its service  After  minutes of front desk confusion we were sent to another room  This time with a pull out sofa bed  We accepted this room mainly because we were late for a show we had booked  This bed was terrible  The mattress is very thin and bowed toward the center  Springs poked into my back  I should have slept on the floor  After a lousy nights sleep I am looking into my options  We booked and pre paid for  nights but if I can get my money back for the remaining nights I am leaving I am a frequent traveler and have never encountered beds like these in a  star hotel  I think most travelers would agree that the two top criteria for a room would be quotclean room and bathroomquot and quotcomfortable bedquot  I do not understand why the Omni chose to fill these rooms with superfluous furniture and leave out the most important part   a comfortable bed I looked again on line and the description of the quotparlor roomquot was indeed parlor with sofa bed  I naively assumed that any beds in a so called luxury hotel would have been acceptable  Caveat emptor I would avoid this hotel because of its beds and its poor service  Instead of trying to offer a better solution the manager tried to up sell us on another room  If I had known that the beds were so terrible when I was booking I would have factored in the additional night to get a ent bed and booked elsewhere  
N => Omni was so so Overall I was not impressed by this hotel  I was told that I would be able to check in early prior to my arrival  I arrived at pm and was unable to check in until pm  The room was spacious although or was a little dated  The bathroom was a good size  The only other positive was that we received a complimentary upgrade and free drink service in the morning Now the rest of the story    this is a very noisy hotel  I was situated on the th floor and could clearly hear the noise from the streets below throughout the night We also awoke at  am to sounds of several drunk people on our floor  This is not something that could have been controlled by the hotel but added to an overall average experience  Parking is close to the hotel but not connected to the hotel and did not find a direct connection to the hotel There are other very good hotels in Montreal that are well priced including Le Centre Sheraton and the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth  Having stayed in Montreal several times I would recommend the above two over the Omni Mont Royal  
N => Nice but not complete luxury The hotel was nice but a little disappointing  The room was large but was quite dirty   not acceptable for a quotluxurious hotel quot Location was nice but would not stay here again   would go to the Fairmont or Ritz instead for the price  
N => Great Stay Our stay was il amp th and after encountering horrible weather conditions and a long drive we were thankful to finally reach our destination and was looking forward to relaxing at the Omni  Front desk was friendly  check in was speedy and our request for a kingbedhighfloorcity viewsmoking was honored  We are a select member and the extra touches are greatly appreciated       morning beveragechocolate treat newspaperturn down service with weather report and chocolates  We were on the th floor and the city view was velous  we moved our couch across from the window and enjoyed the night skyline   Room wasnt huge but it had a couchdesk tv armoire coffee maker table large round table and one chair  Mini bar was used as a bed night table    clever use of space  King bed was very comfortable with a nice down blanket cozied between two sheets  Bathroom was basic but very clean with an added bidet perhaps hahaha could have been for the guys to use  Im just not sure  We took advantage of the outdoor pool the next morning as it was a nice sunny day  A dip in the hot tub afterwards was just what we needed The spagym pool area is quite nice especially the locker room that carries the little extras such as shaving foams hairspray body deodorants and washes  cotton balls q tips  hair dryer etc to use after a workout The only downfall was at the time of check in they ran out of minibar keys which we could have used after our drive however we just scooted to the bar and had a drink there instead and forgot to ask for one on our way back to the room Also  we didnt receive bathrobes which I could have put to use but no biggy  Our room was very clean and service all around was great  Its those little touches mentioned above that make the Omni a wonderful place to stay in my opinion  On leaving    the doorman was very informative on directions and I left feeling like I should just turn around and check back in again  I will make sure to book a spa treatment before I arrive next visit so its already on my schedule  Never enough time  
N => Very Comfortable Hotel Similar experience to other reviewers i e  booked through Expedia requesting double room smoking  Booked  months in advance and confirmed with hotel  days before arriving but on arrival where given twin bedded room  Explanation from receptionist is that they are advised number of rooms to hold for internet customers but are not aware of bed situation  So it depends on what rooms are available on the day you arrive Evenutally we were given double bedded room which was very comfortable and spotlessly clean as was the bathroom  Eating and drinking in the Hotel is quite expensive as is Room ServiceMini Bar  Buffet breakfast Can  each plus taxes   plus service charge    In Montreal City all service charge is   not   as expected  For Breakfast you should go to EGG Spectation about  blocks away on Maisonneuve Street   ask at Hotel for directions as advised in previous report  Excellent food eggs of every description crepes etc  Very reasonably priced from Can  Otherwise loads of little coffee houses on every street  We went to Chez Coras also but Egg Spectation better choice  Restaurant for evening   go to Vargas Steakhouse Sushi Bar on Rene Levesque  Complimentary Car over and back to your hotel again  Check with front desk in hotel they will do all the organising  Oh dont forget the tip  Actually hotel has the menus of different restaurants so you can ide there and then where you want to go  We had no problems whatsoever with the Omni Mont Royal once we got our bedroom that was requested  One other point if you book your hotel room through internet sources you are unable to claim back Global Tax Refund    If you book directly with the hotel yourself by phone or email you can claim  Also any goods you buy value over Can net taxes each item you are able to claim back   tax  Go to Eaton Center th Floor when in the City Center and get your refund there amp then once you show your return ticket out of Canada also bring your passport  Worth checking out if you intend shopping  Overall I would definately stay in Mont Royal beside Peel Metrolocation excellent for City shopping sight seeing or whatever  Taxi fromto airport is standard Can   Make sure to check beforehand  
N => Stay At The Omni Youll LOVE It My husband and I stayed at the Omni Mont Royal in Montreal for  nights in ch   I must admit that I was a bit hesitant as I booked it through Expedia and had never used their service before  I actually only booked for  nights and we were prepared to look elsewhere if we were disappointed with the accommodaitons  I also wondered if wed be given a room of less quality because of booking through Expedia  We were so pleased  From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty  The staff was very friendly helpful and couldnt do enough for us  The very nice young lady on the front desk suggested we take a room on a high floor facing the city as the view was quite nice  Actually the view was absolutely breathtaking Our room was immaculate the or was gorgeous and the bathroom was huge  We were given our own bathrobes the bed was made up with a duvet and every night when we got back to our room after a day of sightseeing wed find a light left on for us and our bed was turned down  So nice to feel pampered Needless to say we extended our stay at the Omni  We travel quite a bit and I will not hesitate to book our next hotel through Expedia as their rates are more than reasonable  This hotel surpassed our expectations and we wouldnt want to stay anywhere else while visiting Montreal  
N => Poor Customer Service Although the Mont Royal is a lovely hotel in a great location they dont know much about customer service  I had booked the hotel about  months in advance through Expedia and specifically asked for a room with two beds since I was traveling with my Mom  I had even called the hotel two weeks prior to my reservation to confirm my request as well as ask for an early check in  When we arrived they gave us a room with a king sized bed  I explained that I had requested a room with two beds months in advance they explained they had no rooms available  In addition I asked if they could send up a cot and was told they had no cots available either  I asked if they could contact me if a room opens up or cots become available and was told that I should check in with them  Well no room became available nor any cots  POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE 
N => Loved the Omni We just returned from four days in beautiful Montreal  Our stay at the Omni could not have been better  Our room   was very large and very clean  Bonus was we had a great view  The hotel staff could not have been nicer or more helpful  We would stay here again and recommend it to anyone  They have a great gym and a heated outdoor pool  Check out is  oclock but they will hold your luggage till you leave  If you fill out the select guest form on line they will bring you coffee and juice free at your requested time  
N => overrated hotel We recently booked a low rate for the Omni US and were somewhat dissatisfied with the experience  The high speed internet connection did not work much of the time and was not high speed when it did work  We also needed to change rooms twice first because our quotmountain viewquot was really stareing into the Best Western across the street  Then the next room smelled strongly of smoke  So check in took ouer an hour not my idea of a first rate hotel  
N => Great standard rooms Very satisfied  The standard rooms are very big and clean  We came during low season so they were very accomodating  When we requested a room higher up with a better view the receptionist even apologized for not giving us that room first  Serivce was great  
N => better than average but not a  star I stayed at the Omni three nights in e  it was chosen by a company thart was holding a conference I attended The location is just perfect  The shopping malls and other interesting sites in walking distance  Not to far away fromt the subway  great The lobby seems a bit small  The front desk wasnt helpfull all the time  On checkout I asked the lady to include the breakfast in the room price  She told me its impossible  No second effort no asking of somebody who might know how it works  In European hotels this is not a big issue they do it all the time with no complains Well  The breakfast was buffet style  a little too much for what they offer  Eggs that swim in water french toast as dry as carpet and a small selection of yoghurts and fruits  And tons of paistries Coffee was measured by European standards great  They offer Douwe Coffee which is a traditional dutch brand  very aromatic The room was furnished in a pretty conservative not to say old way  The AC had two modes On and Off  No seletion of power  That is a bit weak  The rest of the room was average  The bathroom was pretty worn out  The gym on third floor was great for weightlifting kies like me  They offer a huge variety of free weights dumbells barbells a bench press several cardio machines  That is pretty good The conference room wasnt chilled by an AC so it was pretty humid and warm in there  That wasnt fun  Sound was great seating was a bit old school  Not to comfortable for two days of nonstop conferencing  The snacks they served between the sessions were good so was the coffee Overall I would say it was ok but not spectacular  
N => Good deal if you get it through Priceline My friend and I stayed at the Omni from e nd to th  We got it through Priceline for about half of rack rate  Since there were two of us I called the hotel over two weeks prior right after I booked the room through Priceline to make sure that we have a room with two double beds  Upon arrival we were told that they have no record of it and they would have to look for a room with two beds for us  When they did find one we were told that it wont be available until  to pm  We just drove over  hours from Toronto and wasnt exactly in the best conditions  But we just shrugged it off and walked around downtown until pm  The room was nice and ent size and the beds were comfortable  We had a downtown facing view and was on the st floor so there was no noise problem  Unlike some posters earlier we did get the complimentary newspapers which we didnt really read anyway  The Wifi internet was probably the best part since it worked perfectly  Too bad it wasnt warmer when we were there because we did use the pool which was nice but it was too cold once you get out of the water  Our experience with the concierge was generally OK  We only asked for directions to the casino and the area Outremont and not much else since I have been to Montreal numerous times before and their driving directions got us there without much problem As far as parking we parked one nights in the underground lot attached to the hotel and paid I believe around  Cdn  Beware that the posted rate is for a  hour period only  Then the next day parked next door at the open lot for  Cdn  But you need to get up at am to move the car Because otherwise they would charge you for another time period  That was not a pleasant experience since we were out late til am the night before  As for the hotel it was good for what we paid for but to be honest I didnt really notice much of a difference between staying at the Omni or the Holiday Inn near Chinatown  
N => Tired old hotel in need of refurbishment Stayed here on a priceline deal for two nights  I have to say that despite the cheap price this hotel falls firmly in the quotprobably used to be a luxurious hotel  years agoquot but has long past its best time  Carpets are dirty and furnishings are old  The bathroom fittings are still from its time as a Four Seasons  Our room was large but the bathroom was surprisingly small  Although we were on a non smoking floor you could smell smoke through the AC unit  I recommend joining the Omni Select Guest program before staying at the hotel as you get a free drink in the morning as a treat  A newspaper should also be included but we never received ours During our stay we also had a problem with a power outage in our hotel and all in all the service was efficient but not overly friendly  The beds were very comfortable however and the location was perfect for downtown Montreal McGill university etc  but there are so many nice and new hotels in both downtown and Old Montreal that I would not particularly recommend staying at the Omni Mont Royal  
N => Total Disappoi ntment Upon our arrival at  pm well after check in time we were told that our room was not ready and that we should sit in the lobby while our room was cleaned  I dont think so When I asked them to give us another room I was told it was the only one of its type available whereby I suggested that they had  choices     they could upgrade the room   they could call the manager   we could go to another hotel  They found the equivalent room on a higher floor One day we returned from sightseeing to find that the beds had been made but that was about all   the coffee pot and used cups were left dirty the ice bucket was brimming with melted ice instead of being emptied and replaced with a new plastic bag one of the used terry robes supplied by the hotel had been removed and not replaced On the first night of our stay when we had inquired at the Concierge desk about restaurants in the area we were given the names of some restaurants but little else and it was my opinion that the concierges behind the desk were unprofessional and not well versed in what was available  We live in Boston where on several occasions I have been in hotel lobbies and overheard the concierges giving information to guests in a thorough and professional manner  Montreal is supposed to be a sophisticated city As it turns out I do not believe that Concierge is a regular position at the Onmi Mont Royal rather I think the people at the Front desk rotate to the Concierge desk because one of the people with whom I spoke about the poorly cleaned room was behind the concierge desk on the last night of our stay and actually gave us INCORRECT information pretty much ruining our evening We had asked if there was a restaurant atop one of the hotels where we could see a view of the city as we had done in Quebec City  She gave us the name of the Delta Hotel where she had said we would be able to have a drink and dessert since we had already eaten dinner which we had seen others do at a similar venue in Quebec City  However when we arrived at the Delta we were told that such was not the case that there was only a complete buffet dinner served leaving us without a plan for the evening Montreal is known to be a city with lots of jazz   with a yearly jazz festival   and when we requested some venues the same quotConciergequot supplied us with only  locations and little information about what was offered at each To top everything off   there was a power outtage on the last night of our stay  The hotel lost power for   to  hours depending upon with whom you spoke  As a result we were forced to leave the room earlier than planned and before we were really ready to leave  Nothing worked and a horrendous noise was blaring from the loudspeaker  By way of explanation we were later told that the electric company had cut a cable  The Omni was the only hotel affected In all fairness we were given complimentary continental breakfast one morning and reimbursed for the taxi fares to the Delta and back plus some compensation for poor service but the loss of power they considered to be quotan act of God quot When we received our bill they had overcharged us  per night above the contracted rate The explanation for the overcharge was that the rate quothad just jumped upquot to which I replied that if anything the rate should have quotjumped down quotIn short I would not recommend this hotel to anyone   and how anyone could give it the  star review upon which I based my ision to stay at the Omni Mont Royal is beyond me  Be advised that it is a   star hotel with    star prices  
N => Cushy Beds Upscale Bath Products Great Service Wonderful Location This is the third or fourth time Ive had the fortune to stay at this hotel  Overall it gets better each time with a few exceptions that when presented to senior management were remedied diligently and thoughtfully Arriving early on a Friday morning I expected to leave my bags and continue my day in Montreal  Instead the top notch clerk at the reservations desk had me checked into my room before I could even blink my eyes  And some room this was the old style bathrooms with large tubs and superior toiletries ranked second to the heavenly five star bedding that enveloped one in the best nights sleep I had in years  Timing was key I had buried my father the week before and my exhaustion was acute  This was the cure  There was an incident not properly corrected by middle management when brought to the attention of her superiors I was more than satisfied  The concierge staff was well equipped to answer questions room service timely and attentive and the laundry service first rate  The doormen could pay a bit more attention to those of us arriving by means other than automobiles   especially women  While they shot to attention when well dressed mencouples arrived either by foot or taxi their response was lukewarm when I arrived and departed frequently the first day  Overall this was a true value and a place that makes a difference for a traveler  
N => Frustrating I bid USD on priceline and was able to get this hotel  I would not have paid a dime more   They have no parking  Despite what was advertised  We ended up going to a lot across the street at Scotia Bank   a night as opposed to the drunkard at the riot lot who tried to charge  a night and KEEP the keys to my car  I lived in Montreal for many years and know that both lots are overpriced but it was cold and i didnt want to walk very far I was a guest selects member and never received any of the rewards  Like the paper and a beverage in the morning   The maid tried to enter our room several times at AM despite the fact that our chain was on stopping her   obviously indicating that people were in the room  We felt rushed to vacate the room so that she could clean   despite the fact that we were there for two nights   RANDOM CHARGES  I noticed some random unsubstantiated charges at checkout  brought them to the attention of the man doing our checkout who assured me that they were a quotmistakequot but somehow    despite his assurance they still wound up coming out of my checking account  I would like to report them for fraud  HOWEVER     The fitness facility was very nice  Rooms were clean and large  
N => Beware of Omni Mont Royal Local trip advisors had warned that this property was previously a Four Seasons but did not meet their standards and was changed to an Omni property  I do not think it is up to the Omni standards either  I have stayed at Omni Hotels in Austin Dallas Cancun amp have placed people in the Omni in Houston all are luxury properties that are maintained to that standard  The Omni Mont Royal does not come close to matching that From the torn amp tattered carpet and scratched furniture in the rooms to poorly maintained common areas this would struggle to meet most national chains standards  The quothealth clubquot facilities is an odd arrangement of various rooms filled with antiquated equipment and the restaurant is much too small for a hotel this size  I  have been influenced by the surroundings but the staff also seemed tattered and many individuals commented how tired they were  The hotel was so bad that I checked out after one night and continued my stay in Montreal at the Sofitel Hotel across the street  
N => WARNING   The Pool is Closed While you would never know it from its very misleading website the pool at the Omni in Montreal is CLOSED The website shows photos of a beautiful pool  Upon check in last week we mentioned how much we were looking forward to it and they said it was closed until summer We were rather peeved given the pool was a major reason for booking the hotel They had arrangements with a club across the street to use their pool   but at  per day per person we thought this was unreasonable So if you like to swim dont stay here 
N => OK if you get a good price I stayed in a strangely shaped room on the th floor  It was a ent size had a sofa too  The or in the rooms was a little odd Red      but the bathroom was large  piece yes thats a bidet  Only thing I didnt understand was why a  star luxury hotel had quot TVs in the rooms  If Ramadas can have quot tvs and charge night why not Omni I didnt come to Montreal to watch TV but come on Staff was very friendly even tho Im just a  year old punk haha and the location is great a block from the metro and shopping  Even tho there are only  elevators to serve a  storey building they were lightning quick  This hotel opened in  as the Four Seasons and is still in good shape just a little disappointing for the rates they charge  
N => hotel fine service ok the strike was still on during our recent stay at the omni  the street noise was loud and parking was horrendous  the hotel was nice and our room was fairly nice but nothing special really makes this hotel stand out  we received service at the cafe every morning i would consider quotcordialquot  no one really went out of their way to be too nice  except for one man who got us out of a bind with the parking problem  as far as location it was within walking distance of everywhere downtown  not sure if we would stay here again simply because it was so noisy and congested  
N => Omni hotel on Strike here Beware I stayed her from     I never witnessed a hotel I stayed at b that was striking no room service nor mini bar available  Im an Omni member free beverage morning drink delivered to your room granted I enjoyed my stay here though I was a little disappoint by the on going strike I had to ASKED to be made adjusted since I was on vacation amp each time I passed by the strikers felt sorry for them  I paid through priceline but was given full buffet bfast each morning   this price is  CAD plus taxes  I wasnt disappt  either   the room were cleaned good each day entertainmentbell captain service was excellent  Was told for good steak ampseafood to go to Vargas restaurant very expensive but very good Near everything metro underground shopping mall the spa Amerispa lower level was good   had a massage amp facial   the pool was a good size as well as the gym amp whirlpool EXCELLENT Zen restaurant is chinese never ate there   The bed sleep ever sooo good quiet hallways not alot of kids here  the bar area was dead the whole wkend    Rebuen Rest  within walking distance good excellent staff at the hotel     would I return here if ever in Montreal again YESS 
N => Upgraded at the Omni We arrived in Montreal and checked in at the Omni at noon  Unfortunately our room was not available but that was not unusal since check in is at pm  They asked if we had luggage and that they would hold it for us while we went sight seeing  When we came back the room we had booked was not available and without even a pause they upgraded us to a ior suite  It was fantastic Especially since we paid the discounted rate for a deluxe room from the Montreal tourism website go under last minute deals and you will save  We were on the th floor and my one year old dhter had plenty of space to walk explore and play  It was perfect  There was a strike going on at the time and therefore no room service for food was available but housekeeping was still available  The staff was quite pleasant and attentative  We self parked our car for  CAD and used the Metro to get everywhere  You are at the Peel Metro stop  If you want you can valet for CAD with unlimited access to going in and out of the garage  Many restaurants surround the area  We went to Le Taj on Stanley which was good and child friendly  We also went to many restaurants that were out of the way such as in Plateau Mont Royal and Montreal Sud  It is worth exploring Montreal  It is a fantastic city and this hotel made our stay memorable  
N => Great ServiceWorn Room The hotel had excellent service and is in a convenient location  However the room was worn  Torn wallpaper scratched and dented frurniture  Room service linens had holes  I want to note the room was clean even though it needed updating  While location was convenient it was not pretty  I would pick another hotel based on the condition of the room  
N => great place to stay Just spent  nights at the Omni  I used to live in Montreal therefore picked the Omni for its central location can walk to shopping and dining VERY easily  I usually dont like too quotfancyquot a hotel but this was upscale without attitude  The rooms were very comfortable and the staff were super friendly and helpful  The best was that we NEVER were bothered by a maid but had a spotless room    where was she hiding how did she know when we left I highly recommend this hotel 
N => Staff location and amenities all  star A great location on Sherbrooke St  close to shopping and good dining  Room was clean well orated and the hotel was quiet overall  The fitness facilities were top notch and the staff were helpful but a bit stiff  A business class hotel with conventions seems to be their ket  The rates quoted by the hotel were   off season but you can get much better prices at expedia or travelocity  I used hotels and had a very unsatisfactrory experience  I booked my room about three weeks before arrival and they charged my card immediately  What seemed odd is that they did not send by booking to the Omni until two days before my arrival  
N => Room with no bed This place  be good but beware They gave me a room with a sofa side chair dining room table  chairs and living room furniture no dressers  One notable item not in the room was a bed  It looks like theywere putting people in both rooms of a two room suite suite and locking the door between When I complained they refused to give me a room with a bed insiting that I use the pull out sofa  They said that when you reserve that yourchoice of bedding type was just a preference and they could give you any quotrun of housequot room including rooms with only sofabeds  I had to fight with them to get a refund of my prepaid reservation and I took my business elsewhere Le Meridien  They acted surprised that someone would find a fault with such a room and were completely unapologetic Hey there other rooms  be nice but why take a chance with this place You too  end up with a room with no bed  The last thing you need when coming off a long flight is to deal with this sort of inconvienience and you are paying a premium to stay here  
N => Highly recommended We stayed at this hotel Valentines Day  and were very satisfied    especially for the  US we paid on Priceline  Our accomodations were luxurious  The health club and heated pool a bonus  Only only complaint is that the staff seemed a little disinterested and did not respond to problems as they promised  We asked to have a burned out light replaced  They said theyd take care of it but did not  We asked for a cot but it was never delivered  
N => All in all clean and o k  but very loud I stayed for six nights at the Omni  Staff was very helpful the room was very spacious and always clean  The interior of the room was not quite my taste I guess my grandma would have loved it  I missed the individual character of Montreals Le Germain or Les Armes to be honest I think it was boring  One thing was very annoying My room was on th floor facing Rue Sherbrooke and the noise of the traffic was really loud even with closed windows  I dont wake up easily but I had to use earplugs  AC didnt really heat up the room  All in all Id say the Omni was pretty o k  but for what I paid Ill go somewhere else next time  
N => More than I expected Spent seven nights at the Omni while attending a conference at McGill University  Received a discounted rate as a conference attendee so expected quotdiscountedquot accommodations i e  expected the hotels bottom line lowest standard room  Could not believe that the quotbottom line lowest standard roomquot bordered on luxury  Was absolutely delighted  HUGE room lovely or outstanding and prompt room service gracious personnel from the reservations staff to the itorial staff  The bed was to die for as were the feather pillows  Wouldnt even consider staying anywhere else if I return to Montreal  If I HAD to find something to complain about it would be that the cleaning people were a little too zealous   wanted to clean the room twice a day 
N => Omini Mont Royal Just Right  
N => Oui to the Omni  
N => An excellent place to stay  
N => Jadore cet hotel et le service  
N => So unbeilevably awful So we get there and theyre like quotIm sorry the room youve booked the one with two full sized beds is too dirty so we cant let you stay therequot  Things happen we understand but we assumed that wed either A receive an upgrade at no additional charge for our inconvenience or B receive a downgrade but at a hefty discount  What happened is we received a downgrade to one full sized bed and a cot they knocked  off the price  However if we had booked the same room in advance it would have been  cheaper  We were a little irked but we were still willing to give the hotel a go So we get up to the room which is fairly dirty but not any real horror drop our stuff there and go out for the night  Its a bit of a walk to downtown Montreal but it wasnt that bad  Come that night me and my friend took off our clothes to put on pajamas and left our clothes in the bathroom  When we woke up the next morning all our clothes were soaked  We dont know if the toilet ran or there was a leak or what but it was disgusting  Would not ever stay there again would never recommend to a friend will avoid at all costs  
N => It takes two to tango Filthy Room and Dishonest Management The room so called Superior room is a crowded and dark  years of havent been vacuumed carpet room with a filthy bathroom no word can accurately describe its actually condition We booked  superior room and were given only one superior room with one so called standard room which is much worse than the superior room  We ided that we should cancel that room and were promised the refund would be in the morning  WELL that never happened  The excuses were the manager wasnt there and we called later the manager was on vacation  And we finally get to him to only be confirmed that we will never get our refund back for that one room whether we like it or not So no please do not put yourself nor your loved ones into this kind of situation as I mistakenly did  Desperate or not you are better off in your car or in an airport  
N => Nighte On Park Avenue This quotHotelquot is probably the most atrocious place I have ever had the misfourtune of visiting upon arrival there was an employee surfing Porn in plain open view of the public then we were told we had reserved an quotEcomony Roomquot in the basement which we knew already but when we entered the room it was crawling with ants and absolutly filthy when i complained the front desk clerk had to be convimced to move us to another room on the second floor which turned out to be just as bad as the first room    minus the ants   the room was filthy and stained the shower was full of mold and som chunky substance which I gag when I think of   it was oximatly  am and we didnt know what to do we were told this was the best they had     after a sleepless night staring at a filthy room we checked out and had to argue to get our money back for the nd night which we were made to pay in advance and had no intention of staying the second night the manager was rude and argumentative and really didnt care about us or our situation  After threatening to call the police we were begrugingly refunded for  night  I can honestly say this is the worst of the worst    no parking and no concern for guests    Stay away from this place and hopefully they will be forced to clean this place up or do the world a favor and advertise it as it is A DUMP 
N => Terrible place to stay We had initially booked a room at the Hotel Park Avenue for a few nights through the hotel Website  We had selected the place due to its location   walking distance to our hospital  This was actually an expensive place to stay if you factor the remote parking that the hotel recommended to us there is no hotel parking  Staff was cordial but we discovered small and smelly hallways no elevators and a standard room which we found dirty smelly small old noisy   poor acoustic insulation the bathroom especially was the size of a closet and terrible  After sleeping for only  or  hours during our first night there we moved on to something better for the other nights  Someone please reate or tear this place down soon  It is just not worth staying at the Hotel Park Avenue when you can stay at a  star hotel a few blocks away for just a few dollars more per night  and get a good nights sleep  
N => Something out of the Twilight Zone I have never in my life felt so uneasy as I entered a hotel in my life Booking from Hotels com has usally been easy the hotels are genrally ent and you get what you pay for   not hereFrom the minute we pulled up in front of the hotel we new we were in an episode of the Twilight Zone The buzzer entry should have given it away   the stentch as you walked into the building and up the s style carpet stairway indicated to us that we had made a huge mistakeThe receptionist who incidently could look at both me and my fiance with each eye as they were facing totally opposite directions met us at the top of the stairs yelling out quotAre you the inspectorsquot I think that is similar to asking if we were police investiators while wolfing down his sandwich He proceeded to change our reservation room from what he called a Supreme Suite room  to some crappy off in the corner replacement room  and told us room  was not clean yet check in is at pm no What also should have indicated to us that we were not in the right spot was the well dressed foreign business man who came walking down the stairs wth a grin on his face   at pm I might add   We got our key which was an actual key and not a card and told the guy we wanted to check out the room he gave us first  Well I think my bedroom at home is bigger and the bed was a super single right next to te entrance of the room   we did not have to look any further we booked it out of there bfore you could say quotpass the saltquotWe called hotels com and they were gracious enough to offer to cover the costs the hotel would charge us int he end  thank goodness   I wouldnt even send my worst enemy there 
N => overcharged three times I initially stayed at this hotel on account of the price and was prepared to forgive the less than modern or and services  However I was eventually charged three times for my rooms and am still having a hard time trying to recover the extra money charged to my credit card  CA is a lot to charge for this kind of room already CA is outrageous  
N => Bad Bad Bad The Hotel looks very nice from the web site but thats about it  The room was very dirty the bathroom had a urine smell the bed and the TV looked like they were from the Salvation Army  I called a friend from their phone and she could bearly hera my voice I had to shout really loud  It costed me  Including Taxes   The only good thing about this hotel was the door man  He was friendly and very helpful  He did not give me any problems when I ask him to return my money for the next two days I had booked it for  You can find much much much better hotels for the same price  Just keep looking and read other reviews  Good Luck 
N => nighte The room was dirty bedsclothing incredible bathroom small dirty pipes leaking    The only advantage near Mont Royal We were happy to leave this hotel in the early morning still alive 
N => Its a keeper Ok   so this place is not the Ritz  In fact it is very basic  There was a bed tv dressers a chair coffee table and bathroom  But it was exceptionally clean Really I didnt go to Montreal to stay in the hotel  It was only used to sleep and shower  So my main concern with a room is to make sure it was clean  It was very clean  Towels were changed daily  The hotel is also not in the tourist part of Montreal but it was a nice part of Montreal  It was very close to many DELICIOUS restaurants  Across the street from the hotel is Dustys which is a great diner for breakfast  We walked to Old Montreal so if youre a good walker youll be fine  We were only like  blocks from Mont Royal park  It was a great spot and very cheap 
N => Great location My boyfriend and I went to Montreal for the weekend and we knew we were going to be spending most of our time in the mile end district so we booked this hotel  We were very pleasantly surprised as it was down the street from everything we wanted to do  Also the staff is extremely helpful especially the man from Lebanon who works there I didnt catch his name but he was wonderful It is a prime location for walking all around  We booked through the hotels site because that was the cheapest deal  I didnt know that you could reserve a parking spot so I highly suggest that you do that  Its  canadiannight but its definitely worth it  The room was very big  Bathroom is very small  The walls are very thin so if youre a light sleeper this might not be the best place for you  The breakfast is not worth going to go get bagels instead or something  All in all this is a no frills place a great bargain and a good find I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Montreal  
N => Awful Experience On Friday e th my husband and I travelled to Montreal for a wedding to take place on the th  When we arrived to our original hotel we discovered there was an involuntary error on their part regarding our booking  Due to this mistake they kindly assisted us in every way possible to find suitable accommodation as soon as possible  The receptionist on shift searched for a hotel in the immediate vicinity and found that Plateau Royale Hotel had vacancies with a pricing of night for two  She also showed us the pictures with the pricing of this type of room we needed  She contacted the person in charge and was given confirmation that they did have a room available for that price  When she transferred me to the lady in charge the lady sounded extremely polite and obtained my information right away trying to know the correct spelling of my card and number immediately  Once we arrived to the hotel the lady in charge a beautiful woman with dark hair and blue eyes was waiting for us with the bill ready to be signed  When I saw the price   I inquired why if the price quoted on their website was different  She explained that it cant be because its Grand Prix weekend and there must have been a mistake on the website  She also said that Room  was the only room she had because an Italian client had called to cancel his booking at last minute because there were problems with his flight  She sounded very convincing saying that I will have difficult to find places everywhere else because hotels were full etc  I ided to sign because I felt I had no alternatives When she gave us our key we went to find our room and we were shocked It was a dusty room in the basement  It smelled of mould and the window was facing what could be called half of a wall  There was no light and the place was awful  We got really angry and of course we ided to leave  We also had the receptionist of our original hotel called the lady to tell her that they had to rectify this immediately  She also told the lady that they had agreed as to what our price would be and sent her the link with the information When we went to reception the lady said that she did understand our frustration  She said she wanted to make us happy and understood that our original hotel always gave them referrals and she wanted to keep things that way  She seemed to have  found  a room on her computer opened a drawer full of key passes not that they had no rooms and sent us to room  saying that she would be looking for the link because she was too busy that moment  We were able to see lots of nervousness in her because she did all the talking and almost gave us no chance to talk  She constantly repeated  You came here I did not bring you here   We went into the room and it was not a room worth   at all  The sheets were clean but the covers had stains inside and were a bit smelly  The bathtub also had debris with the traces of an old mat  I do have pictures of what I saw  When we went downstairs to ask for the original price we saw initially or a refund she said that she could not do that because she was only an employee who earned hr and she could just not reverse the transaction and then pay from her pocket  I said  How come you credited a client s Credit Card and debited her debit card   She said she did it only because the client was paying anyway  She repeated again that we went to the hotel and she did not bring us there  Then she said  You think that the rooms in the other hotel are better I will not say anything but   I d rather not say anything about the rooms in the other hotel  The worst part is that she said that the link that we saw did not open  When we called the receptionist of our original hotel she said that she believed this woman changed it because she could not open it any more herself  It just cannot be that three people saw visions when we saw the web site with the pricing on it  In the end when I asked to see the ladys supervisor to get a refund she said  I m the supervisor   She insisted that it was in their regulations because it s Grand Prix period and repeated  You came here    We did not bring you here   However I was not shown any papers to this effect and I in fact think she is the owner of this hotel  It also did not seem to be full at all because it was fairly quiet  My question is how come our money was so welcome and not us by the sound of her message saying that we went there and she did not bring us there When we called the police they said they would send someone  After almost an hour standing outside we could not wait any longer and ided to go back in and stayed until the next day because we were obviously not getting any refunds whatsoever  
N => ok but bargain It was ok friendly and helpful staff The room was huge for  But the sheets were a bit thread bare and the furniture was old  No iron in the room which I needed Thin ish walls   Clean enough but outdated  
N => Ruby Foo is A OK Went to Ruby Foos on a group bus tour so it was an overnighter  Found the room to be clean and well maintained  The beds were comfortable  It is not too far out of the main swing of things in downtown Montreal and the staff were really helpful in providing us with directions and feedback on spots we should go to  Overall it was a short but pleasant stay  Loved the Asian inspired or as which gave it a different spin  Cant commnent on the food as I did not eat at the hotel but they do appear to have a full service restaurant attached  It was good value for the money we paid for the trip  
N => Stay away from the  standard rooms  I stayed at this hotel to attend a meeting  I cant talk much about the location as we drove in pretty late from Toronto and I was in the back seat so have no clue what the proximity is to downtown There were a few restaurants in the area including you usual fast food choice of McDonalds and Burger King and I noticed a metro station just a  block away  The outside of the hotel itself looked like you typical hotelmotel off the highway  A short  or  level building  We had booked a standard quotnon smoking roomquot  When were on the rd floor via a tiny elevator at took forever to get to   located on one end of the bulding furthest away from the lobby  The elevator was tiny and could fit   people with luggage at best  Turns out the one within a few feet of the lobby was a much nicer elevator   larger and newer which of course led to the more expensive rooms  When we entered the room we were hit with the stench of smoke  I checked another  rooms that my co workers were in to see if it were any better    not only was it not better there was an ashtray and matches on the coffee table in one of the rooms  I went to the front desk and asked for another room  First off I was told that I was indeed in a smoking room  But when I confronted the clerk and said that my next door neighbours room had an ashtray and matches the agent seemed almost embarrassed and didnt have anything further to say except perhaps housekeeping made a mistake putting it in the room  I was told that the hotel was quotsold outquot for the night at that there were no rooms available  I went back to the room and fumed about it sorry for the pun but after a few minutes of trying to air it out by turning on the air conditioning to full blast made another attempt at the front desk  The second person I spoke with at the front desk was more apologetic but still said there wasnt anywhere he could move me to for the night  I said that from where I come from Vancouver all the good hotels would put up guests in another hotel if they were not able to provide what they promised  Secondly I also asked how many rooms they had and asked to confirm that all categories of rooms are sold out  Coming from the industry I am always hesitant to believe that hotels sell out  To which he admitted that the standard room categories were sold out but they had superior rooms and that Id have to pay more for these rooms  He mentioned that this happens all the time which cant be a good sign  He asked my if I were allergic to smoke etc  At this time I was pretty annoyed    I personally am not allergic to smoke but since I dont smoke and have a legal right to get a non smoking room dont see why my so called non smoking room smells of smoke and that they felt that I had to pay more to get a non smoking one  Its almost like getting penalized for not being a smoker To make a really really long story short    I did get another room though they made me felt like they were doing me a favour by upgrading me to a deluxe room  Though the new room was nicer I would have been fine sleeping in the standard room had it not smelled of smoke If I happen to stay here again knowing what I know I would personally opt to pay for the difference in the room just to get a nicer room  BUT I still find that their pictures on the website of the standard rooms are a bit misleading must have been taken many years ago and that the service is questionable given the time and extremes I had to go to get a room that doesnt smell of smoke  
N => Our group stayed at Ruby Foos Group rate was done by Hotel Wars ca We booked our group with Hotel Wars which was not listed as an option on this site  The company got us  bids and we choose ruby foos  The hotel was really close to our MTL office and it is four stars  The service was fine and the food was worth the price  The thing is because we didnt book with Expedia hotels ca or orbitz we did not have to pay commission  Hotels are forced to keep the rate high when their is a third party  Hotel Wars ca does not take commissions  The price was really good  And the hotel was a perfect   I will go back and refer Ruby Foos to any and all  
N => Amazing Staff We overnighted at this hotel enroute to a wedding  We found the staff to be amazing  They were extremely helpful spending a considerable amount of time locating directions to a wedding ceremony and reception  The room was clean and it worked for our purposes  
N => Oh Hell No Okay  Would I return here  No thanks  This hotel looks all that but once you get in no free breakfast they charge extra for everything  In the end my dad nearly flipped out on the front desk guy  The bill was closer to  smackers and that was one night stay in Montreal  We are going to try another hotel should we be back in town for another netball game  I mean no loyalty points and anyways  I could go on for hours  They do have nice childrens furniture  Too bad they are supposed to be regular sizes  Not kidding  They have kids stuff doubling as regular sized stuff  
N => not a quality hotel I was forced to stay at this Hotel because of a cancelled flight due to weather conditions when i arrived they made me wait  minutes to check in  The hallways are very dark and old looking I finally got to my room it was hot and stuffy ac didnt work The toilet backed up while i using it One thing I am certain about is that this Hotel is definitely not worth the price i paid do yourselves a favor and dont stay at this place 
N => What a Rip Off Customer service does NOT make Americans feel welcome They quotsnickerquot as soon as your back is turned  Prices for EVERYTHING there is WAY TOO HIGH  The internet connection never workedeither did the air conditioning  Housekeeping just walked right on into your room even when the quotdo not disturbquot sign was on the door I even called the manager of the hotel explaining all of this  and more with NO reply at all THEY DONT CARE I would NOT recommend anyones stay I will NOT be back there   EVER 
N => bad Hotel stay I was traveling to Montreal for family business I stayed at the Ruby Foos HotelI had a horrible experience  The check in was delayed due to a untrained clerk  Once I funally checked in I was forced to walk for  minutes until I finally found my room  The room was hot and smelly  The furniture was not well taken care of I would not stay here again A little further down arie Blvd there is a nice Quality Hotel  I plan on trying that Hotel next time I come to Montreal 
N => Convenient   but no big deal We  adults  teenager stayed here for  nights in y   We had read the tripadvisor reviews and ided on balance to book   particularly as it was near the Airport for our departure  We left with mixed views  The positive ones were its location for the airport its closeness to Namur Metro Station a real bonus if you want to be out of the city itself its air conditioning throughout the hotel and in the room a ent bar with the friendliest barman we met on holiday its speed of service when we required more towels and its overall cleanliness  We didnt use the pool but it was kept very clean and was clearly a good area to bathe and relax  On the downside we were charged half a days rate to retain the room for an extra  hours upto pm without the room being cleaned or reserviced  We really wanted the room until  pm prior to our flight but the duty manager wouldnt negotiate beyond pm  Weve regularly done this on our holidays to Canada and  although we understand it should carry some charge we had never been charged before  Half a day was excessive in any case Also the hotel is a bit weird in its or   we couldnt quite make out what it was trying to be  There appeared to be so many different influences at work in its or that it was pretty confused really  We couldnt say it was a poor hotel because on the whole we enjoyed the stay but we left feeling a bit ripped off and a feeling that as long as all is well this is a ent place to stay   but if things werent to your satisfaction we just werent sure what the reaction from the duty manager would be  This lack of confidence means we probably wouldnt stay here again and now we have visited the city we know there is no need to stay outside the city centre   everything is easily accessible including the airport  We were very impressed with Montreal and wished we had given ourselves a bit more time there there really is plenty for tourists to do and the waterfont and surrounding area is superb for eating drinking history and people watching Exceeded our expectations   a pity Ruby Foos didnt  
N => Not value for money The rate was well over priced  Paid gt for two nights on line but was shocked when arrived to see the condition of the hotel outside and the room inside  
N => Stuck in Montreal with no room reservation Just had the opportunity to visit Montreal with a friend recently unfortunately we did not make any reservation prior and did not know that the Formula One race circuit was in town then  As it turned out the only hotel with air conditioning somehow it was over  degrees was Ruby Foos  The website made this proeperty out to be a little better than it really was  The positives for Ruby Foos  near the metro just off Hwy  close to airport clean bed  The negatives for Ruby Foos  pool closed parking lot and entrance is a very dusty construction zone rooms are dark and very noisy in a questionable neighborhood close to Hwy s terrible traffic no cocktail lounge rooms are kind of tired Howard Johnson style I can only blame myself for the situation of having to stay there and if I returned would receive a discount due to the reation  However it is most unlikely that I will ever visit Ruby Foos again  Loved Montreal and will certainly return there I have stayed in much worse than Ruby Foos once all their promised reations are complete this might be a touch better  My next stay will be at the Vogue or W  
N => Motel in Disguise Was forced by the company I was working for to stay at Ruby Foos many times  It is nothing more than a converted motel stuck out in a working class neighbourhood  Food is expensive and mediocre They were trying to pass themselves off as a boutique hotel but I complained and luckily that status was recinded by Boutique Hotels International Tacky is the word that first comes to mind  
N => Okay but not great The only reason to ever stay at this place is if you need to for some reason be near Hampstead the crossroads area where the highways converge or within  minutes of Dorval  Despite a flashy website this isnt a real nice hotel  The whole place has this bizarre pseudo Japanese feel to it but its done poorly  The lobby was nice enough and rooms were okay but the fixtures werent very nice and in general the elevator halls and rooms were a somewhat musty and dingy  Again it wasnt uncomfortable it just wasnt real nice  I  have to stay here again but Ill probably check out the Quality Inn just a mile away on arie before I do  
N => Average hotel Good price not a excellent location but it was fine Rooms are really big and clean  
N => cheap and cheerful we booked  nights  nights then up north for a few days and then  night on our return  first visit the room was grand  in general i think for the price it was fine some of the staff were great and some not so great but no one was unfriendly  first visit we got a non smoking room as requested but sadly they had forgotten and we had a smoking room which stank esp as we found the ice bucket had not been emptied and it was full of cig ends      not good i know stuff happens     but there is no excuse for that  place was full so we couldnt change to non smoking  i wouldnt stay here again but only because of the location for us it was not the best i would go towards rue roy direction but otherwise the hotel is fine as long as you are not going there to stay in your room  
N => Tiny room We chose this hotel to be in Montreal on our last night in Quebec  Our first night at the airport Travelodge was much more comfortable  We got a rate of  and when we added parking and taxes we paid around   For that we got the tiniest room we have ever gotten that includes rooms in Paris  The bathroom was tiny but ok  However the room itself was so small the coffee machine had to be put on a shelf high up  I had to climb on the bed to get it  Once we put our two small suitcases down we had to climb over them to get to the other side of the bed  The carpet was worn out and the room was a bit sad and outdated which would have been ok for a night  However the room was so small that it was uncomfortable  The hotel might be ok for the more expensive rooms but if your budget is under  you surely can do better 
N => Small but clean I was very pleased with my stay at Hotel St Denis  The hotel is in a very good location walkable to many sights clean free wireless connection and overall inexpensive  My only complaints the room was very small and the bathroom was tiny the sink was outside the bathroom and parking was a little expensive night but that seemed to be the going rate  
N => Surprising small charming hotel We book our hotel through Orbitz at the last minute not really knowing where it was  We arrived late and a nice gentlemen was there to welcome us  Everything was clean and the beds were perfect  All the staff was really helpful they take the time to answer all our question and find us every night a nice restaurant to eat at Without hesitation we will book this hotel again 
N => The worst reservation experience Before starting I must say that my rating is not for the hotel but for their attitude  I never stayed at this hotel I tried to make a reservation for the Grand Prix weekend  All the hotels were fully booked and I could just find this only room in this hotel for some  CAD  We were going  people and I gave the lady on the phone all the details including my credit card information  At the end of the phone call she asked me to confirm the details and she started to tell me everything back  She must have misheard me and right after she said quotfor one personquot I corrected her and said it is for  not   She said that room is not good for  people but  max  So she didnt let me reserve the room for  and I said ok I am not booking it then  A week later I saw that amount had been charged on my credit card  I called them immediately  They couldnt find my name in the computer  They asked me to call a couple of days later to talk to Catherine I dont know how to spell her name the manager  I called them on that day and no one picked up my phone  After like  calls at different times on the same day finally I could talk to someone who connected me to Catherine  I told her the story  And she said quotyour story is hard to believe quot She couldnt find my name in the computer either  Then she put me on hold to go through some stuff  Later I guess she found that amount had been charged for no show for the room quotI bookedquot  I repeated once again that I had never booked the room  She said quotthe one you talked to must have told you everything correctly and you must have misunderstood  I dont believe your story and I wont refund this amount back quot This conversation lasted for a couple more minutes as I was going insane  Then she finally said ok I will refund it but I still dont believe you I go to Montreal very often but I dont think I will ever stay at that hotel in the future  The hotel  be nice but this experience was enough for me  
N => You can do a lot better in Montreal without spending a lot more  Oftentimes reading reviews on TripAdvisor I wonder if other reviewers are grading based on an absolute level of quality or on the relative value provided  Having stayed at the St Denis I can only conclude that it has earned such a high score on the basis of its low cost  Even then that must be based on the high season because on my visit this ember some great hotels Id been to the Omni the Kutuma were only a little bit more expensive  To put it simply the loss of quality was not worth the savings in money I will give the hotel credit where due It was clean  It was worn down a bit old stains on the carpet and furniture but clearly not un cared for or unsanitary  Housekeeping was quite thorough  The location was excellent for those wanting to be close to all the metros and a mere block away from the gay village My praise must end there  The walls were exceedingly thin    or at least the floors and ceiling were as my friend and I were frequently disturbed by noise from our downstairs neighbors or from the hallway  The bed linens though clean were as worn down as the rest of the room and certainly not of a quot Starquot quality who gives those stars out anyways  Most irritating of all the quotfree wi fiquot that I paid for when I booked the reservation was out of commission the entire time I was there  According to the front desk clerk I talked to this was not an uncommon occurrance and they certainly exhibited no great desire to repair it quickly and in fact seemed rather irritated that I asked about it more than once So beware TripAdvisor travelers    the St  Denis will provide you with a clean space to lay your head but not much else  Unless it is far and away a better deal than more reputable hotels when you visit do yourself a favor and spend a little extra to find comfort and service 
N => Not a  star hotel We stayed one night last weekend which was enough  The price was right but the room was extremely smoky and the bathroom smelled very musty  There were cigarette burns on the carpet and on the bathtub If you stay and you dont like smoke be sure to ask for a non smoking room if they even offer them  
N => Amazing excellent place to stay   service was great restaurants and great places to eat right beside  Metro not even a  min walk  this was my first trip with my boyfriend and we celeberating our anniversary  The staff was very helpful and was present  hrs a day  rooms were clean and nicely spaced  Free wireless internet was a great feature  Would go to no other hotel if i go back  
N => Check your Bathroom Inspect your room We had room  and were surprised to find that the bathroom door doesnt close  There is a handle but no bolt to click in place and no locking device either We also didnt have a shower curtain  The staff at  p m  couldnt help us but when we mentionned this to the night auditor at  p m  he found us a curtain and had it installed within minutes of our request  The Pacini restaurant next door is great as well as the free breakfast  This was a clean room great price great breakfast but with a few things that need looking into  
N => Good value for money Chose this property based on the good reviews found on Tripadvisor  Happy to say they did not disappoint  Very clean property comfortable bed in an adequate sized room and free dependable wireless internet a plusDrawbacks NOISEY air conditioner   so bad the only time we had it on was when we werent in the room and because the AC unit takes up half the window theres only a small section of window to see out of at the top Neighborhood was OK   very central to metro old Montreal ect  but we spent alot of our time walking up St  Denis to the great restaurants further up the hill mont royal metro stn Overall though very good value for money    our complaints were very minimal    if youre on a budget this property is a good fit  
N => Quaint clean and very efficient I went to Montreal in t   the weather was cold and the hotel was cool  It was the first time for me going and my travel mate is a native Montrealan  I hope thats how you say it   I did not want to spend a lot and wanted to drive up from Philadelphia so parking was something to consider  I travel a lot and have stayed at very nice hotels and very crappy hotels in different parts of the world  I would say for the price this was a wonderful deal  My room was small to average  like a room I had in Paris  with no air conditioning  did not need it in t  but what about y   My bed was a full size bed pretty comfy and bathroom was clean  shower without great water pressure   Parking I think was  dollars double check price  you get a parking card to park around the corner dirty little street but safe parking then you pay at check out  I must say the hotel served its purpose for me  I wanted a spot that after hanging in the city I could come to and relax in and I found that  It is certainly not a luxury or boutique style hotel but the price and location make it worth trying out  Oh yes I cant say a thing about the staff because I was in and out all the time and paid them no mind other than to say quotbonjourquot Elisha 
N => not bad The hotel was fine  not great  The room was rather small but we could manage  As for the location  the neighbourhood didnt seem dangerous but there were lots of sex shops sex clubs etc around The front desk was ok but they didnt seem to go out of their way to help you  It was one of the only places we visited which didnt give us maps  On Saturday morning breakfast is not served before  and no one bothered to tell you ahead  As we were in a hurry to the airport we just walked a few blocks to have breakfast I dont think Id stay in this hotel once more  
N => A Great Find I was very pleased with every aspect of this hotel The price was great and the room was nice and clean The hotel is right in town so it was easy to get to everything we wanted to see I also thought all of the staff were very friendly and I would stay there again if going to Montreal  
N => Friendly clean hotel with wonderful stafrf Staff were particularly helpful rooms were simple but very clean  Theres a delighful restaurant next door  The continental breakfast included was minimal but full menu was available  
N => nice room in the heart of the city We were pleasantly surprised when we came to Hotel St  Denis  The room we had was clean and quiet the price was excellent and we were right downtown close to everything we wanted to see  The little cafe attached to the hotel was really nice and the breakfast they served us which is included was excellent  Not just your plain old continental breakfast  The hallways look like they need some work but the room was stylish and very comfortable  The one draw back is that parking is behind the hotel in an underground garage that isnt attached to the hotel  We had to run with our suitcase in the rain from the garage to the hotel lobby but it wasnt that far  We really liked it here and would definitely stay again  
N => For the money it was a good buy We stayed in this hotel because of the cheap price  The room was clean and we didnt seem to have the same issues that previous guests had  Each stay comes with free breakfast in the French Resturant  We like the resturant so much that we also had a dinner there  It was the best meal we had all week The only thing we didnt like about the stay was the location  It was in the more bohemian section of town and we actually got verbally assulted by a strung out kid hanging out in front of the hotel  We would recommend this for anyone looking for a low price place to stay however when we go back we will choose another part of town to stay in  
N => this hotel needs new shower heads shower pressure too low  when they changed the shower head the pressure was too strong I am NOT a picky person but Id like to take a shower in ust 
N => Good clean friendly staff   
N => Worst hotel I have ever seen  
N => Poor excuse for Boutique Hotel When you check in to a boutique hotel you look for the finer things in life to make your stay more enjoyable but most of all you expect impeccable service because after all you pay a little more for a whole lot   right No but top notch service will definately make up for where detail is dropped  It was just OK  No king size beds so dimly lit you know they are hiding the poor paint job  Furniture was old worn and torn common breakfast area on the nd floor  It was really smoke and mirrors  Not once did a doorman open the door for you and no one smiled and said quothelloquot  I felt like I was bothering the employees  
N => Hotel St Paul   Overrated   Very Hard Bed This hotel was a major disappointment  The bed was like a rock  No box spring base   just a slab of wood  My back was killing me  If you like a hard bed this place is for you  The place tries to be too cool  It is dark and to my mind that just hides the dirt  The gym was absolutely lhable  It had about  machines that were about  years old and the treadmill kept stopping mid use which was bit dangerous  The breakfast was terrible with limited food on the buffet which was not replenished in a timely manner  We had to consistently ask for things and the breakfast room was terribly austere  The best thing about this hotel was the location  The staff were on the whole ok apart from one rude concierge but I would never stay here again  
N => My Stay was  Fine  but Not Exceptional   Not Really Worth the Price My husband took a trip to Montreal for the Labor Day weekend  A while back I had read a favorable review in the NY Times on Hotel St  Paul so I thought it would be a great place to try  I looked on TripAdviser and all of the reviews looked pretty good so I went ahead and booked us a room  Overall our experience was fine  I have no real complaints the location is perfect the rooms were clean albeit pretty small and it was nice to have breakfast included in the morning  However I dont think it was worth the money we paid  The hotel staff were very kind and polite but the concierge service was so so  Basically the hotel only had two restaurants to recommend that were right down the street from the hotel  When we asked for other choices they didnt really have any  Im figuring they have some sort of deal w those two restaurants and were told to recommend all guests to go there  The hotel or was very simple   but almost to the point where you thought it was cheap   not chic minimalistic  In sumy I would say our stay was good but next time I go to Montreal I will probably try somewhere else  
N => Sheek and beatiful Exquisitely designed hotel not just for looks but comfort  
N => Most beautiful place to stay in Montreal My friends and I spent a weekend in Montreal and had the good fortune to stay at the Hotel St Paul  The hotel itself is incredibly beautiful and well styled  Our rooms were gorgeous with an amazing view and the bathrooms are to die for  Everything was clean and well kept  More importantly the staff were incredibly helpful they gave us advice on where to eat what to see and where to go for nightlife  They answered all of our many questions and we ended up having a great time no doubt due to their kind advice  We had dinner and drinks at the restaurant and we still talk about how delicious it was  I would absolutely recommend the Hotel St Paul to anyone visiting Montreal I know that we cannot wait to go back  F licitation 
N => dont stay here whatever you do I stayed at the st paul with  other colleagues in    worst hotel experience ever  There was no hot water for two of the five days that I stayed  Not consecutive days so theynever bothered to fix the problem the first time  The staff atttude was absolutely disgusting  When there was no hot water at  am the response was that the engineer didnt start till  am so they didnt know anything till then  when it was suggested that they  want to contact him and get him in early the response was simple  no The breakfast was terrible  two types of fruit and cheese and that was it apart from cereal and bread  The yoghurt was out the boiled eggs were out the bananas were out  The staff dont ever apologise for anything being wrong with the hotel the attitude is quotit isnt my faultquot  I would sack every one if they worked for me The last day says it all  I asked to speak with the manager   of course he didnt start till  so I asked that he call my room  At  am I have to check out and ring to tell them that I still have had no contact with the manager  The response is quotYou told me room  we have been calling thatquot  Not a quotIm sorry I must have written the room down wrong just a simple not my problem  I could list a million other issues  no phone charges out of towels can you believe this rooms poorly cleaned or not cleaned at all and thenyou are calling reception to tell them and they tell you the cleaning staff have gone home Do yourself a favour  just dont stay here 
N => shouldve taken bad review seriously Prior to this trip I read reviews about this hotel on this site  One review made me concern was the one by quotBreezyquot  But I also read managements reply on that review and I thought itll be ok  Well now I learned I shouldve taken that review seriously  quotPerfumes Chemicalquot mentioned in the review When we were checking in I noticed the distinctive sweet quotsmellquot and made me think about the review  But Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful I tried not to think about it  But at the end of our stay this smell became un tolerable  We couldnt wait till leave the hotel  Uncomfortable bedWe couldnt pinpoint what was so wrong about the bed but we had terrible night sleep  Yes the bed was hard but I like hard bed usually  I think it was the bedding gave us some sort of allergic reaction  The hotel gave us a choice to be environmentally friendly not to change the sheets everyday so the second day we slept in the same sheets and had bad sleep again  We asked to change the sheets on the rd day and some how we had better sleep  Till then we were both sneezing and I had hives  But I was in the denial we thought we were just catching a cold since it was so cold out   So my vacation turned out quite uncomfortable one  I shouldve taken the advise by quotBreezyquot  
N => Worst hotel experience EVER My experience at the Hotel St Paul was without a doubt the worst Ive ever had  Never mind that the halls are dark the rooms are small and the beds are hard as rock what made it impossible for me and my fiance to stay at this hotel was the fact that both the lobby and the rooms themselves reek of some kind of perfumed chemicalUpon checking in during the early afternoon we both noticed an overpowering perfume odor emanating through the lobby  As I have traveled EXTENSIVELY for work and never before encountered a lobby that smelled like cheap car freshener I assumed the offense was coming from a female guest who was checking in ahead of us  But lo and behold when we entered our room we discovered that it was even worse Im not sure I can do justice to how overwhelming and sickeningly sweet the smell was but my eyes immediately started watering my throat constricted and my head started pounding  We called the front desk ASAP to explain that there was an overwhelming perfumey smell throughout our room  They sent up a porter who matter of factly explained that EACH TIME the rooms are cleaned they are sprayed with something to make them quotsmell good quot He went on to say that he would try to find us an empty room that had not yet been made up for the day  About  minutes later he returned to move us to a room down the hall  It appeared to be a downgrade as the lamp shade hung off the lamp broken and there was a large stain on the floor  The smell seemed like it might not be as strong but I wasnt sure since I was actually having DIFFICULTY BREATHING by this pointMy fiance immediately opened the windows as far as they would go with the hopes of airing out the room and then he took me outside to get me some fresh air  After approximately  minutes of walking around I was feeling better so we returned to the hotel hopeful that the open windows would have done the trick  Well upon re entering our room I was again assaulted by the overwhelming fumes of whatever it is they spray throughout their space  My headache came pounding back and I found myself nauseous from the smell  It wasnt that the scent itself stunk it was that the chemicals were so strong that they were literally making me sick to my stomach  My fiance took one look at me pale with watering eyes and said quotThere is no way you can stay here  Im having trouble breathing myself quotSo we went down to the front desk and explained our situation  We were told that the hotel would have been able to refund our money in full on the spot but because we had quotmade the mistakequot of booking through Travelocity we would now have to contact them and have a cancellation form faxed over  Once they received the form from Travelocity they assured us that they would be able to refund our money in full for the first night  They were however immediately able to refund our money for the following two nights  I will add that though the clerk at the front desk was forthcoming with this information he was in no way friendly or apologetic about our situation  In fact he was fairly rude So there my fiance and I were in Old Montreal with all our luggage and nowhere to go and with hoops to jump through in order to get a full refund  What a way to start a vacation  But the story doesnt end there  Once we were finally situated at another hotel no easy feat to find an opening at the last moment we contacted Travelocity so that they could fax the cancellation form to the Hotel St Paul  Travelocity said that they first needed to contact the hotel  When they did the Hotel St Paul told them that if we had not wanted to stay in the hotel we never shouldve checked in in the first place WHAT What happened to quotjust have them fax over a cancellation form so that we can refund your moneyquot The Hotel St Paul then went on to say that we had been at the hotel for more than  hours and for those two reasons combined they were now refusing to refund our money  But it was a boldface lie as we had not even been IN MONTREAL for  hours at that point The bottom line is that the Hotel St Paul STOLE over  from us for a room we were not in for even  hours they lied when they promised us a refund they were rude to us and Im fairly sure they filled our room anyway since it was very hard for us to find a vacancy elsewhere and there were others on the street looking as well  My question is how dare the Hotel St Paul ADMIT to spraying chemicals throughout their rooms after I told them that I was having a reaction but then refuse to refund our money We did not stay at their hotel for the simple reason that we COULD NOT physically stay at their hotel  Had we tried to continue to stay there I very likely wouldve had to go to a dor  As it was it took hours of me resting in bed with a rag over my head to recover  I was sick from the fumes in that place Sick And WHY did the clerk at the front desk tell us that our money would be refunded if they never intended to refund our moneyHonestly I would advise anyone   especially people who find themselves the least bit sensitive to chemicals   to look elsewhere  This hotel is waaaay overrated and the experience was the very worst hotel experience Ive ever had and I have stayed at a lot of hotels As I said the halls are dark the rooms are nothing special the beds are uncomfortable   but it is the God awful fumes permeating the air that will make you wish youd never set foot in this place  I know there are a lot of positive reviews about this hotel but I am begging you to heed the negative reviews  Several people have complained of being treated poorly by the staff and I saw another review where the patrons were told that had they made their reservation through the front desk via phone as opposed to through the Hotels website they couldve gotten a full refund  Excuses excuses  What difference does it make if you book your reservation over the phone through their website or through a travel website If you have people who are so unhappy with what theyre encountering be the staff of Hotel St Paul should pay attention At the very least an apology with a refund is in order  Think twice people  There are much better hotels out there  Much better  
N => Wow   Im impressed We booked this hotel through the Montreal tourism website and got a wonderful deal  Check in was quick and friendly  I told her this was my first time to Montreal and she quickly pulled out a map and showedme where we were and a few points of interest  Its the little things that get me   when we went into our room everything looked impecable and there was nice music playing  You have to use your room key to have any lights on  I thought this was an interesting energy saving idea  I took some pictures almost right away before I had time to mess the place up too badly I thought the bed and the chair were both quite comfortable and fell in love with the bath tub  I had  nice long bathes while I was therestayed  nights  I just wanted to comment that everything in the room and bathroom were spotless Unfortunately we were awoken a little earlier than we would have liked  There is some construction near by  The first morning it didnt wake us until am but the second morning they were at it at like am  Its nothing that you can hold against the hotel though Breakfast was nice  A wide variety of breads cereal cheese fruit and yogurt  It was a nice relaxing start to the day  We didnt use our car once while we were there  We walked to the bell centre and down through old Montreal  We took a cab to St  Catherines street forshopping but thats only because it was raining  We took the Metro out to the bio dome the metro station is a short walk from the hotel Overall I was very impress with this hotel  If I return to MontrealI will definately consider staying here again  
N => Overall good service needs upgrading The good nice room studio suite  well designed clean light comfortable plenty of storage great location excellent restaurant The mediocre bathroom some nice design touches but overall more  star than  star housekeeping infrequent and not helpful the service at the restaurant then again pretty normal for Montreal  nice enough but desperately inefficient the breakfast buffet dont like them anyway so be Im biased The bad the reception staff with one exception sorry dont remember his name otherwise ranging from rude to ineffective to well painfully slow and unfortunately all requests from restaurant reservations to housekeeping etc go through reception  The worst reservation had been mysteriously canceled and only major aggressiveness and string pulling secured a room  
N => Has potential but needs some direction Recently returned from a  night stay at Hotel St  Paul  Had booked it because of the good reviews as well as the nod from Travel amp Leisure in their top  hotels issue Overall not bad but not sure about the top  stuff missing too many details to get a rating this lofty Staff are very good attentive and willing to do the extra  Cleanliness is missing a beat front lobby has mixed paint patterns on walls around reception floors are generally quite dirty especially in corners were details are usually missed  Furniture in lobby is beaten up legs on chairs could use some work Rooms are quite nice ently appointed TV in our room was a pain as remote control never worked properly either couldnt get it to switch channels or it did  channels at a time  Turn down service which is used as good publicity in all their advertising was hit and miss we received it on  nights only it appears unless you are going out at pm only you will get it otherwise the lady doing it the one night was asked at  to come back in an hour once we had left but never returned  Room service trays stay in the halls for hours not very nice for look or smell Breakfast is excellent on the nd floor great selection and ent service  Location is ideal for those looking to be in Old Montreal found it to be quite quiet in evenings and only a   minute walk to most restaurants Place has potential but needs a little direction from the top to be who they claim to be   would recommend but with reservations 
N => Youll probably get more for your  elsewhere The hotel is in the outskirts of the Old Town but in easy walking distance to the Metro as well as restaurants and bars which is convenient  The outside and the surrounding environs of St  Paul is lovely  However what I noticed when I first got out of the cab was the enormous sewage excavation that was taking place around the entrance of the hotel  This was apparently to continue for the next couple of months  Thankfully my room was high enough that I never heard any construction noises but I imagine the floors closer to street level werent so fortunate Check in was smooth and shortly after I got to my room front desk called up to see if everything was all right  I asked for an extra robe as the double occupancy room I had only seemed to have one  The clerk cheerfully told me she would send it up with someone from housekeeping  Neither housekeeping nor robe arrived  We ended up asking the cleaning staff for an extra robe the next morning  The room itself was small and oddly orated with modern touches mixed with particle board Ikea esque furniture  The hotel was very very dimly lit which I can only guess was meant to add a quotmodernquot look to the place  Breakfast consisted of cold pastries and cereal  The toiletries smelled vile and the soap felt like a rubber eraser and foamed up not at all  All of these issues are minor but when added up they didnt warrant the amount we were spending on our stay  But most of all the service just wasnt what we expected  Upon check out we noticed the the bill included a charge for the minibar  Since neither of us had even taken anything from the fridge we contested it  Instead of apologising for the error and taking the  charge off the clerk asked question after question  Were we sure that we didnt take the alcohol from the minibar Was anyone else staying with us that could have possibly taken it Had we had guests up to our room Then she took out a large book that I guess contained records of everything that was ever restocked in every minibar in the hotel and proceeded to search for evidence  Basically calling us liars  Yes folks after spending five nights and over  at a hotel we frequently like to get a little something back by taking a  bottle of bourbon and lying to the hotel  We remained as civil as possible and after  more minutes of more quotare you surequot questions from the clerk she finally deigned to take the charge off  It left us with a sour note to an otherwise great visit to Montreal  Ill definitely be back to the city but not to Hotel St  Paul  
N => Loved it As other reviewers wrote the location was perfect  The staff was unfailingly nice and helpful  The rooms are small but we were not in Montreal to spend the day in the hotel  the high ceilings do make up for it  The beds are comfortable  it is no Ritz but you are not spending   Really we had no complaints and will stay there next time  
N => STYLISH MODERNISM We spent a few nights at this lovely hotel to enjoy Vieux Montreal  The rooms were comfortablebaths were spacious bed was fluffy  Modernist touches everywhere gave the hotel a jetsons feel if you enjoy such  Very Chic 
N => Great Hotel We have only just begun to emerge from the bliss that ked our stay in Montreal at the St  Paul Hotel  This was our second visit to this hotel and we are once again grateful for the warmth and hospitality which ked our five nights there When we were making arrangements to return to Montreal last month we were tempted to stay at one of the many other boutique hotels which have opened in downtown Montreal  There are so many now and so many which seem to offer so many amenities which are pleasing to us  But in the end what convinced us to return to the St  Paul were the memories we had from our first visit there And now this time again we have a multitude of good memories to remind us of all that is good about Montreal  Everyone on staff at the St  Paul was extremely helpful to us insuring that we had a cab when we needed one and extra hangars and extension cords and such and housekeeping was most accommodating about our erratic sleep patterns  All of which is to say that we are very happy to have been guests at the St  Paul and we look forward to many more pleasant nights there Thanks for all they do to keep their guests happy and relaxed  
N => Wonderfull service  
N => Hotel St  Paul so not worth the hype  
N => convenient to hospitals My mother and I stayed here when visiting a relative in the Jewish General Hospital Hopital Generale Juif  From what we could tell it was the only hotel in the area   an area which according to my map has seven hospitals  Our room was comfortable and spacious with two double beds a kitchenette a giant closet and a arate living room  For anyone needing to stay near the hospital it was very convenient   about a  minute walk or a very short cab ride from the Jewish Hospital and as other reviewers have noted lots of stores and restaurants and  hour amenities nearby The room was clean but our major complaint was the smell  It was a smoking room and they had used copious amounts of room deodorizer to mask the odors  Even with the windows open and the fan blowing for  hours the dank chemical stale smell was still very noticeable the next morning  They do have nonsmoking rooms available  The room was in the back and reasonably quiet  We did not hear any noises from other guests during our brief overnight stayIf I were to come back to Montreal I would probably look for a nicer hotel in a different area but for the purpose of our trip this hotel was just fine the or  have been dated and the place a bit shabby but overall it was a good location good value and the staff were very pleasant  
N => Hotel from hell     the service is the worst I have ever experienced I needed to change my booking by  day I contacted them by phone and email numerous time within a month of my arrival and no one called  emailed me back  When I fianally got a hold of someone they said that I lied that I never did called  emailed to advised them of my change request  What a load of bull     i immediatly requested to speak to the manager was transfered left a vm and never was contacted again    I finally was able to change my reservation but was charged   of the cost anyways WTFI stayed there since I could not get a refund the room served its purpose quotto sleepquot and when I left I was sold a airport bus shuttle ticket at   Got to the bus hopped on and was told my ticket was invalid that I had to by another one I would never recommend hotel viger and will never go back  
N => Dont bother This place leaves something to be desired   and thats being kind  The hallway stank of excrement as did the room  The staff were relatively helpful but you just wouldnt want to stay there despite that  It would be fine for one night after a long evening out drinking and you didnt care about the state of the place  The bathroom was disgusting bin wasnt emptied from previous guests  We had a room on the ground floor by the front door   the doorbell was ringing throughout the night when someone above used water you could hear them the same with someone moving around on the stairs  You could hear every conversation on Reception at any time including heated family arguments in the morning  Just not good  When we checked out they did offer to change our room though  
N => Never again We didnt mind it the first time  But when we went back the hotel had gone downhill  Dint realize til we I got my next credit card statement that the hotel had compromised my card Wish I could prove it  
N => OK For The Price I have seen a review which I have to say was at least unfair and definitely an exaggeration The hotel although not a four star was more than adequate  within walking distance to just about everything to do and see Lets face it when your in Montreal you dont want to stay in a hotel all day The room was small but clean and comfortable The bathroom very cleanand although t v  was mostly in french we plowed our way threw At the prices we could have paidthe Viger was a weekend three star hotel  
N => Terrible At check in the  manager  told as rudely to go and check to see if we liked the room  I was wondering why would he send us to take a look before checking in but a few minutes later I found my answer the hallways were dirty and smelly and the room had the toilet broken  Since all hotels in Montreal were booked due to Diverscit   we only complained about the toilet  The guy was very upset and sent us to a different room in a different area of the hotel  The place was terrible In our way to our room we saw that many rooms didnt even have a lock  There was a sofa in the quotloungequot pilled up with garbage and the room had a very sticky carpet the tv didn t work and the mattress  sheets were too small Since I didn t want to sleep on top of a disgustingly dirty mattress I slept with my clothes on and never ever touched the carpet except with my shoes on  Needless to say we left the following morning So unless you know for sure that they have done a serious remodelling to this place dont even consider this hotel 
N => Its okay if you are a student looking for something cheap If you really want to save some money and are looking for a place to dump your bags then this is it  Otherwise I would go somewhere else  The staff could learn to be more friendly to make your stay comfortable however they prefer to look at you like a stranger  The breakfast situation was really pathetic  We had to pick up our coffee and muffins from the counter and take it up to our rooms  The coffeetea was served in styrofoam cups how ridiculous  If only they could have turned the small computer room situated adjacent to the reception cubicle into a little breakfast area would make it more convenient for guests to pick up their breakfast  
N => I would never go back there again  My girlfriend and I went to Montreal for a  day vacation and we thought it would be nice to stay in a nice small private hotel not too far from Old Montreal  So we found Hotel Viger and theres a sign outside rooms for  AC phone and cable TV so we thought wow thats cheap  Once I got in the desk clerk could barely speak french or english  All I told him is that I wanted a room with  bed for  nights and he showed us this tiny room with a queen size bed in the middle  The one night stand one little lamp a bar fridge a bathroom and a TV so we thought not bad and its quiet  So we ask how much he says in broken english night I ask him about the sign outside he thats a room with no bathroom  I was able to bargain with him by telling him I was going to somewhere else and I finally got the price down to   So I book it  I start bringing the luggage in and I notice the bar fridge isnt plugged in no big deal  But after dinner went we got back we found out that it was hard to find parking the AC barely work the shower was leaking the phone line was cut and there was no TV  I tried to complain to the desk clerk but he was so rude because of his broken english that he hid in his room  The next night I got a call for a family emergency so I went to tell the desk clerk of this information and that Id like a refund for my rd night that I paid he refuse telling me that he didnt know how to do a refund on a credit card and that its  hours notice he needs    TOTAL BS because he never said this info to me NOR is it posted in the lobby on the back of the receipt OR in the room  All he told me is to go to the aiport and theyll give me my money back  I call the aiport the next day on my way home and the lady told me that the airport doesnt do hotel reimbursement and that I was had by him  I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone or any rat that  live in Montreal to stay there  I would rather sleep in a cardboard box on St Catherines St  before I would go there  
N => Good Hotel for a GREAT price I read the reviews of this hotel on this website from others before me and became Very nervous about my ision to book one room for  adults during the holidays to tour the City especially as the other couple dont do budget hotels However it was a small clean hotel  The only thing that stunk was the desk clerk   but I can live with that  Being that we were  couples sharing a room I was very impressed that there was a wall arating the two beds for our privacy  The bathroom was clean   as were the sheets my two priorities for any hotel  The room was really warm when we entered   but Id rather a warm room and turn it down and crack open the window than a cold room I was impressed that they still served us our continental breakfast after it was over   its only from  am  but all  of us got orange juice and a big muffin the Costco sized ones at am For  per person per night we definitely got our money worth and whenever I return to Montreal I will stay there   unless I want an upper scale  romantic room    but this time I wanted a budget room  Even my picky friends were very impressed Only complaint was that we went before New Years and there were a lot of loud partiers in the hallway after the bars closed    but I didnt voice a complaint to either the partiers or managers  Budget hotels attracted those people obviously  
N => Family Tradition Every year we return to this basic well placed hotel where many world travelers converge  Our kids still love it  Probably not for tourists but more for travelers like those who would love our very inexpensive Tunisian hotel in Paris  
N => Accused of being a liar by the staff  We stayed in Hotel Viger for two days Wednesday and Thursday  On that first Wednesday we asked one of the staff if we could have a late checkout on Friday at  pm  She of course said it would be no problem just make sure we mention it to the girl at the counter the next morning The next day Thursday we mentioned the late check out to the girl with the french accent and she said it would be no problem  We went out and did our sightseeing and had a nice time That Friday we went out to do some shopping when we came back to drop off our bags to the room the girl stopped us and said that we had to check out of the room she said that they needed the room and she asked if the lady really said that we could have a late checkout  She said that the lady never said we could check out late accusing us of lying  What would we have to gain from lying  That made us feel terrible after we just had an enjoyable visit in Montreal  It left a bad taste in our mouth  If we could not have a late check out they could have told us that from the beginning so that we could make other arrangements We had to pack up all of our things and take them to the car  Another sore spot was the parking the lady who had told us we could check out late suddenly changed her tune  She said we had to pay the   for the parking and return the parking pass because the man had to get paid for the parking when clearly the parking pass was paid for the month of e  She then changed her mind and told us we could keep the parking pass until  pm if we gave her another   which we assume she quickly pocketed for herself  She offered to look after our bags until we came back but we had an uneasy feeling and we ided to put all our bags in our car We agreed that for the price of the room we got what we paid for and   was not expensive but it was misleading when the rate is advertised as much lower  It would be better if they had told us straight away what the price would be we would gladly pay it The room was basic just a place to sleep and shower although the towels could have been thicker and a bath mat would have been nice instead of the paper laid on the floor If we had been treated better by the staff we  have stayed again but we would rather pay more for a room and stay somewhere else where we would be treated as valued customers instead of criminals    Helen 
N => Disapointed I booked this hotel last minute  Being a student I was looking for convenience and affordability  While this hotel fit both descriptions I was horrified to realize that I felt neither safe nor comfortable in this hotel  Across the street weas the entire population of street kids and gang members  Three feet from the hotel my boyfriend witnessed a man pull out  crack pipes and I overheard a drug transaction take place  Not all rooms have a bathroom  We were expected to share a bathroom with  other rooms  I met our neighbour before we even had a chance to unpack  He was an overweight old man sitting shirtless and looking intoxicated watching tv with his door open    Needless to say I would need my boyfriend to stand watch at the bathroom door with a shotgun for me to consider taking a shower there  It seems more like a cheap hotel for pimps to take their business too  Luckily if you had made your reservation within  hours you could cancel and get your money back which I did and we stayed elsewhere  Yes it cost me quite a bit more but at least I wasnt fearful for my life  
N => Only good for the location This hotel is only good for the location  It is a prime location   especially during the jazz festival   at night shared bathroom   I thought it was a great find  You are about a  second walk to the jazz festival  You can hear it at night but it wasnt disturbing  The people are nice   they overcharged us but were quick to resolve the problem  Room was OK   if you are a picky person then forget it  Its clean but they dont really clean your room   sometimes our beds were made we got some clean towels  Room is very small but survivable  There is a sink in the room with soap but no kleenex box  The bathroom was a little gross  Sink was clogged the whole time so we had to come back to our room to wash our hands  I stayed there for  nights and the smell in the hallway a mix of pee and weed increased every day  Breakfast was basic   good croissants toast bananas coffee  It was fine for my trip but I would look a other places the next time I go to Montreal   not worth  even for the location  
N => More of a hostel than a hotel My wife booked this hotel for a family vacation  The website pictures looked good and the price was very resonable  After staying in this hotel for four days I would no recommend it The surrounding area was clearly the red light district  I could stand in front of the hotel and see strip bars and x rated video stores in EVERY direction  The parking lot across the street appears to be a gathering spot for a local motorcycle club emphasis on club not gang  They started gathering there in the early evening  The club then proceeded to rev engines and hang out until   in the morning The rooms were incredibly small  Our room had two full sized beds crammed into a very small area  The room had a desk lamp frig TV and a extremely loud external air conditioner  However the room only had one electical outlet  So you had to choose which two devices to plug in  And forget about recharging your cell phone or digital camera The hotel staff was very nice  However many times there was only one person onsite  Since the single employee had to man the front desk they were not able to come to your room if you needed towels or any assitance When we booked our room online they required us to pay for the entire stay prior to checking in  After seeing the hotel I can see why  If I had it to do all over again I would pay a little more money for a better experience  
N => An beautiful image can be an illusion When I saw the information on internet about this hotel I was very charm  for  star   It was looking very great but my experience tell me an other side of that image I know It s a  star hotel So I knew at the beginning It was not a super class hotel but    I had many problems with what they was saying They said the hotel has the AC and Continental Breakfeast and also parking The AC is not able to refresh the room even if you let it open all of the time Also I never saw any muffin or anything like that To be honnest with you for the parking the only thing you have  has a hotel resident  It s you can go away with your car and come back to the parking and you will never be towed but after your time you have to pay again You are suppose to pay at  AM So forget the grace morning You have to go out and pay if you dont want to be towed An other thing  I seen reviews who they were telling that  the security it s a little to much I understand they are in downtown area but they ask too many question about my travel and what I was doiing Your life it s your life they are not suppose to ask question about that Also the toilet take lot s of time to wash  
N => Stay somewhere else This hotel should advertise as a quotby the hourquot establishment  In fact at night         are positioned on corners around this hotel  It is on a street surrounded by       shops and you have to be buzzed into the lobby through a security gate  The room we were shown was dirty used plastic utensils in a drawer food crumbs on a table furniture that hadnt be dusted in God knows how long and the extra blanket that was provided was filthy  this was after we had to wait to check in so that the room could be cleaned  Walking in the room was like going into a slum apartment in NYC and you are expected to pay upfront   probably so you feel locked into staying there rather than fight for your money back  Private bathrooms are optional and we chose a room that had one  It looked fairly clean but the light switch also turns on the fan which sounded like a small plane taking off  The air conditioner that was in the window was  the size of what it should have been and the open parts of the window were not covered  After telling the person at the front desk that we didnt feel comfortable staying there as it in no way was representative of the rooms that were pictured online we were shown another room  the hotels quotVIPquot suite  The second room was easily twice the size of the first and was somewhat better furnished although there was still no phone in the room and appeared to be clean I wasnt in there long enough to thoroughly check but we were expected to walk through a construction site to get to it I was told that the hotel is in the middle of remodling and that this is their best room that usually goes for over  CAN a night  I thought it was ridiculous to have to pass under a worker who was plastering anytime we wanted to get into our room and told the front desk guy as much  I then had to fight with the manager on the phone to get a refund of the money that I had to pay upfront for our stay  I have never been treated so disrespectfully by the manager of a hotel before  He advised me that their  hour cancellation policy would not allow him to refund the full price I had paid  he said he would refund all but two days  We didnt cancel We showed up and the place was completely unacceptable and not at all what was presented on their website  After some more fighting he refunded all but one day which Im currently disputing with my credit card company since we did not cancel but left because it was disgusting  I cant imagine any age group or type of traveler that would feel comfortable staying there  The website shows a kind of quotbarebonesquot place but it wasnt even as good as that I wouldnt recommend this for anyone who would be remotely concerned with hygiene or personal safety  
N => expectation not met We had read the reviews about this hotel and expected that it was a boutique jewel in a wonderful city  The hotel is clean neat but the room was very small   really meant for a solo traveler   and the breakfast that was included in our package price was very disappointing  For a hotel in the middle of Montreal we would have expected french breads and pastries not stale tasteless croissants and mediocre fruit and coffee  The staff is attentive and pleasant   The restaurant recommended to us the first night we arrived was definitely not one we would have chosen and we did end up going elsewhere   we did not want to rely on the staff after that  We also smelled cigarette smoke our last day which I know is not permitted but   it was definitely filling the hall  We did see several rooms our last day that would have been much better   we wondered why the hotel would not let us know that they were available the were better suited for a couple  Especially since there were so many empty rooms  
N => Couldnt ask for a more perfect stay I read all the wonderful reviews for this hotel before I booked but was a little skeptic  After my recent trip to Montreal I wanted to stay in the older part to visits museums and be close to the citys history  This hotel not only was in the heart of that area but it was so classy  My room was fantastic large and super clean  Service was good and very helpful to me  It was a cozy stay especially spending down time by their library and bar  I only recommend that you research restaurants nearby as it does not have one in the hotel  It also doesnt have mini fridges either  But the bar tender was nice enough to bring me tea every evening  Thanks for a stress free vacation  
N => Elegant Choice Without Costing a Fortune I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  I was extremely surprised and very very pleased The room was spacious clean and elegant  Staff was extremely friendly and kind Breakfast was all that it is meant to be generous and filling Great location and I thought the price was very fair Im very happy to recommend this hotel to all  
N => great place We ided on this hotel after reading many reviews on tripadvisor  We were pleased with our room nice high ceilings great bed and linens  They were a little stingy with the towels but we do appreciate their efforts to be quotgreenquot  The hotel is in a perfect location  very close to Old Montreal but not in the thick of it walking distance to most of the attractions in Montreal  The staff was very helpful  Our only complaint was that the shower did not have much pressure and it did not get very warm  All in all a great place to stay  we would certainly go back  
N => Horrible I booked a room at this hotel almost  year before our stay for a wedding  I had aked for two double beds because we were  ppl in our room  I was told no problem  I was also told that we would get the GOVT rate  Two days before our stay  I called the hotel just to confirm our two double beds and govt rate   no problem    We get to our room and guess what We get one queen bed I called the desk an they tell me they are fully booked and cannot give us two double beds I told them that I had booked two beds almost  year ago but they could not do anything  I was actually very polite  too polite  So I asked for  cots  for the two other ppl in our room They told us that they were out of cots but would try to find one  We got  cot about  hours later  So one person had to sleep on the FLOOR for two night in a row Calling the front desk for anything extra pillow blankets cot towels etc  took TWO HOURS to get everytimecheckout We were told that we COULD NOT get govt rate  I then told the guy that we booked two double beds and we ended up with  queen that we should at least get a discount  He told me that its not there fault that they have alot of ppl here for a wedding and cant guarantee anything    so no govt rate as promise dand no discount WHAT I guess you cant reserve specific rooms at this hotel   sooo disorganized  They even thought we had stayd for  night and I had to correct him with the billing  i was too nice Not only that but he was VERY VERY RUDE So now some other guy leaves to go get our car  valet the gets out of the car not syaing a thing  My friend and I are about to get into the car and OMG the drivers window is BUSTED Someone broke into our car  The guy was like quot oh ya hahaha your car got broken intoquot who lhs at that WOW So we go back to the very rude guy at the front desk and tell him what happend  He said that it happend last night  WHAT Last night and you never told us or left a msg in our room HORRIBLE NEVER AGAIN 
N => An Expensive Hotel that lacks the experience to have luxury I attempted to check in to the hotel at PM and I was told to return at PM when I returned at PM I was told to take a seat as my room was not ready yet  Four other couples check in and at PM i asked if it was ready and I was told it was ready an hour ago as I sat in the couch directly infront of the check in area When I got into my room I noticed the  Foot Ceiling and nice window coverings but when I went into the bathroom the vanity was made of x and the tile job lacked grout  The tub was small and the shower leaked all over the place In addtion there is no ice in the motel you must request it from rooom service and the room does not contain a minibar or mini fridge The most dissapointing part was the Breakfast  It was terrible the croisants where not cooked the coffee was tasteless and the Breakfast that I had at the local to my house   per night Holiday Inn Express was a thousand times better Do not stay at this motelhotel Prior to my stay at this hotel I stayed at Hotel Domion  in Quebec and it is an awsome Hotel  
N => Wed definitely go back This was an extremely well located hotel  We were there during the Montreal Jazz Festival and could walk to it as well as to everywhere in the entire Old Town and its also close to the subway  The staff was friendly rooms very nice and breakfast very good  There really wasnt anything to complain about  
N => Not impressed Stayed at the Hotel Xixe Siecle on our honeymoon trip through Canada  We arrived on a weekend  I booked the trip throughExpedia com  On arrival it took about  hours to check in becauseour room wasnt ready and there was a big line because therewere a lot of guests checking in for a wedding party  After our long wait they put us in what seemed like a  foot by foot box of a room that was extremely small  Additionallyin the room next door there was a baby crying which we couldhear very easily through the paper thin walls  When I called thefront desk to ask if we could change rooms they informed us thatall the rooms had been booked for the wedding party  The paint was chipping in the room  The LCD flat screen tvwas probably a  inch tv  The front desk was snooty and not friendly  Out of  hotels with only  star ratings and this being rated  starts this is the worst of the Montreal hotels that I have been to  The others being Sheraton Wyndam Renaissance Hilton etc all much nicer  
N => A little bit overpriced We were at the Hotel two nights from t  and the first night we had a room facing the St Jaques street and we could not sleep at all because of the noise of passing cars  They were doing some kind or road work and the patholes were covered by steel plates and cars going over would make a terrible noise  We complained in the morning and nicely they gave us a new room a suite on the opposite side of the hotel so we would not hear any noise  Both rooms were large and well appointed  The only thing missing in both rooms was a frigo bar that for a  sta hotel we found very odd  We had an all inclusive package roombreakfastparking that with all taxes included brought the price for a night close to  that we found a little bit too much compared to other hotels in Montreal of same category Breakfast was good and location excellent only a few steps from the Notre Dame cathedral  We are not sure we would return to same hotel  
N => First see if theres construction nearby    My husband took me here for a surprise anniversary getaway  The location was great    a block from the subway and a reasonable walk to several parts of town  However street noise was considerable even on Sunday and then at  a m  on Monday construction noise outside was unbearable  Might not be a problem for an early riser but we were really looking forward to a late morning  The desk staff was not at all apologetic I guess what can they doMy husband booked a room with a whirlpool tub and queen bed they upgraded us they said to a quotsuitequot    really just a very large single room  It didnt have the tub wed hoped for but we stayed because it had a king bed  Everything in the room was comfortable I liked the toiletries and the shower was good  The lobby had lots of nice sitting areas  
N => Beware of Bait and Switch We booked a room with two queen beds and when we arrived at about  in the afternoon we were shown to a room with only one bed  When we returned to the desk they said that was a room with two queen beds because it had a sofa bed  They appeared not to have an available room with two beds as we had reserved and were not at all apologetic or offered any discount  Their attitude was take it or leave it  The sofa bed was really cheap about a four inch mattress with a single blanket and no pillows  Even worse the part of the room where the sofa bed was had no curtains  
N => Not as charming as I expected This hotel is in the beautiful old part of Montreal  The room was large and clean however I felt as did another reviewer that the hotel lacked atmosphere  Also there was no free wi fi in the rooms as in most other hotels in canada or free local calls for that matter no mini bar no tea and coffee making factlities although the concierge did bring us complimentary coffee when I asked about this  We found the room very noisey and would recommend you do not overlook the street although interior banging doors are also real problem  The hotel was well priced but i do not think I would return I think we had been spoiled by paying less for a lot more in Toronto  
N => Good but not outstanding I chose this hotel on the strength of the other reviews I found on tripadvisor  Hotel has a good location but I found our room to be fairly basic  It was very spacious though  Staff were friendly and helpful  I dont know what it was    I just felt it lacked atmosphere Overall good but not outstanding 
N => Charming ambience Great location in Old Montreal   roughly two blocks to subway station Square Victoria  Lots of sights and restaurants within   min walk in the area or can subwaywalk up to St  Catherine area  Very friendly hotel staff that provided excellent service and had a few excellent restaurant suggestions  The Hotel quotLibrary Barquot appeared to have a few guests every night we were there albeit it was Formula  weekend in Montreal and every place was quite busy  The rooms itself were charming  Very high ceiling clean and tidy  Bathroom amenities were top notch  Only complaint from me was that Room  did NOT have any wifi reception   I had to literally walk into the hallway or go down into the lobby to get any internet  Inconvenient but a minor problem especially when there was so much more to offer in the city during the weekend I was there  
N => Highest ks This hotel was recommended by a friend knowing of my upcoming trip  He raved about the location service and price  I went with high expectation which were surpassed  All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful  They even let me in their office to print my airline e ticket  Their honest restaurant recommendations were spot on getting us into a popular place on a busy Friday night  The bar tender gave me a few French lessons and help with phrases  We left for  days to see Quebec city and returned to find they had upgraded us to a suite for our final stay Rooms were clean tastful with all the amenities one would expect for this price point  No view to speak of but we didnt care  Our suite was wonderful and spacious  The suite we were in used to be an old bank vault  The room was dead quiet  The bar and lobby area are elegant and great place to relax and socialize  Location is perfect between downtown and old town and near the subway station  We returned to Montreal  months later and were somewhat disappointed  They put us in the same standard room we had on our previous stay  The price had gone up even in the early Spring offseason  None of the staff we encountered were there  It was just a standard hotel experience  Goes to show what a difference good staffing makes  
N => Not disappointed just not impressed  We stayed here for a weekend in il  The location a short walk from the train station Bonaventure even shorter walk to the Metro Square Victoria and just around the corner from Notre Dame Basilica was the best part of staying at XIXeme Siecle  Otherwise the hotel was profoundly unimpressive  It wasnt bad mind you but we just had the sense that they hadnt quite finished reations yet  Fixtures were sub par the room we had was positioned as an upgrade yet the lighting was poor and the bed was some odd size between a double and a queen Value for the money cannot be denied  This was certainly superior to any motel accommodation for a similar price  By no means did we feel that we overpaid and we arent complaining about that at all  However the pictures imply a level of finish and style that simply isnt there with this hotel Breakfast was across the street at Eggspectations  That was good  Id recommend attending the am Mass at Notre Dame  The choir and organ are absolutely fantastic  Reminder not to take pictures during the service  The woman in front of us was doing that and was warned off of that  Sandy at the Front Desk of the hotel was VERY helpful and had excellent dining suggestions  The staff during the day we found not as knowledgeable  Chez LEpicier   Old Montreal not a long walk very nice neighbourhood atmosphere  Quality food well prepared and presented  Holders   West Old Montreal convenient to Metro bistro fare  Less expensive than LEpicier  We need to eat quickly because we had an pm show to catch  Service was delivered with a smile  Le Jardin Nelson   Place Jacques Cartier  Yes   youre right in the heart of touristown but they have a pleasant atmosphere for lunch and our serveuse Elyse was very friendly and helpful  St Denis   We spent a day on St Denis shopping and sitting in cafes  Time well wasted as they say Excellent coffee at La Brulerie there might be more to the name    Youll need reservations for the better restaurants  Sandy at the Front desk was very helpful in getting us in to the first two places mentioned above  Also enjoyable for late night drinks is Crescent Street its party time on a Saturday night   if you enjoy live music there are bands everywhere 
N => Wonderful but not everything I expected   My wife and I just spent a wonderful long weekend in Montreal celebrating our th anniversary  We stayed at the Hotel XIXe Siecle and enjoyed our time there  The hotels location in Old Montreal was convenient for exploring the city and its history and the staff was very willing to please and was extremely helpful in arranging dinner reservations directing us to the best sites to see and making our stay pleasant  However athough we had a great time there seemed to be something missing at the Hotel XIXe Siecle that I just cant put my finger on  It wasnt a bad experience by any account and I would definitely recommend the hotel to others but it wasnt the most amazing either  
N => Home away from home  
N => Good value but something missing    
N => Id recommend Hotel XIXe Siecle  
N => Fantastic Small Hotel in Old Montreal  
N => A NICE PLACE We arrived a couple of hours earlier than check in and were told that we could not check in till pm which was check in time  This was an inconvenience as we had to travel the streets for  hours while all we wanted to do was lay down and sleep for a few hours  
N => WiFi not included I know its a minor thing but the website suggested it was in the room  Like the towels and electricity we assumed it was included  It was not and forced us to use free services elsewhere  The TV was also an extra fee  The sink was plugged whenever we used it  And needless to say we spent as little time here as possible  Good points  The room was clean the beds were made every morning and aside from listening to the FrancoFollies every night it was fairly peaceful on the th or so floor  
N => Clean comfortable good location    but not worth  stars I booked this hotel on Hotwire for about  USDnight  I wouldnt pay much more than that however Good    clean great downtown location comfortable beds friendly staff Bad    its not  star as advertised    sure  The rooms and bathrooms need a little updating  Hotel movie had background quotstaticquot  Not great when you pay   for one The real bad    the air conditioning  It was really warm in Montreal above  degrees  The AC in the rooms couldnt keep up   While we had it on max it was about  degrees in the room  They first came up    said it was broke    theyd send a repair person the next morning and if that didnt work theyd change us to another two double room  And they sent a fan up  Next morning    nothing  We left for the day  Came back    called again    said they would call back in a few  No call  Third time he said hed check into it  Nothing  Friendly but not very organized Talking to other guests    were thinking it wasnt broke and it just sucked to begin with  
N => definitly not a  star hotel Not as good as the other Hyatts  Check in took forever  Valet parking was very slow  Rooms were clean but the bathroom had mold  
N => Not up to Hyatt standards This hotel became a Hyatt in  someone forgot to tell the management as it is being run like a youth hostile  I should have known that getting a rate of just over  was to good to be true  If you are not used to the excellent staff at a Hyatt you be ok  If you are prepared for long line ups at the understaffed front desk no served breakfast buffet only at  cant even get a muffin or a coffee unless you leave the hotel or get the buffet  No restaurant open in the afternoon no newspaper at the door fitness center with machines from   This place just feels cheap not so much the facility as much as the policies and customer service  
N => Variable service The hotel is a little beat up and getting dingy for a Hyatt  But the biggest problem I had was with the service  First let me say that I rarely complain and am a pretty easy traveler  But multiple times I had issues mostly small annoyances with the service that left a bad taste    For example the in room movie system was giving me some sort of fault when I tried to order one of their very expensive movies  After calling the front desk and waiting a day for it to be fixed I called down again  The guy at the desk passed me to a quothelp numberquot that turned out to be the service number the hotel is supposed to call to get their system fixed  Given it was late on a Sunday he had to have known the help line would not be open  It was pretty clear he just wanted me out of my hair   bloody pain in the  amp  American  There were a couple other instances where I thought they were more rude then they needed to be  Some of my colleagues at this conference stayed at the other near by hotels had said they had very good experiences  The convention center is a great place for a conference 
N => Great Location Overrated Hotel   You have to stand on one very LONG line with everyone in the hotel who is checking inchecking outneeds directions or a taxi etc    Our reservations specified one room three people  We were assigned a single room with one bed  A trip back downstairs another long wait on a long line and we were re assigned a double room with two beds    During our  night stay the room was attended to between  pm and pm  The beds were made but the room was not vacuumed or dusted   The bathroom towels were changed but the bathroom was never cleaned  Weve had better service in a Motel  
N => Lousy service but good rooms The rooms are fine if a bit cold with no way to adjust the temp upwards   could just be me but I like it a few degrees warmer and the beds are very comfortable  However call the front desk if you like to hear the sound of a phone ringing   and ringing   with no one answering  If you call room service you get a lovely voice message saying their hours and if youd like to leave a message  No actual room service will speak with you or take an order they apparently dont listen to the voice mail  They have an quoteConciergequot if you want to make a reservation for the hotel restaurant but theres no actual concierge  comfy rooms but otherwise a  star hotel  Try elsewhere  
N => Standard issue hotel    very nice Found a great deal for this hotel on Hotwire    Hotel rooms were stylish and clean staff were friendly  Didnt really get to make good use of the facilities but they seemed good  Two areas for improvement   hallways were extremely dim   I always got the sense that someone would jump out of a dark corner Also the hot water in our room didnt seem to be working all so well   you had to turn the temperature to the maximum heat in order to get warm water  Otherwise well recommended   right across from Place Des Arts Metro and not too far from the Place DArmes metro  
N => good quality sensible city hotel   no medals no brickbats Architecturally this is horrible   a raw concrete block sitting over a shopping mall with the lobby an elevator away from street and taxi level  But that doesnt matter too much once youre inside looking out Service is ok  Check in was quick tho the girl didnt know the answers to most of my questions and had to refer to her colleagues  Check out was slow as there was a queue of guests and not enough staff  Room service was quick and efficient and the food was good  The bellboy was slow to get my stored bags as I left but quick to get a cab  Coffee service in the lobby was willing and friendly The rooms a typical Hyatt room the right size comfortable bed good bath teacoffee in the room  The internet worked well I suspect its as usual for a Hyatt expensive but I had a internet included rate  Breakfast was good plenty of choice and good quality Id picked this hotel as it had an indoor pool that was reputed to be just long enough to swim laps  However at pm on a Sunday it was already shut for the day and didnt open till late morning  As a business traveller with meetings all day this meant that I couldnt use it  Very frustrating  Theres a small gym a bit too much equipment in too small a space So this is an efficient place to stay if youve meetings in this part of Montreal but you wouldnt stay here for a relaxed weekend or an extended period of time  
N => Worst hotel in Montreal Hyatt Regency MontrealWe choose this hotel because of the brand  Booked  King rooms for a week end for family travelling from Europe What a nighte when we got to the rooms it wasnt King bedrooms  We have to insist before the not too friendly staff eventually said I ahve  King rooms for you It wasnt King rooms were smelly paint in bathroom was awful   Nevere saw this before   year old dhter said quotThis is worst than the hotels weve been to in the summerquot  We were in Montreal NYC     always  starsBe careful with this place 
N => A Pig in Lipstick A group of us from Toronto all young people     ided to take a short trip to Montreal to see the sights and celebrate the new year  One of us had heard good things about the Hyatt and seeing as we were able to book at a reduced rate since the hotel was offering an early bird winter special ided to give it a try Right from the get go the service at this hotel was mediocre at best  We initially ordered two rooms and negotiated what we were told was a free breakfast included each day for  people per room usually a  dollar value per day since we were booking  rooms for  nights each  A few days later a few more people entered our party and we needed another room  We called back the same number to find out that while our initial rooms were still booked we couldnt get the same rate for an additional room because the manager had to approve it  We were given her name and number and told to leave a message and she would get right back to us  For the next  weeks we left several phone messages with no return call from the manager  We were re directed to several people who said they couldnt help us  Meanwhile the rate for the room steadily inclined as we reached closer to the new year  Finally  days before our trip we were told the manager we had been trying to reach for nearly a month was on vacation and all the hotel could do was charge us  dollars more per day for the additional room even though they were the ones at fault for not getting back to us sooner  On top of that they claimed that at no time was a free breakfast offered to us When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by bell boys who were fairly friendly and helpful with our luggage  If you want to park in the hotel it costs something like  dollars a day  If you are not planning to use your car and trust me you can get practically anywhere in the downtown area by underground or Metro park next door in the Complex Dejardins the mall directly underneath the Hyatt  It costs  for every  hours as long as you dont leave the complex i e  no in and out privileges  We did this for  days and the car was completely safe underground in a well lit and secure parking lot for only  total  We got to the hotel at around pm our room was ready and check in went smoothly  The rooms are spacious and were clean and tidy  Yes the TV was a little old but it worked and it had enough English channels to entertain us in the little amount of time we did spend in our rooms  The heating was easy to adjust and adapt to your own liking  The bathroom was clean my only complaint being that there was very little counter space ladies your make up bag wash kit and hair products will not fit very well in the bathroom at all  However several things went wrong over the course of  days including one complete room change half way through due to a malfunctioning shower  Im not the type to do much complaining or be too picky but heres a list of the things that went wrong in our rooms in  days that the hotel did little to nothing to help remedy the situation in any way  Shower head that was broken and dangling from its perch with water that switched every  seconds from absolutely freezing to scalding hot  Took  days for maitenence to come in and out before switching us to another room completely because they couldnt do anything apparently   however another couple was booked in that room a few hours after we left meaning they knowingly booked someone in a room with a broken shower   occasions where the rooms were not cleaned and no one responded when we called down to ask for someone to come up because the room was missed    TVs that had blown speakers that would ring if you turned them up past a certain volume  Electrical outlets that would not work at all  Fire alarm in the middle of the night from  am to  am with no compensation i e  in terms of offering food blankets drinks etc  to those waiting out in the cold in their PJs half asleepIn my opinion when it comes down to it   for the amount of money you pay to stay in the hotel you get little to no service and many of the amenities youd expect to be free local phone calls are   each or cheap wireless internet cost  dollars a day for access are not included  I have had better stays at howard johnsons or days inns than here  Mind you the location is amazing and you are in walking distance of just about all the major attractions For advice on eating   try Jiggs Fritere downstairs in the food court  Very cheap but tasty food especially the poutins and breakfast served till   For dining out the Baton Rouge was terrible service and food try St  Huberts the French version of Swiss Chalet for great prices and great food  Didnt find any bagel places in close vacinty to the hotel but a quick drive down St  Laurent will take you to Shwartzs Deli which has amazing Montreal smoked meat For sights we went to the Biodomebotanical gardensinsectariam biodome is the best by far and not to be missed in my opinion shopping on Rue St  Catherine the other street the Hotel borders which is a street lined with shops mostly clothing although I didnt see many different from the ones found in Toronto  We also went to the Cathedral Notre Dame which is within walking distance and GORGEOUS  Anyone with an appreciation of historyreligionarchitecture should not miss this  For nightlife we only really went out one night on new years to a party at club soda down the street  But from what I can see St  Laurent and St  Catherine  streets within walking distance from the hotel are littered with bars pubs and clubs  Im sure you could find a great party to go to every night within stumbling distance from the hotel  Dont be afraid to take the metro and the bus system Its incredibly fast and efficient and all have maps of popular destinations and which stopsbuses to take to get there  Also you can get to almost anywhere by taking the underground paths which are well lit and easy to navigate if you pay attention to the maps and arrows Lastly dont be nervous if you do not speak French very wellat all  Most people speak nearly perfect English and if not they know enough to tell you what you need to know  It was actually mind blowing to see how efficiently bi lingual most Montrealers are  We got some attitude a few times for being obvious English tourists from Ontario but it was slim to none and for the most part Montrealers are extremely nice and helpful people  Plus we met many other Torontonians Ottawers and Americans in the hotel which was a fun experience  Overall Id give the hotel a  out of   A great location and aesthetically pleasing however much to expensive for the services offered  There are many other hotels in the area which I would recommend checking out before this one  
N => Close to perfect  We first arrived late evening  The valet attendants were very friendly and helpful and took our bags from the trunk and guided us where to go to check in  The front desk was also very friendly and by the time we got our keys and went to our room our bags were delivered to us mins later   Very impressed  Our rooms we booked  were freezing along with the hallways  The front desk told us how to turn on the heat but left out one major key point  When turning down the round dial button to off counter clockwise you then have to turn the thermostat up  We had a technician come   who was also very pleasant  Once that was sorted we were just fine  So far so good    The beds were INCREDIBLE  It was just like sleeping on a cloud  Anyone who wants a very good night sleep   this is the place to be  The fitness area was also very nice  There is a fully loaded gym with a beautiful swimming pool  The bar   never got a chance to have a drink was also very nice but not many people in there As for someone mentioning in a previous review about being charged for more towels   I did heed his advice and asked for an itemized bill  I saw that they did not charge me the full  for parking as I hadnt parked for the full hrs  So in my opinion the hotel was rather gracious in that respect Overall   Id give this hotel a  out of   Ive stayed in many hotels and I have to say this one was fantastic  Great location also  
N => Great location Our most recent trip to Montreal was just overnight for a festival amp we stayed at the Hyatt  We had no problems checking in even though we arrived quite late  The hotels location is wonderful right outside the hotel is where quite a few events are held  Our festival wasnt but it was easy enough to find  The room was quite small with no real view to speak of but it was clean amp very comfortable which is what matters since we werent there for the hotel amp did use priceline for a great price  We didnt make use of all the amenities the hotel offers since it was a short trip but would stay againThe only annoyance we had was the elevator to get to the reception area  One very slow elevator ride not going very far when we would have loved to see some stairs  We didnt find another way in be there was 
N => Nice Hotel BUT NO SERVICES due to workers strike  LOUSY I am currently in nd of  night stay at this hotel  It is a nice hotel with nice rooms lobby nice pool direct access to underground mall and internal access to subway great location BUT the hotel workers are all on strike and all the power to them you have to fight for your rights and I totally support that  My beefs   I was warned upon checkin that there was no room service pool was closed yikes but was told there was limited housekeeping not NO housekeeping which is the exact situation  The VERY least they could have done is given me additional shampoo etc in the bathrooom and additional towels at the beginning but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI have asked twice for these basic amenities but NOTHING  I am out of shampoo and conditioner which is fine if I hadnt been told they would be delivered to my room but twice requested and NOTHING   I am running low on towels as well and my garbages are overflowing The least this GARBAGE hotel could have done is pre warned their guests so they could cancel but I had prepaid this hotel and they will not refund my money I will be writing to their head office BUT do not anticipate a response I will certainly never utilise HYATT again  They cant treat their own employees right let alone their guests  
N => Was shocked and appalled Was shocked and appalledI am a semi frequent traveler and yet this is the first hotel review I have ever written in this forum probably because my time at The Hyatt Montreal so motivated me to do so I short I was a horrible terrible experience  I planned a vacation in Montreal and called a month in advance to book a suite for  per night  When I got there at  pm on a Thursday night there was a long line at the counter  It took me over  minutes just to check in Needless to say they had no suites and asked if I would take a different type of room smaller  I said no I had booked a suite  So after a lot of bickering back and forth they found a room  It was really two small rooms with an adjoining doorway to make it a quotsuite quot To say it was dissapointing would be an understatement The room was not really dirty or anything but just tired and cramped  It had the look of being used for many years  BUT the furniture was unbelievably cheap  And the room was small and cramped  And the bathroom was tiny  This was a two star hotel not a one star but by NO means a three star hotel  The Internet would not work  They have no in house service so I had to call a   number and wait on hold for another  minutes litterally and then was told it would be  for service to get me on line  Then they were never able to get me on line We called room service  It took over ninety  minutes to get a very cold hard dry hamburger and a wilted salad with gross fries  In the tiny bathroom there was grime on the molding everywhere  It took forever to get the warm water to run  It was just dark and dank  There were no yellow pages in the room  It took the concierge well over an hour to get it there  Everything about this hotel was wrong wrong wrong  Lines for all services and long delays  The bar area was depressing  It was just like being a piece of steer hoarded into a cattle car  We checked out the next day and will never go back  Just terrible  
N => good hotel okay location    We booked our stay through the montreal tourism website we paid  for the st night   off the second night  It was a pretty good deal considering that it included daily buffet breakfast  The breakfast was wonderful every possible choice including fresh omelettes made to order  Hotel was clean staff friendly  My only concern was that we were told that we were connected to underground shopping I assumed that it would be connected to the eaton center somehow but it wasnt  You have a mall complexes dejardins downstairs but youll have to walk a couple of blocks before you get to the main shopping area  This hotel is quite far from the main area too east next time Im going to stay at a hotel more on the west end but Ill definitely miss the buffet breakfast 
N => No Hyatt IM a frequent business traveler and have stayed in many Hyatts as I am a Hyatt passport member  Past year or so I began to have bad experiences with the hotels my company booked me in so I started to use Tripadvisor to nevigate hotes in citiestowns I was going to be in to book a room  The Hyatt in Montreal was depressing  The location is good the staff is rude and snobby  Rooms are OK but for  it should be good or great  I was disappointed this hotel is not a real Hyatt and it damaging to the Hyatt Brand  I expect high standards from Hyatt that why I shove out the big bucks  I will not be staying here again  
N => mixed review room was nice and clean  housekeeping was exceptional  I had a problem with lack of concierge  Advise was more of a joke to the staff and infomration was not reliable and bordered on the front desk doing a practical joke  I would prefer to stay somewhere else  Some staff showed extreme professionalism but the experiences by the rest overshadowed any positive aspects the hotel offered  Great location  In short the front desk leaned on the juvenile side  McDoanls employees showed more professionlism and this hotel is not up to Hyatt standards outside the tangible room  
N => Tried to overcharge average rooms While the hotel lobby and location is nice the room was very plain and average  Definitely not a four star hotel in room quality  The towels were thin and I had to ask for more  I discovered they charged an extra  in incidental fees for room service just for bringing more towels Worst of all the hotel tried to overcharge us  We reserved a room for  and I was shocked to see my credit card statement show the bill ended up   The hotel staff said it was for a cleaning fee for smoking in a non smoking room but we have NEVER smoked in our entire lives so this was nothing more than a rip off attempt  The hotel said they would reverse the charge  If you stay here be sure to get an itemized receipt and look over it carefully  
N => A fabulous Montreal experience A very high class hotel right in Montreals Place de Arts district  It sits atop a large underground mall which is part of Montreals underground walkway and commercial center  The staff were nice and the room was magnificent  Definitely one of the most comfortable beds Ive slept in  Elevators were slow and difficult to catch as was the concierge due to the long line  But when I finally got to him he was more than willing to explain the French city to me  
N => Noisy and dark We also stayed at the Hyatt Montreal during the film festival and experienced the same things as the previous reviewer  Some things   such as how busy it was   were surely attributed to the festival but others are just general issues with the hotel itself The location cant be beat   its right in the center of town but other than that there is nothing rekable about the hotel  Reception is reached via elevator which is somewhat annoying since once you get to reception you have to take a different set of elevators to get to your own floor  be it was me but the elevators seemed like they took FOREVER and there are  of them  The hotel was recently refurbished but its so dimly lit that the whole place seems outdated already  Rooms are the same way   barely lit even with everything turned on  Bathrooms are small  Also watch out for parties going on outside in the ballroom  Our room faced outside and all we heard was thumping bass at pm   not what you want to hear after a long flight  We subsequently changed rooms but I would think this would be a problem every week if the ballroom was rented out  I was very close to switching to the Queen Elizabeth after our first night but our great rate  CAN kept me there  I personally wouldnt stay here again  
N => Very busy hotel We satyed here for  nights during the Montreal Film festival we didnt know the festival was on until we arrived as part of a  week trip around Eastern Canada The hotel is in a great location close to great shops sites restaurants etc  But my oh my it is so busy  You access the hotel reception via a lift two only available for this and we had to wait ages every time for the lift to arrive We needed reception  times during our stay check in picking up a letter and cheking out and each time we had to wait for between  and  minutes To be fair to the reception staff they were lovely to every guest and gave everyone time and did not rush anyone   they were so patient  There was only one exception to this and this was a more mature gentleman on reception when I was checking out and he left me feeling as though I was beneath him   his attitude was dismissive The main lifts to the bedroom were also busy and you had to wait ages for one to come  Our room was lovely   clean spacious and comfortable so no compliants on that front at all We used both the pool and the gym and both were lovely with a very pleasant area to sit out on a sunny day Breakfast was a buffet and was a very good standard Overall a good experience but being so constantly busy was somewhat frustrating  Perhaps the film fesitval had something to do with it this 
N => Not the flagship Hyatt The hotel staff is very friendly and welcoming  However they dont always get everything right the first time  We requested two beds on our website reservation and were initially given a one bed room  After we checked out we noticed an error on our bill and had to go back and get it fixed  Then when we checked our credit card online we saw quotpendingquot charges for both the uncorrected and corrected bill eventually this self corrected perhaps this was a credit card quirk  Our complicated alarm clock CD player had been left for us with the alarm set to go off at  am  which it did  It took me several minutes to figure out how to turn the alarm off I doubt they train their maids to check and turn off alarms and there is nothing intuitively obvious about how to turn off the alarm  At check in it was suggested that we might want to upgrade to the club floor and were told that even though the bar in the club lounge was an honor bar where we were supposed to sign for our drinks to be charged to our room no one checked to see if we really signed for our drinks   The hotel occupies the lower  floors of a much higher building  Our first night was a high school prom night with a loud band on floor   On our floor  you could hear the band softly until about am  A quirk is that it takes  elevators to get to the street   A plus is that there is a metro stop a block away and it can be reached wo going outside if the weather is bad  The hotel is part of a mall complex that extends underground  This was our second stay at the hotel and we would consider staying there again but only for a quotgood deal quot There is nothing special about this hotel that would make me want to pay a premium to stay there  However despite this griping it provided a comfortable secure pleasant friendly environment   As a pleasure traveler I would prefer on a future visit to stay in the old city  I found it lovely to walk in a source of great restaurants and unlike Quebecs old city not too tourist trappy  
N => Regret this choice I travel to Montreal several times a year and thought I would try a different hotel to get a feel of a different part of the city  This hotel was the choice and unfortunately I regret making it  I will start off with the positives     the reception staff very nice and friendly when checking in     room had a lovely view as requested of Place Des Art  The beds were alright The negatives     dont know where the housekeeping staff are      was out shopping all morning and came back around pm and room still wasnt made up  If you wish to surf the internet using the hotels high speed make sure it is stated in your room rate otherwise you will be paying   per day  I have reviewed the website and nowhere or atleast I cant find it does it state that there is a charge for this service  They do list the prices for Valet Parking but the dont tell you about the internet charges  Oh but you will find out once you get into your room  We also had breakfast in the Cafe Fleury and lets just say I am glad I didnt have to pay for that as it was part of the rate If you stay on any floor higher than the th floor be ready to have a long walk to find a vending machine to get a drink as the vending machines are only on floors  thru  ice however is on every floor    although not much good if you dont have a drink to mix with the iceNext time I travel to Montreal I will return to the hotel that I normally frequent  
N => Nothing too exciting but served its purpose My husband and I just returned from a  night stay at the Hyatt  We booked our room through Hotwire at night so at that price we cant complain but I would never pay full price to stay at this hotel We ended up self parking at the Complex Jardins for CADday the Hyatt valets in the same lot for CAD a day but you get in and out privileges if you ide to go that route  Check in was a breeze but its true you have to take one set of elevators to get to the lobby and another set to the room floors  They granted our request of one king bed but only put us on the rd of  floors when we had asked to be on a high floor other info the fitness center thats open  hours is small but has all new machines weight and cardio related stuff and was never crowded when we went  The bathroom was darker but I thought there was sufficient light at the mirror  One day we left our room at am returned at  PM and our room still was not made up yet Overall we appreciated the hotel for its price and superb location but I wouldnt suggest anyone pay full price to stay at this hotel As far as some restaurants in Montreal I highly recommend Au Pied de Cochon and Bonaparte for dinner Schwartzs for smoked meat sandwiches and Olive and Gourmando for pastries  
N => Surprisingly Disappointing for a Hyatt Ive stayed at this hotel a year ago for a trade show and was very please with the service and the room  So I booked my team to stay here again but I was very disappointed during our recent stay My room was dark  Even with all the lights turned on it made getting dressed and applying makeup very difficult  When taking a shower it seemed like the bathroom was lit by a single candle After  minutes on the telephone with their high speed wireless internet access provider I finally got my laptop connected  I paid for  days but lost connection on the second day and could not be bothered to go through the long process of calling again  After a long day  a few of us were looking forward to a swim in the pool before dinner but was told that the pool closed at pm The bed was comfortable  The room was clean  Soundproofing was okay  Such a convenience to walk through the underground mall to the Palais Des Congres  Especially when it was  C outside The customer service was inconsistent  I did not see a smile on any of the employees when I checked in sat in the lounge area for a drink or when checking out  I moved to another hotel for my final night in Montreal  
N => Pool closed all morning I booked for the gorgeous indoor pool just to find out when I got there that the pool only opened at  pm on weekdays  My  year old dhter was terribly disappointed and I was outraged considering the price I paid to guarantee a fun time at the pool night for the ch Break  
N => Pleasantly surprised I always check out reviews before I book a hotel here and based on the mixed reviews for this hotel I was pleasantly surprised  I am a pretty tough person to please and this honestly wasnt bad  We booked for about  US a night on the Montreal tourism site and received some nice gifts including casino coupons and free breakfastPros Location especially in winter was great  direct access to metro and underground shopping  Ask for a view of Mont Royal  gorgeous  About  min  walk to Old Montreal St  Catherine shopping and many sites  Only CN to self park or was really modern think W without the price The bar and restaurant was totally cool  Try to get free breakfast  made to order omlettes by a cookchef super fresh fruit oatmeal pancakes and delicious pasteries etc Everyone spoke perfect English which is nice  Staff was very friendly and helpful Cons Bathroom was definitely dark bed was not as comfortable as advertised but there are down blankets and lots of pillows  There is a refrigerator coffee and mugs someone apparently couldnt find them next to the coffeepot in another review  The pool looked nice but skip the quotspaquot  Massages and facials were inexpensive but you had to check in with the pool boy  just skip it Overall I would like to try a different hotel next time just to see what other ones in the area are like riott looked nice and was closer to Old Montreal but was pleasantly surprised for the price  If you find something much less expensive try it  But dont hesitate to book this hotel if the price is right  
N => Hyatt more like Motel  Definatley not worth the moneyTheir quotqueen bedsquot are more like a double No minibarCoffee maker with no amenities and if you want a glass or mug or coffee they charge a room service fee for brining it upBathrooms are so dark you need a flash light Shower curtain smells like mold and tobbaccoSome staff were helpfull while others make you wait an hour before helping you even when their not doing anything  
N => Just cause its a Hyatt doesnt mean its any good  The rooms are dingy The washrooms are small with tiny tubs and old rusting fixtures The showers are small and dark   you have to leave the curtain open to see what youre doing The wallpaper is peeling The staff are rude The room was freezing When we arrived there were drunk teenagers hanging out in the foyer  We were woken by drunk people in the hall at am  probably the teenagersTheres no minibar service  Not even unrefrigerated bottles of water to purchase After our late flight we tried to order room service  We were informed that the kitchen was closed for holiday hours im not sure which holiday falls in the middle of ruary  We called the barrestaraunt to see if it was open   the voice on the other end said quotclosedquot and hung up on us When we asked where we could find something to eat we were told quotnowhere   everything in the area is closedquot We walked half a block in one direction and found a restaurant  A takeout menu wouldve been fine too   the staff was not helpful in the least  The photos on the Hyatt website must have been taken the minute the rooms were reated  They certainly arent an accurate representation of the hotel and worst of all for this substandard experience it wasnt cheap  
N => Handy for the city Spent one night here in   as a prelude to a  night skiing holiday in Tremblant Hotel is easy to find and located very centrally as part of the Complex Desjardins  Unfortunately our stay coincided with the Canadian Liberal Party conference which meant the hotel was lively good but also very busy less good Check in was ok but we had to take a double bed instead of  singles   luckily I was travelling with my brother but this could have been an issue on a business trip  We had to ring up before our bags arrived in our room but I am willing to put this down to the busy ness of the hotel that night Room was good   roomy and comfortable but minibar was empty  Didnt have diiner at the hotel but the bar was totally over run by the conference   it was also expensive closed early  I think and ran out of beer   not very good Breakfast the next day was brilliant though   wide selection very fresh and lots of cook to orders available   waiting staff were superb  Check out was painless  
N => Disappointment at the Hyatt Just returned from a week at the Hyatt in Montreal  I was disappointed with the overall condition of the hotel compared to other Hyatt properties I have enjoyed  The hotel was very dark with low ceilings in the halls dark coloured walls and poor lighting  The bathroom in our room was very poorly lit and you could not see yourself in the mirror to properly apply makeup  The grout around the tub was dirty Each time you entered the hotel you had to take two elevators as the main foyer is located on the fourth floor of the hotel  This was very inconvenient as there were often large groups of people waiting for the elevator We had specified in our reservation there would be three people in the room yet we repeatedly had to ask for the right amount of towels coffee cups glasses etc  After we checked out we realized we had left a cell phone charger in the room  The staff insisted there was nothing left in the room and were very unco operative Overall we expected more from a four star hotel  
N => Loved the or The goodprice on Pricelinelobbycondition of lifts and corridorslarger than normal size of roomattractively furnished and orated roomfridge lights in bathroomfresh towelsposition  walked everywhereviewfully reated bathroomeasy acess to shopsThe bad sets of lifts to reach roomsmell of barbeque sauce in sreet entranceinternet   charges noon to noon I enjoyed my stay and would definately stay again  
N => Nice Stay We just returned from a long weekend visit to the Hyatt in Montreal  We had a great weekend and the Hyatt added to our pleasant stay  We stayed in  Fab The free drinks we were offered upon check in  We tried checking in early about pm and the desk clerk said no problem and proceeded to let us know that our smoking room with two double beds was available  My husband is approx quot so I asked if it was possible to change our room to a king sized bed  After searching on her computer for a few moments ia said that she could certainly accomodate our wishes but that the room wouldnt be ready for  minutes  I was very pleased and was not at all upset about waiting  min especially since we were checking in so early  ia then proceeded to offer us free drink coupons so we could enjoy a cocktail while we waited A very pleasant way indeed to start a visit  As mentioned in other reviews this hotel is in an excellent location for accessability to all that is going on  The reations mentioned in other reviews seems to have been completed although we did not try out the pool but did look in  Baton Rouge the restaurant downstairs on Rue St  Catherine was a fun place to eat  Their ribs are perfect and they make a delicous Sangria  THe streetside dining is great for people watching Not so Fab Regulating the room temp seemed a bit tricky either the air was stagnant or it felt like an ice box  Since we didnt spend too much time in the room and the bed was very warm and comfortable this wasnt a big deal  Also as noted in other reviews the bathroom lighting is oddly dim although I did notice that the lighting was relaxing  The window with views of Rue St  Catherine and Rue Jeanne Mance was very dirty  We would stay here again for sure  I will say though that next time we will research the parking situation better  We parked at Place des Arts based on another travellers review and ended up paying more for parking than we would have for valet  The parking garage at Place des Arts charges from midnight to midnight not the actual number of hours your vehicle is parked  IE If you leave early in the morning thinking your car has only been in the garage for  hours you will be charged for a full  OUCH 
N => Just average Stayed here the weekend of    with a deal through Priceline  We arrived just as everyone else was arriving for the weekend and had to wait quite a while for check in  When I finally did get to the desk they told me all they had available was two doubles in a smoking room I had specifically requested a king in a non smoking room  The desk clerk mentioned a few times that my booking was through Priceline as though I wasnt aware of this  After a bit of discussion I was told that a room would not be available until later in the day and that I would have to wait to check in  I reluctantly agreed and requested that a crib be sent to the room for my infant dhter  When we finally got in to the room later that day the crib was still nowhere to be seen  I called and was told that they were quotout of cribsquot and that I would simply have to go without  After telling them this was unacceptable the duty manager got involved and promised that a crib would be sourced somewhere else  Fortunately they managed to find one and everything turned out OK Other than these minor mixups everything else was OK  The rooms arent really up to the standard Ive come to expect from Hyatt  As was mentioned in a few other reviews the bathrooms are poorly designed with only one small spotlight above the sink  I also noticed a lot of mildew and peeling grout around the tub and a broken drain plug  Not what I would have expected from a Hyatt  Im not sure if Id stay here again   there are several other hotels in the area I think are better value for the money such as the Springhill Suites in Vieux Montreal  However the deal through Priceline made it a good bargain for us What I liked Central location close to everything clean and well maintained pool and gym area pleasant staffWhat could be improved Room or bathroom maintenance room size 
N => Hyatt Montreal Beware I arrived  th for a conference for an organization where I am an executive director of the board  I was disappointed that the guest basket that the organization paid for was delivered a room other than the one to which I was eventually booked  Several members of the board also did not receive their gift baskets  Seems that no one could really deermine why the very pricey baskets did not reach their intended destinationsI was on the th floor and the room was extremely dark even with all the lights turned on  I did not find the room up to the standards of the Hyatts that I have stayed at previously The business center consists of one room with one older computer  I needed to ship some items back to the States but no boxes or other packing material in the quotbusiness center quot The concierge suggested that I call housekeeping for a box  I received a box that had previously held  rolls oftoilet tissue Be advised that if you make purchases in the gift shop or order room service and charge your room you will not get a receipt but will be told that you can get one at the front desk when you check out  I will not stay here again  The line staff are very willing to please but the general management could use some additional customer service training  
N => Average for  Stars A quotnicequot hotel comfortable but nothing to rave about  The chamber staff here needs to learn how to make a bed   they were using a small flat sheet as the bottom sheet of the bed so you roll over once and the bedding is in a wad  Although I agree that the lighing in the bathrooms was not great it was adequate  It could have been better but not a reason to avoid this hotel The bell staff lost my wifes bag a BIG problem   and we have not had much satisfaction from the hotel  There is certainly a wide variety of places in Montreal to stay   we pricelined this one   and worked out for us with the exception of the lost bag  
N => Great Place to Stay Just come back from  day stay at Hyatt Regency and have to say everything was excellent All staff we came into contact with from Front Desk to Bar and Restaurant staff were polite professional and very friendly  Always greeted us with a smile and were more than willing to talk about the best places to visit in their city  They switched from French to English effortlessly and went out of their way to be accommodating Recommended a good day trip out to Quebec a beautiful town and advised us on the best  and most cost effective way of getting their   take the bus its more reliable than the trains    good advise Only little negative point was the lack of lighting in the bathrooms but Id already read about that and can see where people are coming from but the concierge advised us that they have taken this on board and are rectifying the problem at the moment  Nevertheless still a very enjoyable place to stay Well done guys  
N => Not too bad  About average  The hotel was ent  Its about what Id expect for a lower average four star hotel  The bathrooms have very little light ultimately leading to showering in the dark  Other than a few gaffs here and there the stay was alright  I am returning to the Montreal Hyatt this week  
N => Zero service zero charm We stayed there over NYE and would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you get a super deal or have very low expectations  From check in to check out we had minimal service  The room was dark the bathroom cramped and the bed hard with these polyester like sheets  Having paid  Canadian a night we were expecting better  And be it was the holiday weekend but the lobby was filled with high schoolers with their alcohol induced rants and ripped jeans  I have not stayed at a Hyatt for a while now and am not inclined to do so again  
N => Dont stay at the Hyatt in Montreal We stayed for  days at the Hyatt Regency in Montreal  It was expensive and not worth it  Our complaints poor housekeeping the room staff shorted us on toilet paper kleenex left dirty glasses in the room and did not replace them made our bed with sheets so short they pulled out every night we slept on them the bathroom very dimly lit with one tiny bulb no close up shaving mirror no full length mirror in the room had to wait an average of  to  minutes to get into the breakfast buffet on the weekends the manager put some people together at a large table and ignored the rest of us when he saw someone he knew he asked quotHow long have you been waitingquot When she answered quot minutesquot he said quotOh thats not so bad quot very nasty service at breakfast we were afraid to ask our waitress for something  she was so irritable  Another table complained about her and the manager said quotbe shes just having a bad day quot Sometimes silverware was missing at breakfast and newspapers were not available  When we asked for a newspaper we were told that if the manager had time he would try to find us one  Then he gave a newspaper to a man sitting near us  We asked the concierge for the address of a restaurant  He gave us the wrong address and we walked for a half hour in the wrong direction until we found someone who knew the restaurant  All in all this was a bad experience  There are so many problems this hotel needs to address from physical facilities to attitudes that we cannot see how they will ever improve  Until they do do not stay at the Hyatt Regency in Montreal  
N => Delightful Beautiful accommodations comfortable rooms friendly service great location Every staff member we met was warm and helpful  The Hyatt Montreal Centre Ville helped make our first visit to Montreal a memorable one  Thanks 
N => Stay Away This place was terrible the staff is arrogant and can not speak good English  If you do not know French do not stay here  They screwed up my hotel billing and lost my reservation  I brought my printed reservation and showed it to them  They did nothing  Terrible place  
N => The Hyatt was great We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal     through      The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful from check in bellman to maid service  Our room was very clean and had been recently refurbished  There is an underground mall accessible by elevator with restaurants we recommend the Baton Rouge shopping and a ket  We didnt experience any of the probelms mentioned in prior reviews  Perhaps the reations are complete  We throughly enjoyed our stay  Incidentally we booked through Priceline at a very good rate and were treated no differently  
N => Guest Rooms have been reated   but the bathrooms YUCK The Hyatt has finished reating all of the guest rooms   and they have done a great job The rooms have been   redone   and have an upscale contemporary look amp feel  Beds are very comfortable   pillow top mattress   duvet   nice linens   but no feather bed and the pillows were rather limpflat  They dont use fitted sheets   so every morning we looking at the exposed mattress   a Sealy The only thing they forgot was the bathrooms   they havent been updated since the hotel opened in the s   I am surprised they did not include them in the reations   they definately need it The phone in our bathroom did not work   the sink was cracked and the faucet leaked  Wall paper was showing wear amp tear   and there was noticeable water damage amp black mold around the tub  Towels were standard motel quality   a disapointment Rooms are not equipped with mini bars   which we thought was quite odd  No in room safes either High Speed internet worked very well   CAD   day but it is only available in  of the over  guest rooms More french than english TV channels normal for Montreal   We were continually channel surfing for something in English to watch No free movie channels Excellent location   walking distance to most tourist attractions We ordered  beers from room service   CAD each   but after taxes and fees   these  beers cost   CAD Front desk recommended the nearby Alto Pizza   dont do it was awfulWe will be back   but only if we can get the same   CAD rate The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is our first choice but their standard Fairmont rooms are considerably smaller than the Hyatt  
N => Can Am guests be aware you will be Poorly treated First let me mentionned that this has nothing to do with Can AM  We were booked there as hockey guests for our biggest tournament ever entered  We traveled all the way from Rhode Island  First on arrival they could not take care of our luggage and we had to make numerous trip back and forth from our tour bus to the lobby which is a lot of work considering this hotel layout  Some of us were able to find help  Upon checking in we came to find out that they had split our team onto different levels  Their explanation was that the rooms were not booked at the same time Bull Upon talking to other hockey guests we came to realize that they had done this to ALL the TEAMS entering the Can Am Tournament  Their SECURITY was on our tail the entire time  They were rude rude rude the entire time and would not even step aside if encountere in the lobby on in the hallway  The pool facility was open to  guests maximum and this of course include the people sitting down  The pool attendants were too busy to keep an eye on the kids they were fixing their chairs and towels so that us parents were left to stand on the outside watching our children through a glass bay  One good thing it the location  Please do your team a favor and pick a nice Holiday Inn in Pointe Claire  
N => Probably the worst place I ever stayed at Where to start We stayed there last ust end of the month  I reserved via priceline and wished I bid lower Regardless of what I paid the most unpleasant part of our stay included drilling yes drilling directy above our room at am  Most other guests at check out were also venting their discontent but the staff appeared tired of defending the hotel  It was not their fault but nobody alerted guests that major reations were going on The rest of the room was very dreary and old  I suppose that was why the quotdrillingquot was going on  I had a car since I was there for business  I had to park across the street  It was inconvenient  Theres an underground parking garage I believe but it was a lot more expensive  As a rule dont get a car in Mtl unless you have to and thats if you are lucky to get out of the misery of Dorval airport to your hotel I am a former Montrealer and have seen this property change hands a number of times  This was also a Meridien and Westin at some point  The numerous changes cannot be a good sign So yes it was cheap but I got what I paid for  One more note I had breakfast in their restaurant the preceding Summer  One  waitress for a whole restaurant  Sub par food as well never thought you could screw up eggs  Its just a matter of time before the place changes hands again  Finally I think the Mtl Hyatt Regency is only a reflection of the seediness found directly east on Ste  Catherine street  Dont go until they finish their reations and even then    
N => Pretty Bad Heres what I think is GOOD about the hotel  The facility itself is nice and the location is good The service is TERRIBLE  Examples  Room Service Twice didnt get our order right and once there was hair in my food   Housekeeping Didnt vaccuum didnt have sheets that fit the king sized bed or at least didnt have fitted sheets so the bottom sheet always ended up halfway down the bed  Left us with no toilet paper or tissues and we had to call three times within  minutes to get some brought to us   Valets We would sometimes be ignored while waiting to ask someone to get our car while the valets chatted  Sometimes while we were patiently waiting someone would come after us and the valets would go to them first  Once the wrong car was brought to us   Concierge Kept us on hold for over  minutes   Front desk Tried to put over  US on hold even though we had PREPAID our room through priceline which only totalled about  US  They never told us how they arrived at that amount since we had only spent about  US when they tried to put additional monies on hold there wasnt enough room on our credit card  We gave them another credit card to hold the money on and although we paid cash when we checked out  DAYS AGO they still havent removed the holds from EITHER of our credit cards although we have repeatedly asked them to and they said they removed the first hold a week ago  Another problem we had with the front desk Local calls are   but charges for internet service through a high speed modem are time based  We called the front desk specifically to ask if we got online throug a LOCAL NUMBER would we be charged   or would it be time based  We were told it would only be    We specifically asked quotSo even if I stay online for an hour it will only be  quot The answer    quotyesquot  Of course when we checked out this was not the case and we had to spend about  minutes at the front desk disputing the amounts and finally getting them removed All I can say is BAD BAD BAD service  
N => Treated Like An Inferior Guest I used priceline to book a room at The Hyatt Regency Montreal  My impression is the staff at this hotel do not feel a priceline guest is really a guest of their hotel  I was made unwelcome from the beginning  I had confirmed a non smoking room with a king bed on the Hyatt web site  When I arrived I was told I was in a smoking room with a double bed  I informed the clerk I had confirmed my reservation for a king bed  He said quotYou booked on line thats all we have quot After much discussion I was offered my reservation but I had to wait an hour to get it  My bags were put in storage I returned in an hour and got my room but my bags were locked in storage and no one had key to storage room  I was told my bags would be in my room in  minutes  I returned to front desk  minutes later and still no one could get me my bags  I told the staff that I needed my luggage immediately because I soon had a dinner date  I might as well of saved my breath not one of the staff seemed to care that I could not get my bags  There was no sense of urgency  I asked for the manager who promised to get the key to the storage room and have my luggage to my room in  minutes  Well I finally got my luggage but it was  minutes later  All said it took   hours to get my room and my luggage to my room I would never have expected this sort of attitude from such a chain as the Hyatt  Needless to say I will avoid staying at this hotel again  
N => avoid this place if you can  
N => Minimum de services  
N => Great hotel with great location  Great hotel and great location  From arrival in our car to departure the whole stay was wonderful  Check in was effortless the bags arrived in our room very quickly and the car was ready out front as soon as we had called for it Lady concierge was wonderful   so helpful The or was lovely with fine attention to detail  The carpets cushions and pillows made a warm but plush atmosphere All good  Would definately stay there again   no problem  
N =>  Star at a three star price I cant say enough about how wonderful Intercontinental Hotel in Montreal was for our stay  I booked a double room traveling with my husband Mom and two yorkies  The room was large and the bathroom was very spacious  The furnishings were modern and very comfy  The room was well appointed with all the neccesities  The service was fantastic from the front desk valet parking room service concierge to housekeeping  Everyone was pleasant gracious and very helpful  They even sent a cake for My mother as we were celebrating her birthday  Im not sure how they even knew Would reccomend this hotel a million times  
N => Dont Waste Your Time In This Overly Rated Hotel We received confirmation of a two night stay at in a room with two double beds  Upon arrival we were told that we had a room but it was not one with two double beds  We were told that it is not their policy to hold such a specific request   as per their policy  which we have yet to see in writing  it is their policy to guarantee a room without specifics  How inane is that After much debate at reception the unconcerned clerk said that she will arrange to have a cot brought in for the night and would have us moved into a room with double beds the next day  We went up to the room changed and went out returning at about  am the next morning  Much to our chagrin there was not cot in the room  The night supervisormanager said the cot was not placed in the room because it violated fire regulations   after a long and heated argument with him he offered to do us the quotfavourquot of over riding this so called fire regulations rule and brought the cot up himself to our room  He then had the audacity to state that as a gesture of goodwill he will forgo charging us for the cot  If the windows could have opened in that room I swear that I would have been tempted to push him out of it  The next day we were moved to the correct room    which was now without a blow dryer or an ironing board  Well at this point we were so upset by the laissez faire attitude of the staff that we ided not to complain  For all its write ups on the internet this hotel would be rated as a   star in my book   The rooms were NOT spotless and through the windows one could see  or five spiders outside  I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE  By the way the hotel didnt even offer to refund the difference between for the single room we stayed in the first night and the double we originally paid for    
N => Uneven service not a baby friendly hotel I would first off like to say that I am very disappointed with this hotel  Ive always enjoyed my stays at Intercontinental hotels  We traveled with my  month son so we needed a mini fridge for his milk  I asked about it and the lady at the front desk said that they dont offer a mini fridge option there are minibars in the room but they have sensors so we would be charged every time we moved something  We ided to just order milk through room service  The next day we did so and one glass of milk was  typical room service prices but since we were there for  days we didnt want to spend that much  We ided to check at the front desk again  We asked a young lady what our options are and she said that they could look into emptying out the mini bar for us to use  Another young lady at the front desk chimed in that they cant empty the mini bar but we can get a mini fridge in the room for night  That would be  for the trip the price of buying our own fridge Ive traveled all over the world and have never run into this problem  At any rate there did not seem to be any construction while we were there  The rooms were clean and the concierge was very helpful in finding baby friendly restaurants for us  I just wished they were a little more understanding about the fridge  
N => Couldnt handle the guests We just got back from a five nigths trip to Montreal  The hotel is under construction and the entrance is just not professional and appealing  You have to change elevators to go to your room the hotel restaurant is just dark smells funny and the food is just okay  The staff are nice and helpful but we didnt receive the four star service at all they are definitely short staffed and can not handle the construction  You would think if an Intercontinental Hotel is going through construction they would at least higher more staff or at least really go out of there way to make up for the situation We asked for slippers four times during our stay and we never received it  The concierge was very unprofessional and would only send you to places that he probably gets free meals   the two places that recommended for dinners were just not what he claimedHe didnt care about the quality of the places which he recommended and didnt even listen to what we were looking for  We ended up going to another hotel and tipped the concierge to get good and helpful recommendations for restaurants and interesting areas They give you free breakfast and free drinks coupons to compensate for it but it really doesnt change the experience  We went to Hotel James which is right next to the Intercontinental and checked out the hotel restaurant and the quality of service was just superb  Next time we are in Montreal we would definitely stay at Hotel James  I would not recommend this hotel at this state be when they are done with the construction they would be different but I wouldnt go back again  
N => The underwhelming InterContinental Montreal    a note to my travel consultant   I wasnt going to say anything however I felt I should nevertheless do so  Whilst it was great to have spent a few very cold days in Montreal for the first time over this past weekend  you do need to know for future reference that the Intercontinental Hotel Montreal Quebec Canada was seriously one of the worst hotels weve ever stayed in anywhere  We had serious reservations upfront about staying in anything InterContinental but were happy to overlook them not least of all as it seemed like a good easter weekend deal  They are however in the process of a major reation which is fine to a degree but not when one isnt warned of this upfront and where virtually i e  literally every service within the establishment suffered accordingly   and made a mockery of their weekend special  The above concerns reservations were further confirmed upon entering our newly reated stale smelling straight out of the early seventies oon room   reservations that were re inforced whenever one needed to for example phone any service within the establishment a challenge all of its own and for instance request towels or that old room service crockery be removed etc  as happened incidentally each day  I used to be in the hotel biz many years ago so perhaps I tend to notice small things  The trouble was that our numerous not unjustified complaints ranging from room service to housekeeping to not even having someone to assist us with our luggage upon arrival were rather larger service issues  The noticeable lack of any visible senior management merely exacerbated the above service deficiencies despite the friendly attitude and efforts of the long suffering front house staff working under ridiculous makeshift conditions  Also just for the record its not truly in the old quarter no matter what is claimed to the contrary The above was all put in writing at their request upon our departure if I were you however I would seriously hesitate ever recommending this hotel group to anyone in the future  Needless to say I have never heard a single word from anyone at the hotel opos the unnaceptable level of service received  
N => Wait Until Reation is Over This would have been a beautiful amp awesome hotel ONLY IF it wasnt under reation while we were there  There currently is no lobby amp the hallways are definitely unfinished   However at least the reation of the rooms were complete as our superior room had a very nice bathroom arate shower amp tub amp giant LCD TV Location wise it was close to our  most frequented places Chinatown amp Old Montreal If only we had a come a couple months later when the reations were complete    
N => Stars should be suspended during reations This could possibly be a nice location although being in the business district the shops were closed on the weekends  The hotel is undergoing extensive reations which mean no common space no bar no restaurants  Not even a lobby which was now located in a converted room The room service was late and unresponsive to our concerns tar tar sauce with chicken  There are definately better values in Montreal  
N => Avoid this Hotel Under Construction and Over Priced Stayed for three nights last weekend via priceline name your own price     star  Hotel is still under construction  Waited in a line on a late friday afternoon to check in for  minutes  One receptionist on duty  Staff all were very pleasant and room was fine Not the kicker ordered room service on saturday without checking menu and prices  Ordered OJ coffee and oatmeal and the bill was  I am not kidding  Staff said cest la vie Quality was just OK not even water came with the order  Clearly this property is not close to being a  star   avoid avoid avoid 
N => Worse Experience of my Life experience I have ever had  Lets begin with the fact that I made the reservation at the same time as my brother and he got a rate   cheaper then I did for a smaller room then mine  When I asked for a match they refused  That was fine  I was willing to pay what was quoted  When I got there at pm for check in my room was not ready and I was told I would have to wait at least an hour  Around pm my room was ready  I walk into my room only to find out that it also belonged to someone else  Imagine my embarrassment walking into someone elses room Luckily no one was there  When I returned to the front desk I asked to speak to the Hotel Manager to complain  The manager offered me an upgrade of my room for the mishap however when I got my new room it was the exact same room with a worse view When I called to complain about that the manager yelled at me told me there was nothing he can do for me oh he did offer me complimentary breakfast the next morning  Woo Hoo and that I needed to understand that they were full  When I asked him how many stars did the Hotel have his response was we strive to be a  star  I dont think that they will accomplish that with such poor leadership in place  I called the corporate offices to make a formal complaint and then the Manager called me back to yell at me some more for being inconsiderate and ungrateful for the offer of a complimentary breakfast I finally got him to reduce my rate I still paid more then my brother did however the problems persisted  My showerhead was broken the bathroom wallpaper was falling off and the iron did not work  I will say the housekeeping and concierge staff were very helpful and kind however the overall experience was horrendous  I will never stay at another Intercontinental or any other Hotel in their chain 
N => Excellent value for money My wife and I and our infant son stayed at the Montreal Intercontinental for one night on  th  We found our stay to be very comfortable as well as a very good price for the amenities of the hotel  We bid  on Priceline and our bid was accepted  While I wouldnt say that the Intercontinental is a quottruequot four star due to the slightly dated rooms and uneven service by the front desk it was certainly a bargain compared to   hotels near the airport that were priced on expedia at twice that rate We had flown in from London and were just spending the night on the way to Vermont the following day  The Intercontinental was very simple to find and a very easy spot from which to leave the city the following day Upon arrival we were greeted immediately by a doorman who saw to our luggage and parked the car although at  for parking it was a bit expensive  We were checked in promptly enough it was  pm by a trainee front desk person who was a bit uncertain about how to issue us keys but there were no delays  At the front desk we requested a portable crib no extra cost for our son and it was delivered within five minutes of getting to our room The room itself was plenty spacious with a ent view of the old town  The beds were comfortable and there was ample storage for our bags and clothing  The bathroom was large with a shower and a arate bathtub  Shampoos and soaps by Elemis were a nice touch as well  The bed coverings curtains and rugs could have used updating but they were all clean and well looked after  There was also a coffee maker with one free pot of coffee Having come in from London and being pretty tired we ordered room service  Even on a night when the hotel appeared to be empty we could not reach room service directly  The hotel operator took our message and room service returned our call in  minutes  Delivery was approximately  minutes later  The food was only adequate nothing remotely special and for the prices  for a very small pizza was not worth it Check out was easy the next day and they did give me Admirals club credit even though I had booked through Priceline which was a bonus In sum aside from the expensive and uninteresting room service menu the hotel more than met our expectations in terms of delivering good value for the money  
N => Great Stay and Experience Had a great stay on Christmas  Doorman to reception to breakfast service was impecable  Rooms were spotless bathrooms are huge      nothing to complain about  Would highly recommend this property LOcation is perfect for touring Old Montreal and downtown Montreal  Very comfortable beds      was with wife and kids and all were made to feel welcome  
N => Nothing Special Disappointed We looked forward to this hotel even after the bad reviews  As an Ambassador I am guaranteed a room upgrade upon checkin and we were given a suite  Entering the suite we almost needed a gas mask as the room reeked of smoke we had specified a month ago for a non smoking room  The front desk then pushed us back into our original club room that we had booked with no explanation for an upgrade the next day perhaps The club lounge was closed on Saturday we arrived friday night  Upon asking front desk they advised that since someone called in sick they had to close the lounge  That is a manegement issue right here  We were then allowed to have breakfast in the restaurant No greetings by the doormen or front desk each time you entered or exited the hote  Overall not a pleasant stay  I would highly recommend the Fairmont Hotel in Montreal  An excellent location right above the VIA rail train station and close to everything downtown  
N => very bad service  we didnt get what we requested we were nickel and dimed by the hotel for an extra  the room was small and uncomfortable manager was nasty to us overall bad service long check in lines etcon the plus side it is in a good location and we had plenty of towels I stayed at this hotel for two nights in    We got a great deal on priceline for US dollars a night  We had requested a room with two beds because my friend and I cannot sleep in the same bed for reasons I wont mention in this review  When we checked in we were informed that the only available rooms had king size beds with only  bed per room and that if we wanted an extra cot to be brought to the room it would be  dollars per night  We were ok with having a cot brought in  I mean its a good compromise but we were NOT ok with being charged an additional  per night or with the nasty attitude the manager had  He repeated  or  times in the conversation that there was nothing he could do about the extra charge because we booked on priceline  It just reinfored the double standard they use for treating guests who have discounted room rates versus guests who pay full price  I would certainly never return to this hotel  Dina K New York NY 
N => Beautiful Hotel but felt  nickeled and dimed  I came to Montreal for business and was impressed right away with the location and the room I was given  The room was clean well laid out with lots of space and a very large bathroom  I was in a corner room and had fantastic views I travel extensively with my job and this hotel did not cater to people who require business access  Internet was an additional   a day which I did not know before I had booked this hotel and I was not able to get logged in successfully  I found room service to be quite overpriced and not a good value either Because of the feeling that this hotel was overpriced for what I required I called the travel agent to move me to another hotel  When I checked out I was charged a  early check out fee which is ironic since the reason I was leaving is the feeling of being quotnickeled and dimedquot If I was here on vacation I probably would have stayed    however as a business traveller the other hotel that I was moved to was similarily priced however provided much more of what I required internet included breakfast included and even a bottle of water each night 
N => Nice Hotel wa Convenient Location This was our first trip to Montreal and was planned to celebrate our anniversary  As loyalty program members we called the hotel in advance to request an upgrade and to make some dinner reservations  We only received the standard Ambassadors Club upgrade to a club room but it was well located w a view of the St  Lawrence  The room was large with a king bed chair bench and large armoire wTV  There was a safe in one of the nightstands  The closet was large wplenty of hangers  The large bath had a arate shower and large vanity and adjacent shelf so there was plenty of room for our toiletries  Towels and linens were high quality  The hotel also provides all kinds of bath products including Qtips razor toothbrush and paste etc  We found this hotel to be very conveniently located win walking distance to Vieux Montreal  There was also a Metro station in the building  The lobby was attractive and the staff all helpful and friendly providing directions and hints  We were given a confirmation packet wour dinner reservations upon check in  Adjacent to the hotel was a small shopping area with a coffee shop store for snacks water etc and some fast food places  We chose to self park and the garage below the hotel was  per day  Overall a great place to stay and convenient to many of the sites of Montreal  
N => Great Hotel Great Service Great Room We got this room through Priceline for   It was an amazing room on the rd floor with a view of the Notre Dame Cathedral Port and Champlain Bridge  Service was great from check in to room service to check out and the bellvalet  It was a very pleasant stay and I would DEFINATELY stay here again and even be willing to pay full price   
N => Great Price for Excellent Hotel y   I booked this hotel through priceline com and was pleasantly surprised by the US rate that was accepted by this hotel  I had not stayed here before and given my experience I would both recommend it and return on a future visit  It is conveniently located close to Old Montreal  We walked to Notre Dame and the waterfront  My Wife and I went with two friends for the Just for Lhs Festival and this was an ideal place for us to be  The rooms were spacious clean with enormous bathrooms with both a tub and arate enclosed shower  All the amenities were provided and the bed was very comfortable  Linens and pillows were better than average  The only small quip would be the small tv however we were not in Montreal to watch tv in our room  We had a very helpful concierge Valery who recommended a very good bistro not far away for dinner Holder which we enjoyed  Having read reviews previously I parked across the street rather than at the hotel  Not sure if it saved any money at  a night there as opposed to the hotel  We walked to the very good Eggs spectations for breakfast just two blocks away  Our friends had one bad experience of their room being left alone by housekeeping until the late afternoon when we had returned from walking around and they were stuck without being able to relax  That was a disappointment but not for our room  Housekeeping staff should complete their task long before check in time around PM you would think  Otherwise a hotel that I recommend  Enjoy your travels to Montreal 
N => No customer service I totally agree with the former reviewer that the Intercontinental staff are rude and aloof  They have no concept of customer service  Last time we stayed there we had numerous errors on our bill and only returned because of the good access to old Montreal  After one night we ided to switch to the Sofitel where the staff were delightful 
N => Good Location weak customer service I spend a lot of time in Montreal on business for stay of a few nights to over  weeks  Ive logged time at many different Montreal hotels and the Intercontinental is a solid choice for business travelers  The rooms are a ent size as are the baths but like a number of Montreal hotels staff is the weak spot  I didnt find them rude so much as indifferent  No cheerful offers of help  No professional attitude  Just sort of Its a job and Ill do it if I have to  And they are very short on bell staff so be prepared to manage your own bags  Youll need to go up an escalator to the lobby and reception desk as the hotel occupies the top floors of an office building I took a large corner room and when the first didnt suit the front desk willingly changed my room  Room service was exceptionally expensive but good and arrived hot and the bar and restaurant both had good food far better than the usual hotel fare in Montreal  Dinner in the main restaurant was around pp with one glass of wine  Breakfast was good but service then was rather haphazard  Bar service was prompt and the drinks good  The limited lunch menu was good and food hot and served promptly  Phone calls using a pre paid calling card still resulted in a charge  What is it with hotels and all these stupid little add on charges Its a very annoying trend The bed slept hot  The work desk was uncomfortable but with wi fi I was able to work on the loveseat  The TV was not the quot indicated but a little quot model at least  years old Bathroom was large but the shower stall really tiny  It had a arate heating system  The room thermostat was more orative than useful  The location is really good in summer months when getting into Old Montreal would be easy but I was there when a snow storm hit and walking around was a pain  The hotel does sit on a subway stop but I took a taxi up to St Cathrines to wander the main shopping area   each way  The mall adjacent to the hotel operates during business hours Monday to Friday except for a large clothing store everything was closed by PM  Theres no place to buy soda or water or any little stuff you  have forgotten once the little drug store closes as the Intercontinental has no gift shop like most hotels Not Montreals best but a solid entry with good rooms well done for business travelers looking for a   level hotel  Better than the Sheraton or riott Chateau Champlain  riott has better service but small rooms   Weekend visitors   maid service on weekends is LATE  looked to be about half staff  in the day so be prepared  
N => Service could have been much better The hotel is nice looking but upon arrival the bell service did not offer to take our bags and we were told our room would not be ready for   hours  We were then told we could carry our bags down to the bell service station to check them until we were able to check in  When we went back to chek in the desk was very understaffed as it was every day we were there and they apparently lost our papers for the room we checked in to earlier  This second process took us about  minutes  When we got to our room it was an average looking room  The best thing was the location  Staying in Old Montreal is perfect  
N => Very nice hotel I stayed at the Intercontinental Montreal from  th   th   This was my first trip to Montreal I was in town for a convention which took place at the convention centre across the street Palais des Congres de Montreal I thought this hotel was very nice  Perhaps a bit pretentious but you tend to get that with a high end hotel  The staff were extremely friendly the restaurant was quite good my room was very nice my bed was incredible   I slept very well during my stay  The piano barlounge in the hotel was also quite good  Be sure to try an appletini   it was deliciousDefinitely check out Old Montreal especially the Notre Dame Basilica  It really is incredible I found Montrealers to be very friendly  I had been concerned that Id have some difficulties in Montreal as I dont speak French but thankfully everyone that I met was very gracious and switched to English as soon as they realized I was struggling to understand Being in Montreal truly has a unique feel to it   very unlike the rest of Canada  Montreal is a great place to visit if you want to feel as if youve left Canada without having to travel very far If attending a convention at the Palais des Congres de Montreal the location of the Intercontinental is perfect The hotel is beautiful and I would highly recommend staying there  
N => Priceline entitles you to be treated as a second class guest When asking for a form about the use of my personal information that was supposed to be available under request to any guest the manager made himself very clear that I was a Priceline customer and treated me as a second class guest  The form was not only unavailable for us but I was told that I was Priceline customer so if I did not agree to sign the release form of my personal information I could not stay in the hotel The room was supposed to be ready by  pm  When we arrived after  pm to pickup the room key the room was not ready  A person from the staff was supposed to verify the minibar  The room was very spacious and the bed looked very comfortable  However the sink had hair showing that the bathroom was not clean properly  
N => Great hotel  Will definitely stay there again  After reading previous negative reviews we were very apprehensive and thought we made a mistake on our non refundable reservations  We were wrong  We had an excellent experience at this hotel  We arrived early for check in before noon  Although our room was not ready the desk clerk voluntarily without our asking upgraded us to the next higher level room at no additional charge and checked us in immediately  It was a large corner room good view of the city and a beautiful large bathroom complete with arate shower stall and tub  Beautiful clean room well appointed  The staff was very courteous throughout our stay  The concierge was pleasant and helpful  Our last night we ate in the hotels formal dining room  Excellent french meal excellent service and very postive friendly staff  We definitely recommend the dining room  It was pricy but that is the case in all major downtown cities  Very convenient location to the metro and Old Montreal  Gray Line tours picks you up at the hotel  On checkout our bill was completely accurate for the tours and meals we had billed to our room  Checkout was quick accurate and friendly  We will definitely stay here again  P S  Take a tour to Quebec City  It is worth the trip 
N => Awful Hotel My advice  dont stay here I have stayed in nicer quotcheap motelsquot than this alleged five star hotel The only reason I stayed after the first night was that it was a non refundable pre paid stay The hotel was not very clean the service rude the prices outrageous  The bed broke during my stay  Worst of all they screwed up my bill royally I had checked out and had paid my outrageous OTHER charges in full Another   PLUS on top of my already pre paid room charges  I returned home and fraud alert from my credit card company called noticing something was amiss  I had NEVER authorized them to bill any expenses on this card they were charges that had already been paid on another card but they broke this billing up up into  bits to put them through under the radar screen of my credit co  and it messed up my banking for several days  They kept adding charges on this card even AFTER I had checked out and paid ALL monies owed I could not have this fixed by the hotel immediately as it was a weekend  so the front desk person very unsymapthetically told me there would be no one in until Monday to help with this  Had to wait till Monday to speak with someone at the hotel who resolved the problem the next day  Awful hotel awful experience Wild horses could not drag me to stay in this hotel again  Be warned 
N => Great stay at the Intercon       Contrary to some of the other reviews here I had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Intercon  I was a bit apprehensive after having read the other reviews but upon my arrival I was informed that I had been upgraded to a corner suite for the whole of my stay complete with a complimentary basket of fruit which put my mind at rest  I have no complaints at all the room was extremely comfortable and above all clean as was the ensuite ble bathroom and I had great views of the old port  Everything I needed was already provided ie iron and ironing board or extra towels in which some hotels I have had to request  Housekeeping were good and did not disturb me when I wanted to be left alone to sleep and just left discrete messages as to when I wanted the room cleaned  Room service was also very good though a little on the pricey side  The hotel was also very close to Old Montreal and just opposite the Palais de Congress where I was attending my conference  I also found it completely safe to walk around there and back from the downtownshopping area no matter what time of nightday it was  All in all I had a lovely stay at the Intercontinental in Montreal  
N => For it to be an Inter Continental I was universally dissappointed It has been some time since I stayed at the IC  However in reading the reviews I was reminded of my experience at the hotel and felt obligated to share  We stayed for a week at this hotel probably in  for my birthday during the last week of   thats when we always go to Montreal  I was dissappointed from the very beginning  First the hotel did not give me the feel of a Grand destination Hotel like I was looking for  As I recall you arrive at a portal and then have to go up on an elevator or escalator to the main lobby  After arriving at check in the same rude attendants were there as other people have mentioned  I am a frequent business traveller and know my way around the various traveller programs  Well these people would not cooperate for any upgrades under any circumstances  not even what I was promised when making my reservation  They were even rude about it  When we arrived to our room there was a big problem  I think we reserved a suite but it turned out to be something else like a very dark room that never got direct sunlight  The front desk did not cooperate at all so I had to invoke the General Mgr and threaten to check out of the hotel all together before they agreed to move us to another room  They finally did  I remember the Restaurant to be small and unimpressive  the food about the same  I did enjoy the cocktail lounge  I liked the way they served the alcohol in a arate container from the mixer  All things considered I would not stay at this hotel again  I was very displeased  
N => Intercontinental a local  
N => Intercontinental great propery bad service  
N => Stole my house keys This hotel now has my house keys and refuses to return them to me  I phoned numerous times and spoke to the Manager Jay Raaz and he told me he would send them and still no keys  I have no idea why they have an interest in keeping my house keys but DO NOT STAY HERE  
N => Putrid     horrible      beware First time in my life and Im no youngster that I checked out of a hotel shortly after checking in without even staying the night  You want specific complaints Lets start when you drive from the office to your room     the road has more holes in it than swiss cheese  You get to the building where your room is     a low squat cement structure that looks like one of those buildings in Sarajevo or other war torn regions with crumbling cement falling off the outside walls and cracks throughout as though shell shocked much as I felt looking at all this  Ahhh but the real splendor lies in the room      a cement box unadorned two beds with headboards missing rails stained carpets stained everything dirty grout at least one can only HOPE it was dirt could have been mold didnt want to get close enough to tell throughout the shower walls the general stench that permeated the place     Im giving this place a huge UGGHHH no stars stay away  We checked right out was worth losing a nights rate as we got a ent room in a much better part of town  Oh yeah the neighborhood leaves a lot to be desired as well but no need to even get to that when you consider everything unpleasant about the place itself  
N => PERFECT for those seeking the bare neccessities  Depending on the traveler this hotel can be a great value or a great disappointment  For my wife and I it was an excellent value amp exceeded our expectations  We are not wealthy travelers who are accustom to luxury however we have more needs than the average college student  back packer hotel guest  We are somewhere in between those extremes and so is this hotel  Its not too expensive not too fancy but has more than enough comfort and convenience and everything you need including spacious rooms helpful staff cleanliness parking costs extra but worth it free internet access breakfast convenient location to public transportation and restaurants     As well as air conditioning great water pressure and quick elevators  I dont have a single complaint  Worth every penny 
N => great place to stay           i was relocated from my home due to water damage and i stayed at this hotel for  days our stay was great  i stayed in the  bedroom suite on the  floor and the views were amazing the staff was very friendly and polite  the hotel was extremely clean after researching many hotels there rates were pretty reasonable on  occasions my stay had to be extended and the hotel staff was very accommodating i would definitely recommended this hotel i would have to say my stay was excellent  
N => You could do better for the money  terrible service My husband and I have stayed here before with much success  The hotel has really gone down overall in service and cleanliness  We were quite dissapointed We stayed in a suite  It was very warm  They had an old ineffecient ac only in the living area  The bedroom was too hot to sleep  The fan was broken on high speed and the window would not open  We asked for them to fix it until we went down again hours later and a different man was there  The room was generally old and musty  No one is there to help you with your bags  The women at the front desk couldnt understand my reservation and there was mixup as to a prior cancellation Also I became quite ill in the hallway near my room and my key did not work  The maid refused to let me in my room  The sent another women up who was quite rude and refused to let me in my room also  After  minutes they sent the manager up after a great deal of panic and begging to let me in  I finally became sick all over myself in the hallway  Even after that incident the manager insisted he see an ID  After the humilation and begging they let me in  My husband finally came out of the room and sternly let the office now our displeasure  We immediately left the hotel and will never return  I dont think I have ever been treated that poorly in any service environment  Considering a low to medicore interior and awful service environment it just not worth saving an extra   dollars when there are lovely hotels close by  
N => Good place to stay  This is a very reasonably priced hotel on Sherbrooke St  Sainte Catherine Street was an easy walk away as well as Crescent Street  We enjoyed being able to cook our own meals and have a bedroom arate from the living space  Room was a good size for the two of us  Pros   Free internet can borrow an Ethernet cable from the front desk   Full kitchen in your room to prepare meals  Free contentinental breakfast   balconyCons   parking garage was unavailabe so we had to park at another hotel across the street temporary problem   we were on the second floor  and it was quite noisy   request a higer floor if possible Overall we would stay here again  
N => Great Hotel We just came back from a week long vacation in Montreal  The overall experience was just great The food jazz festival weather etc  could not be any better  Same goes for the hotel  Check in took not more then  minutes plus they have upgrated us from Br to Br with no extra charge We didnt even have to ask We had a large vehicle so our parking was across the street  At all times we felt very safe and comfortable  Breakfast was pretty ent and if you didnt want to eat in the breakfast room on the st floor you could take it to your room with no questions asked  Our kids used the pool every day of our stay there  Pool was very clean water warm and always plenty of towels available  I would definitely stay there again 
N => adequate adequate rooms nothing special  for the price you can probably get something closer to the old port  Staff very helpful breakfast was ent  Would probably stay closer to old port next time  
N => Excellent accomodation Very nice comfortable appartment kitchen microwave stove table fridgefreezer lounge amp arate bedroom  Laundry facilities available  Close to centre of downtown and McGill Metro station  Free internet available in breakfast room   no Wifi  Continetal breakfast included in rate coffee juice muffins cereal etc  Good value  Would recommend this as a perfect place to stay in Montreal  
N => A bit disappointed After reading all the positive reviews about this hotel I was a bit disappointed when we experienced it first hand  The room was okay nothing special  Not huge just average  Carpet had pulls and appeared to need a cleaning  Kitchendining area tile floor was very dirty I had to clean it as soon as we checked into our room as we have a toddler that would be roaming around on hands and knees  Bathroom was fine bedroom okay too  Very hard to navigate hotel with stroller though  No ramps or handicap areas  Only stairs to front door and tiny hallways in back of hotel  Walls were paper thin  We heard every conversation in the rooms around us above us and in the hallway The fire alarm went off in the building at  am and everyone crowded into staircase to get out of building  We were on the th floor so it was quite a ways down  The problem was that after the fire department lared the building okay to enter again the elevators would not work  So after almost  hours of waiting downstairs we had to lug ourselves and baby up  flights of stairs  Management never offered any explanation never apologized and never made any announcement as to what was going on during this frightening experience  In fact they told my husband that it was not the hotels fault that this kind of thing happens frequently  We were very disappointed with attitude of staff and management  Most likely would not stay here again  
N => Exceeded Expectations I was afraid of this hotel because it is not a chain and with a chain you know what youre getting    plus we got a discounted rate but it was great We stayed in a studio room with our five month old son and there was lots of room  The room was very very clean the appliances in the kitchen were brand new  We didnt cook but it was nice to store any fooddrinks in the fridge and we used the glasses  We were told there would be a crib set up for us turns out they brought us a playpen which we had to set up but it was totally easy and no charge so it was OK  The laundry room was great we had a sauna which was nice also  The rooftop patio was nice overlooking the whole city but you have to go through the pool room to get there and there were stairs  Also there are only stairs to get into the hotel itself  All in all though the perfect spot for us great location we walked EVERYWHERE except the mountain 
N => Anyone like Cockroaches   me neither so dont stay here After reading the great reviews my boyfriend and I ided to stay here    what a huge mistake  The hotel room itself is big if you choose the one bedroom suite  However it looks like a flashback from the s All in all we still ided to stay   UNTIL WE SAW A COCKROACH And you know once there is one there are many We went to reception to see what they could do but they only had a studio room available and moved us to the th floor  This was not to our liking as there was only a double bed and not a queen which we paid for  They did not discount our room at all but just gave us the rate for the studio  The continental breakfast was alright but I was too afraid to eat anything knowing there were cockroaches roaming around  I dont even think they sprayed the room at all bc they put people in there right after we left  ewwww I would not reccomend this hotel at all bc for  night I didnt pay to sleep with bugs 
N => Our new favourite hotel  
N => Great place to stay  
N => This Place Rules  
N => A good choice  
N => Disappointing servce We just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Place dArmes  Based on previous reviews here we were expecting a nice experience   we were sadly disappointed  Each day we returned to our hotel room in the late afternoon pm and pm to find that our room had not been cleaned  Minor issues but surprising for this type of hotel we received turn down service only one of the three nights we received the morning paper only one of the three mornings staff made little attempt to say hello or smile  
N => Small hotel big on service We stayed for three nights in y  we paid   CD and we were not disappointed The staff is extremely helpful and willing to please even when busy  They make you feel like they have been waiting just for you to arrive  The room was divine and in our opinion not at all small although it was a little cramped with a rollaway bed  The room was immaculate and furnished simply and luxuriously  When our valet opened the door to our room we were greated with classical music playing on the radio  After the long drive partly in the rain this room and this hotel was wonderfully refreshingWe were not disappointed in the evening wine and cheese  One of our party didnt drink so instead of wine enjoyed a soda with the abundant bread and varied cheeses  Two wines were offered for the complimentary glass a red and a white  The breakfast was outstanding with delicious breads and pastries cereal yogurt fruit juices coffee teas and cheeses I only have a few small complaints we had to call three times to get our rollaway bed and it was not a good bed even for a rollaway  However I slept on it and was comfortable enough  Local phone calls are   each which I think is kind of chintzy and valet parking was   a day  The charge for parking was not made clear on the website and I wouldnt have even known about it if I had not read another review on this site  However this is a city hotel and even if they had parking on site you wouldnt really expect it to be free Other than these small complaints I cant say enough good things about this hotel and if I return to Montr al most likely I would stay here  
N => A wonderful hotel We enjoyed a four night stay in a deluxe king room  The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean  The restaurant Aix downstairs has great creative cuisine  The staff went out of their way to give good restaurant recommendations and offbeat places to see in Montreal  They were always very helpful and made you feel very welcome at the hotel  I will stay here again on my next trip to Montreal  
N => Pefect Hotel to end a great trip Hotel Place dArmes was our treat at the end of our Canadian honeymoon and believe me after staying in the Holiday Inn in Niagara and a little cutesy Auberge in Quebec this was sheer luxury From the first minute we arrived the staff were very friendly and accommodating   they even offered to leave our rental car back for us when we joked about not being able to face the traffic  The hotel is centrally located and easily accesible The or in the bedroom was just lovely and very soothing  Little touches is what this hotel are great at each room has a CDstero playing classical music when you arrive into your room ice and chocolates are delivered each evening comfy bath robes good toiletries and lovely to come back to after a long day shopping and sight seeing      a wine and cheese reception  The hotel clientelle are quite businessy and we stuck out a little in our casuals but it really didnt matter The only negative thing would be when something happened with our air conditioning in the bathroom and we ended up with a large enough pool of water from the leak  We told reception about it and they were very laid back about doing anything about it and when we vacated the room for a few hours so they could look into the leak we came back to find nothing had been done  The next day it got worse but we were due to check out so they said theyd check it out when we left  
N => Highly recommend Hotel Place d Armes My wife and I stayed at Hotel Place d Armes on ober    and absolutely loved it  My wife is very picky about hotels but she didnt have one complaint The rooms were spacious the bed was extremely comfortable it was hard to get out of bed every day the bathrooms had great accessories  The wine amp cheese was a great perk as was the breakfast all included  The price was right amp the location was unbeatable  The Metro station was only  block away and everything to see was in walking distance  We highly recommend Hotel Place d Armes The gym had great Life Fitness equipment too 
N => Hotel Place dArmes Highlighed my trip to Montreal This was my first visit to a boutique hotel and a great success  The room or soothing and sophisticated with a desk I could work on  The wine bar at  oclock was the ultimate perk  Would I go back Absolutely 
N => Okay Stay    I had stayed at the Hotel Nelligan last summer which was fantastic and looked forward to trying a new sister hotel  The hotel itself is nice enough however there is no bar service in the lobby after cocktail hour and you have to go downstairs to order a drink from the restaurant  The restaurant and front desk do not appear to have any relationship and even when the waiter refused to appear with our change the front desk did not assist in rectifying the matter  The rooms are not as big as the rooms at the Hotel Nelligan and over all I did not like this hotel as much  For the price I would expect more  
N => Great hotel   great location Loved the hotel even if they lost our reservation  They were able to accomodate us  I only give it above average because our room was on the street side  I wore ear plugs to sleep  Otherwise everything was excellent  Id stay here again the location couldnt have been better  Right in the heart of Old Montreal and a block from the Metro  
N => HOrrible service they are careless after money only Ive had it I didnt wanna do this but they have RIPPED ME OFF and given me the RUN AROUND finally OVERCHARGING ME and Ive had enough crap so here I go with my negative review of these CARELESS peopleMy girlfriend and I visited the Hotel Place DArmes for the  Valentines weekend    the quotRomantic Packagequot which was  including  hour massage double jacuzzi delux room wine  cheese each afternoon a small bottle of champaigne and dinner at the in house restaurant A I X Breakdown      I like being told upfront about things I am gonna be billed for or charged  I dont like people beating around the bush to make an extra buck    Im sure most of us who work hard for our money feel the same way  There is no place to park except valet which came to night which we werent told till we were leaving    but thats just getting started       I remember booking the room asking for a large high deluxe double jacuzzi room the guy I spoke to assured me I would get a superb room  Well we got a SMALL as revealed to us by our masseuse later on corner room and the so called quotdouble jacuzziquot was quite small inside the small washroom more like a single  To make things worse the drain plug would not work    it was broken and wouldnt come out until I pried it out with my nails  I didnt call the hotel staff for help as we were both INSIDE the tub at the time and it was am so I had no choice       The massage girl seemed tired but I wont pick on her  She freaked out at how small our corner room was which added to my suspicion that we got jipped  There was NO ROOM for her massage bed to open unless we moved the furniture into the corner      Although we were booked for pm at the restaurant they had to look for a seat when we got there on time mind you    we were seated at a small square table at the side of the restaurant between two other tables  inches apart    absolutely no privacy  After we were seated there were  other couples that came in after us that got served before us  Our  course meal turned out to be  course as the waitress forgot to bring out our chocolate covered strawberries    until we finally asked what happenned to it at the end  We understood drinks were extra so this was not a problem until at the end we were given a bill for the ENTIRE MEAL  We told the waitress about our package price and after another  minutes she brought out a bill just for the drinks     so we paid that in cash plus a generous tip       These people like to LOOK GOOD and dont really care about your comfort or quality of your stay  While driving home I noticed they CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD for the drinks which I had already PAID for plus gratuity and taxes      I had to drive back and ask them to fix it but I was told that they have no access to the restaurant receipts at the time that theyd correct the mistake later that night and call me to let me know       THREE days later I get a voicemail message from Daniella asking to call her back the next morning so she could quotexplainquot what the extra charges were       I call back the next morning and was told quotshes not working todayquot and was forwarded to someone else  The person had the GALL and AUDACITY to ask me quotDid you take the slippers from the roomquot      WE DIDNT GET ANY         SLIPPERS IN THE ROOM    WERE WE SUPPOSED TO      Long story short they ended up reimbursing  flat to my credit card    even though the bill was change plus gratuity plus taxes the total taxes for the bill came to more than  so that was affected by the additional charges       Does this sound like a hotel where they care about your well being do they want you to come back Do they want you to feel good about your stay your expenditures to make sure it was worth while NO       They need to get their act together and communicate to their staff more  They need to stop being p     about small charges and lastly when THEY MESS UP and overcharge someone they need to NOT ACCUSE the person they are overcharging of STEALING       We will NEVER stay at such a GARBAGE hotel again  DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL THEY ARE RUTHLESS AND ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY  
N => Five Star Staff Indifference  
N => A great place to stay  
N => our very favorite hotel anywhere  
N => total luxury  
N => Excellente fin de semain au Place dArmes  
N => Super tolles Luxus Hotel ganz in der Naehe der Altstadt  
N => Fantastic little Hotel Albert gave me the room  located in the second floor at the back and it was was soo quietthe only thing i didnt have in the description from the website was a fridge   so he made someone bring me some ice and bottle of water The hotel room was very very nice My girlfriend loved it so muchshe liked it a lotthe Tv in that room was placed awkwardly wasnt able to move it  but o well I didnt really watch TV  I was hooked on the internet with my laptop  the internet speed was very fast  the showers water strength was very strong like the other peoples reviewEverything was set with a lot of details Bravo againI had a late check out with no extra charge I check in by h but i had to go back to work so after work  we got into our room by h and we left at  the next day ps Albert offered us free breakfast  if ever I wanted to do another escape hotel lyonnais will be one of the place i will certainly go tobe next time I will take the Suite  
N => A Gem in Montreal Visited Montreal for a few days after a criuse from and into Boston  Travelled up to Montreal and stayed at The Relais Lyonnais after reading tripadvisor reviews and must say was not disappointed  I was somewhat concerned about the size of the hotel as we normally stay in much larger ones but how wrong can you be  We arrived early around   am and Albert who incidentally is fantastic told us our room would be ready shortly so we had an early lunch in the bistro downstairs part of the hotel  The food was terrific and plentiful  A short time later Albert came down to tell us our room was ready and he had taken our bags up for us  The room a suite was excellent and we could not fault it at all Would not hesitate to go back again and fully intend to do so and we would recommend this hotel to anyone Albert you run a fine establishment 
N => Superb weekend getaway When we booked our trip we used the Trip Advisors   rating as our guide and we were very pleased with this gem of a hotel  We did not know it was the Just for Lhs festival and when our taxi cab pulled up we were surprised to find out the street in front of the hotel was blocked off and a lively street party was just getting started  We were initially nervous because it was so loud down on the street and we were assigned a suite on the third floor which was facing the street  We are fairly quiet people who tend to go to bed on the early side but we thought quotwell find out soon enoughquot and got settled in our room  The room was super clean and welcoming  The or was appealing and it had plenty of space with a sitting room large bathroom very comfortable bed and shutters on the windowsdoor  The shower was to die for with great water pressure and duel shower heads  There was an espresso machine and refrigerator in the room  I thought the AC was very easy to use and we were able to set the temperature to exactly what made us comfortable  We had a small balcony where we could watch the parade from the comfort of our prime viewing spot  You could tell the hotel put a lot of thought into their sound proofing of the room  It was extremely loud while you were on the street or even sitting on the balcony but once the doors were closed the noise was quite muffled  Also we were amazed that the street cleared out and was unbelievably quiet no later than midnight  It seemed so civilized for such bedlam up until the silenceWhat we particular liked was the privacy  Albert was very helpful and available if you needed him but no one intruded on us and it felt like at times we had the hotel to ourselves even though I do believe the hotel was full on the weekend we stayed  It was very quiet in the hotel itself and we did not hear our neighbors  We also liked the free and substantial breakfast served downstairs each morning  Finally there was a computer and printer in the common area on the third floor which made printing out our airline tickets a snap  The only con would be for individuals with mobility issues  The hotel has three floors with a narrow staircase and no elevator We felt like the   rating was more than well deserved by this small gem of a hotel and we look forward to staying at the Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais again in the future  
N => Enhanced the entire Montreal experience My hotel experience plays an equal part in the enjoyment of the entire vacation  LRL did its part to represent  Entrance to the Metro was half a block away  All but one metro line intersects the UQAM stop  Our breakfast was complimentary and ridiculously good  Just having a reliable place for a meal or a drink downstairs is a huge plus  The ambiance of the room was modern cozy  AC wremote worked well  TV could have been larger  The toilet was on the far side of the bathroom wall so you had the length of the shower as a noise buffer  Free bottles of water in the good sized fridge  Complimentary chocolates tasted funky  Magazines in the room and in the hallway were a welcome touch  The mattress gave us the best sleep ever  We faced the front and yes we could hear some of the liveliness but it was muted  Even if it did wake you that mattress would lull you right back to sleep  I heard footsteps a couple of times from upstairs but nothing from the guests on the same floor  We rarely saw anyone at the front desk but Albert was around when we needed him   check in and out  Only saw  other guest during our  days so you start to think that you have the place to yourself 
N => So glad we found this hotel We were so thankful to all the truthful reviews  Without repeating I would just like to add that we found this hotel to be a real gem  Our room  have been a little small but our shower stall was the largest I have ever been in  We have stayed in hotels where the entire bathroom wasnt as big as this shower  LOLWe agree that Albert was very helpful and the restaurant for breakfast was very good offering many varieties of omlettes  We liked being if such a lively neighborhood The parking facility was close enough and affordable  
N => Nice little place if you can ignore the grumpyness   STARS  on tripadvisor is defined as  OK but some problems  so I am giving a generous   I write this review with a heavy heart as this place is fundamentally nice and perhaps my review will help fix the problems First you have to ring the buzzer to enter the hotel as there was no one around so for a few minutes I was standing outside buzzing to no avail  An unsmiling man probably the grey haired chap mentioned in other reviews not Albert opened up  I entered a tiny but clean lobby think vestibule of narrow townhouse  I checked in only to find that my confirmed booking from  months before had been shortened from  nights to   I suspect they had bumped me out to accommodate another reservation  The grey haired man called someone to find out what was happening and proceeded to scream down the telephone with what I can only describe as visceral anger  Not boisterous shouting but scary shouting  This shouting lasted for some time and was not only extremely rude but can t be doing that man s blood pressure any good  Basil Fawlty rating  They ided to move me to a different hotel for the last night and although not delighted I agreed  I was then charged up front for the entirety of my stay  I was already feeling concerned so when I meekly questioned if I could pay at the end again a barrage of surliness My allocated room Room  ground floor facing the street was next to reception which felt a little odd  The room was small but accurately represented on the website and the quality of the fixtures and fittings was fine again spotlessly clean  There was coffee but no tea bed linen nice  My main problem however was it was right next to the street  As such it was noisy from traffic and the garageglerock music from nearby establishments it was mid afternoon  This coupled with my bad experience at reception and the fact that they did not honour my reservation made me ide to pay for the night and check out  I gave  hours notice rather than the requisite  so again got a stout telling off Grey haired man did try and charge the extra night but after calling someone they kindly let me go If this had been a more expensive place they would have been given a  star  Messing up a reservation is inexcusable whatever the establishment  However I do feel a bit sorry for the man he seemed so world weary and if I were on holiday rather than business I might have been a bit more relaxed about the noise and position of the room In summation if you go expecting the terrible rudeness and if there are no booking  hiccups  the pricequality ratio is high and you will have a great stay  
N => Great hotel great vacation We stayed here during the first week of y and had a wonderful time  The location was great   walking distance from many attractions and very close to the Beri UQAM metro station  We actually wound up staying in three different rooms because we shuffled our trip around after we arrived  We had planned to go to Mont Tremblant for a day and wound up going a day later than we planned  Albert was a great host and made it very convenient for us to switch rooms  I have to say the best part of the rooms was the awesome rain shower  Probably the best hotel shower experience I have ever had I hope we can plan another trip to Montreal and Le Relais Lyonnaise soon 
N => Good hotel in fascinating location Last time we visited Montreal we stayed in a big modern hotel downtown so this time we wanted something different which this certainly is It is housed in a typical Montreal Latin Quarter townhouse with an external iron staircase to the front door  the internal staircase is steep too  Our room was very stylish and immaculate but lacked some of the advertised features including a fridge   it would have been good to not have to go down to the cafe to beg milk every time we wanted to make tea in our room  It was also a little small for the price  However I was pleased it was at the back of the hotel as Rue St Denis is busy until late There are loads of places to eat on the doorstep many but not all catering for the student ket but the hotels cafe is recommended by several guides for its breakfasts and the nearby Confused tapas bar perfectly encapsulates the eclecticism of this area If you want to stay in the Latin Quarter and we certainly enjoyed doing so this is the place to choose  Otherwise you might get more for your money elsewhere  
N => Customer Service After seeing such great reviews I had to check out their websiteTheir online availability calendar showed rooms available for the weekend we were looking for on our honeymoon I called to book a room and was put through to the front desk The answer was swift and curt We are busy this summer  quotThere arent any rooms available at all for the whole summerquotquotNo  No rooms at all  Goodbye quotThanks a lot  
N => A very Merry Christmas My family and I stayed in two rooms over the Christmas holidays and couldnt have been more pleased  The owner Albert went out of his way to help us plan our sightseeing design our skiing trip   even pick which Boxing Day sales to visit The hotel itself was gorgeous and close to everything  We cant wait to go back in the summer 
N => Fantastic hotel We spent  nights at this lovely hotel  We had driven from Ottawa and got stuck in some roadworks traffic and arrived in Montreal later than expected so were running late for our booking at lExpress  The owner called the restaurant for us and arranged for the restaurant to hold the table for half an hour to allow us time to get there This simple gesture was much appreciated and was typical of the service received from him throughout the stay  The room was lovely  dark hardwood floors modern furniture a large comfortable bed and all the mod cons you need  The bathroom was large with a fablous showerhead that made you want to stay in the shower all day The hotel was in the perfect position  We walked everywhere and did not get back in our car until it was time to leave Montreal If I am in Montreal again I hope I will be fortunate enough to get a room again after all these good reviews 
N => Fantastic Hotel We just returned from a wonderful stay at the Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais in Montreal  Its hard to even know where to start    The location couldnt be better  surrounded by fantastic restaurants including the one in the hotel and a  minute walk to beautiful Old Montreal  We went to Montreal for a one night getaway from our home in Vermont to celebrate our nd wedding anniversary  We couldnt have imagined a more perfect stay  a huge bargain for the price The owners were incredibly kind and attended to every detail   minutes after wed arrived they knocked on our door with a plate of amazing homemade truffles  The room itself was incredible too  We stayed in a suite on the top floor  We were on the back of the building and didnt hear any sound from the street at all  The room was beautiful  very clean and modern and extremely comfortable  We especially enjoyed the private k  We wholeheartedly recommend the Hotel Le Relais Lyonnais  and we will certainly be back 
N => Home away from Home  
N => Good Little Hotel  
N => on aurait aim  y passer plus de temps     
N => Just as long as it is clean     I guess as long as the room is clean I am okay with it  It did have   stars on Hotwire com so I was happy with what we did get although initially I was leary about booking it  What swayed me is that it was the only one listed on Hotwire com offering breakfast  My girlfriend amp I spent just  nights there PROS The room was clean and the bathroom spotless although it did not have a clean fresh smell a little reeze would have been nice   The room had a small frig and enough utensils and cups for  people but no dishes  They provided you dishwashing liquid amp sponge  Breakfast which included your basic continental offerings did its job in keeping our bellies full until late afternoon  You could toast your bagels or sliced bread  In addition to hot beverages the only hot breakfast item that you could make was oatmeal from packets amp hotwater  It was close to the Metro  You are within walking distance to many eateries  Beds were nice and firm not so soft as where you can feel every spring  It was just right for me  You had a coffee maker in your room but dont ask for extra coffee unless you are willing to pay a dollar more  Staff helpful and hospitable although there was the microwave incident  Room with two double beds was roomy  In fact it was more roomy then most other  bedded rooms that I have stayed in  If you are an older person in your late s that loves to dance to contemporary dance music you  want to check out Club Thursdays on Rue Crescent  We found that it was happening on Saturday night with an older crowd  Unless you are drinking shots of straight liquor I would advise to stay with beer  The mixed drinks sucked CONS NO MICROWAVE OR STOVE even though it was listed in Hotwire com  including tax per night  As soon as we arrived we had asked for a microwave and were told that one would be delivered to us   it never came I was amazed at the number of derelicts they had in that immediate area  Although my girlfriend and I  females did not feel fearful they were annoying with their begging  We are from the NYC area and nowadays you dont see as many beggars in Manhattan as we saw in Downtown Montreal we were astonished The hotels parking is underneath a nearby hotel it is down a steep narrow one lane driveway be careful not to scratch the side of your car  From what we saw there is only one way in and one way out which is quite dangerous since it very narrow  It is a very small parking garage with  levels and you CANT park on level  closest to the entryexit  If you are claustrophobic this is definitely not for you since the ceiling height is low as well  I dont believe an SUV would fit in it  I dont believe it is worth  plus taxes per day parking fee since parking right next to hotel in an open lot is just   per day but as I read on internet the attendant in the open lot does not stay there all night so your car  disappear  I didnt want to take the risk especially with NJ license plates  There has to be cheaper alternatives nearby but I didnt have the chance to investigate  Parking in downtown Montreal is expensive but then again nothing beats Manhattan in terms of ridiculous parking prices  Like I once told a Manhattan attendant quotI dont want to buy the parking space I just want to borrow it for a short whilequot As tourists you can no longer recoup the taxes you paid on goods you purchased  Canada terminated that program in il of  although if you purchased your hoteltour package as part of a tour group those taxes you can still recoup  Ah shucks Getting back to the hotel there were no dressers or bureaus to layout your clothing only closets   Our box springs appeared to be filthy mine with what appeared to be coffee stains  The hotel would be well advised to steam clean amp cover up those box springs with bed skirts  Do not take a room that faces the main streets  We were awakened to the sounds of the derelicts arguing in front of the hotel traffic and street cleaning in the very early morning hours   It was rare to see a Montreal Police Officer in the streets it would have given me a greater sense of security  Although I hear that Montreal is pretty safe hey but you never know Crazy people are all around I have included pictures of our room that were not included in the Hotels website All in all I would stay at the Hotel Le Roberval again  
N => Suite with barely adequate air conditioning Suite was clean but spare  Pictures on internet are misleading   suite appears larger and more spacious than it is wide angle lens  Suite has one wall air conditioner in bedroom to service the whole suite  AC noisy  Wireless internet access promised does not exist  Wired internet broken staff was called and eventually on second day wired internet repaired  Front desk staff placed a credit card hold of  on my credit card but failed to advise me that it was hotel policy  Maid service was not done until the third day of a  day stay  Not a good value for service received  Ive traveled to Montreal for years and for the price there are many other options with better accommodations  
N => Dont go to this Hotel I had a very bad experience They are very materialist  they wouldnt consider you as a person  all they interest them is to make you pay more Bad roomsBad serviceBad everythingPatricya 
N => Clean Priced Right Close To Everything After a lengthy search to find a CLEAN place to stay for the weekend I ided on the Roberval being from Montreal I wanted a central place to stay close to the Metro but foremost CLEAN The Roberval did not disappoint me  We had  quad rooms there were  of us going to see the Habs play Toronto  Both rooms had  double beds your typical TV bathroom chair  writing table and an additional sink with limited cutlery  Which was fine I did not plan on cooking I noticed they had had outlets for a stove in both rooms but both stoves had been taken out  The hotel is now dedicated to Non smoking on every floor  The parking is   per night but is in a secured underground parking area  The breakfast was included each morning from   for all occupants it was bagels yogurt toast cereal coffee tea orange juice  Not bacon and eggs but enough to keep you happy and on your way  The hotel is walking distance to St  Catherines as well as many attractions  The casino I would take my vehicle there is about  minutes away the front desk will give you a map to get you there if you ask  The metro which is an excellent underground subway system is in walking distance from the hotel   We got a day pass unlimited for   each  We took the Metro to the Bell Centre we preferred to just keep our car in the hotel parking since it can be a bit dicy getting a parking spot in Montreal and we would just have to pay for additional parking anyway  The cost for each room was   plus tax  Compared to other hotels I had had my friends who still reside in Montreal check out this was by far the best  Something I should add is I hate the way usual hotel rooms have carpeting everywhere and who knows what has been on it  At the Roberval a good portion of it was tiling which is good especially if you have allergies  The limited carpeting that was on the floor was immaculate  I know other reviews have said that it was not quite what they expected and I can see by the pictures on the web site it had to have been prior to the reation which was going on in the small lobby when we arrived  But if you want a CLEAN well located hotel and dont want to pay   per night for a bed to sleep in this should be your pick  When we first approached the entrance it almost looked like an apartment and the lobby is a bit on the small side but we were not there to hang around a lobby nor were we there to sit in a hotel bar which they do not have we were there to sleep and go out and enjoy the night life of Montreal  I hope your stay is as pleasant as our was we could not have asked for anything better  I have told my friends in Toronto about this hotel and will be making this hotel my place to stay anytime I am in Montreal again  
N => Never stay there they are cheats and liers I booked the hotel for a  night stay through Hotels com over the phone and asked specifically that time to the agent while booking if the parking was included because parking is ridiculously priced in Montreal and can be very expensive  I was specifically told multiple times by the representative that it is included with the cost of renting the rooms and Iwould not be charged anything extra for it  I was told multiple times since I asked multiple times specifically about the parking charges  Anyways when I went to Montreal to rent the room I was told my Mr Samuel who was sitting on the front desk that night that the parking charges were not included in my hotel stay and I would have to pay extra for it when I explained to him that I was told so specifically by the booking agent that the parking is included in the cost of renting the room this guy agreed to it and told me its not a problem and he would put that in the contract and I wouldnt have to pay any extra for it  Total lieWhen I was checking out at the end of my  night stay there the front desk person tells me that I owe them  extra for the parking charges in additon to the room charges that were already paid and they would charge my credit card for that  When I interrupted her and told that I was assured during my check in by the front desk person that the parking charges will not be charged extra she says she is not aware of any such thing and they are entitled to being paid for the parking charges  When I asked to be spoken to with the person who checked me in she tell me that he is not here now  After much deliberation and wait I was made to talk to a supervisior on the phone who kept repeating the same thing  When I asked to speak to her in person she maid me wait gt  min in the lobby and when she did come she said the same statement as she uttered over the phone  When I asked her to speak to htis Samuel guy for clarifying the matter myself she said she would tak to him herself when he comes back to work that night  when I asked her to call me about the results of her discussion with her later that day she said she would and she even took down by number  She also said she would not charge my credit card till she speaks t o this guy  Anyways the outome of the matter she never called me backthough I expected at least a courtesy call from her and after a month of my stay there I see my credit card being charged for their exorbitant parking charges  The name of their supervisor was Viviane  I advise anyone going to Montreal to be aware of this parking scam where they make try desperately to make more moneyAnd if you have to pay for it you can use other open garages that are much cheaper andor stay in a better hotel that would charge for the parking but at least would have better services Total lierscrooks  
N => Good value but only smoking rooms The room was large and had a clean kitchenette  The only problem is that I booked a non smoking room to find out that most rooms are for smokers and so we also got one  It was clean but the smell was terrible  We had found a last minute offer so the price was good and the location is amazing but I would not stay there again unless I have a non smoking room  
N => not so good The concpet of a kitchen in the hotel room is great but if it is not cleaned it is a disgusting idea  It does not make any sense to pay extra money to have a kitchen cleaned and it makes even less sense to not clean it at all  The room was big and comfortable but we had to kill some bugs when we were there  I am now having trouble sleeping in my own bed becuase when I returned home from this vacation with a rash I learned that these were bed bugs and now fear that my own home is invested with this disgusting insect  I will never stay at this hotel again and if anyone reading this ides to stay here I would suggest not staying in room  becuase the couch is infested with bed bugs  
N => Basic hotel  but not recommended Upon checking in we got a small dark room with lingering nicotine smell with windows that face directly to the next building brick wall  We insisted to switch to a better room We then finally got a ent room only to be surprised that maids do not clean the kitchen area  So you can imagine how dirty the pots glasses and utensils are  I mean do guests really care to clean stuffs they use Its not like theyll use it again The breakfast was OK  But on first morning there my bf found lipstick ks in his juice glass  That just put an ick factor to the meal The hotel doesnt seem to be professionally run either  This is just not what I expect from a hotel  It looks more like a cheap motel  The bed is uncomfortable and the linen looks dirty too  The best thing abt this place is location  The Berri Metro where  other metro lines intersect is right around the corner  Its also  mins walk to old montreal abt  mins walk to chinatown  The hotel is located in the latin quarter area  The location cant be beat  Next time Ill stay somewhere else  I will never come back to this hotel again 
N => Enjoyed stay Cute very very clean hotel full kitchen in the rooms and table and chairs  Breakfast was ok but you have to stay in the small breakfast room and eat instead of going to your room  
N => Absolute Crap This should not be a quotHotelquot its more like a Rooming House or Hostel The room was disgusting dirty especially the shower extreme mold bed comforter wassoiled from previous guest  Paid for  nights but we left after  night  My youngest dhter called this place the quotHOLEquot 
N => Dump I was greeted to the smell of ijuana upon my arrival  I would be greeted to this scent for the remainder of my stay The service was good and the staff was bilingual  This was the only good thing about the stay The room was hilarious  The room was the size of a postage stamp  The lamp was missing its lampshade  The bathroom light fixture was to have three light bulbs but only one light bulb was present There were dust bunnies all over the floor and it appeared the room hadnt been vacuumed in some time  I dont think a vacuum could fit in that room I noticed a dead spider in my tub  I left it there to see how thorough their cleaning was  It was still there upon my return in the evening The mirror on the closet was broken and was comically taped into place with packing tape What was not so comical was the thickness of the walls  I could clearly hear the activities of the people two rooms down   you cannot imagine how clear the sounds of the activities occuring in the next room were I have stayed in hostels and hotels all over the world and never have encountered something like this   especially in my own country  I was shocked  I am not one to complain and I have never written a review for a hotel ever before but after that stay I felt compelled The location was the only good thing  I guess you get what you pay for  Even so the price was still very high considering what you get By the way   I couldnt find any bed bugs   I checked  
N => Great Location   Not as bad as the reviews I read I chose this hotel because of the value and the location  I was surprised to find it was better than I expected after having read the reviews here  The report of bedbugs was concerning but I didnt read that review until after I booked and prepaid for the hotel  I checked the beds as soon as I entered the room and was relieved not to have any  In fact what I found was a very clean room and new sheets and pillows on both beds  The hotel staff was very accommodating  They even called a cab for me as I was leaving the hotel at AM  The free wi fi in my room worked very well  I was in room  a deluxe double room which had ample space and a very clean bathroom  The only complaint I can think of is the walls are a bit thin but not so much that I was awakened  I was more concerned the creaky floor would wake other guests when I woke up at AM for my trip to the airport  
N => Bedbugs One word sumizing about my experience Bedbugs  
N => Small Hotel but Great This is hotel is really good to a short stay as we did  The room was small but comfortable and clean  A very important thing The bathroom was brandnew and very clean too  The breakfast is not too much believe me    But those days we eat everything they had  Good Choice Good Price    
N => Good location poor quality The St  Malo claims to be a three star hotel but its far from it  The owners are quite delusional if they think that this establishment deserves a high rating    no elevator horrible breakfast could it even qualify as food Dont ingest it cheap reation poor quality beds strange smell in the bathroom dirty walls staff barely speaks English or French cloaged drains broken faucets fake wall tiles in bathroom windows facing dirty alley etc The location is good and the price not so bad but please dont call it a three star hotel 
N => Malaise at the Malo My ex wife booked this hotel for two rooms as we gathered to help our son start university nearby  I arrived on a Friday    The phone in my room didnt work and the staff couldnt fix it or replace it saying the phone company would come on Monday to fix this most basic of services  They were gracious enough to allow me to use their wireless phone if I walked down to the lobby to fetch and return it   I returned to the hotel on my first day to hear the front desk say quotwe couldnt clean your room because you locked the bathroom door from inside and we cant open itquot  In  ades of internatl travel Ive never locked myself out of a bathroom   More interesting was that it took them about  hours to open the door despite the existence of a little hole in the knob designed to pop the lock   My rooms front door comes with a deadbolt lock to lock out crims at night but it didnt work nor was there a chain  There was just one flimsy easy to pick door handle type lock   I had to reset the digital clock at least once a day because the housekeeper kept unplugging it to make the bed    The staff doesnt speak English OR French very clearly    but you can get by in Mandarin   poor sound proofing between rooms   the complementary breakfasts are a joke    the first morning there werent any hot beverage cups even though the coffee was brewed  So this hotel is a BYO hotel re bring your own door lock and lock pick bring your own landline phone bring your own complimentary breakfast bring your own Chinese English French translator  They staff were very pleasant  
N => Over    stay away If youre  or over you probably dont want to put up with a hotel like this  If your under    this is probably your idea of a really NICE hostel  First of all our room was in the basement  Then our heat wasnt working and we asked them to fix it  times before it was fixed   this is ember people   its cold  Also we found a bug in our room and bug residue on the walls from someone killing one before we got there  Ok could that be nastierIts in a ent enough location   but I recommend staying somewhere else  
N => This place is a joke We booked one night at Le Saint Malo for a sporting event  For the price we paid we were in complete shock when we saw the size of the room  Also the room was located literally beside the front desk we could hear every word the front desk clerk was saying  Note this hotel does not have anyone working from am onwards until the early morning  Why is this I have my personal thoughts which I will not disclose  I believe there is a moral responsibility here to ensure the safety of the guests  Long story short could not sleep as the floors creek tremendously  The guests above whom were walking around set off a creek fest in the floor above us  To add the front desk phone was ringing off the hook     we later learned that it was the police calling as there was a disturbance call in the hotel and the police could not enter the building as a code is required after am as there is no one working at those hours The biggest concern I have and would like to notify readers of is that someone tried to enter our room in the middle of the night  I had to call the police as my wife was petrified and I was very concerned for her safety  All in all I am very disillusioned about this hotel as I would not expect the hotel to be on some of the travelhotel portals  This is not the type of hotel to take your family to  Take my wordSeasoned traveler 
N => Perfectly pleasant This was one of the cheapest places I could find in Montreal so I didnt have very high expectations   but was pleasantly surprised by the clean comfortable amp quiet room with large amp sparkling bathroom  Its nothing special but I would recommend it as a good basic choice in a very convenient location  Check out Le Petit Moisson Boulangerie a few blocks away for outstanding pastries BTW   parking was an extra night in a locked garage    tho you can find cheaper in nearby open air parking lots  
N => Stay Away I stayed at Le Saint Malo for four days and had a very disappointing experience  Im a budget traveler so I knew what to expect but Le Saint Malo does not even provide budget basics  The staff was extremely rude the hotel was quite noisy and there was an non securebroken door in the hallway on my floor leading from the hotel to the building next door which made me feel extremely unsafe and it was left broken for the last two nights of my stay  I complained to the staff about the broken hallway door and was told quotnever mind go back to your room quot The building next door which I had access to through the broken doors on my floor had beer bottles on its stairwell and was in generally poor condition In addition to this lack of concern for guest safety the staff also refused to provide basic services  I asked the staff to call the airport shuttle for me to make my return reservation and they refused  The staff member handed me the phone number and said I needed to make the call myself  Also some people have speculated that the poor service is due to the fact that the staff speaks French but I speak enough French to get by and this did not improve the service  I highly recommend that travelers stay away from this hotel  Some friends of mine had much better luck and better prices at some of the local BampB s  
N => Exactly what we were looking for My wife and I stayed at the Saint Malo for the weekend  nightsand would definitely stay again  Make sure that you book your parking space in advance  spaces for  roomsas we were left the first night without hotel parking   we did park in a garage down the street but did not have enter amp exit privileges  We paid  CDN for three nights tax included plus  per night for parking local calls were   each The hotel itself is three stories with   rooms per floor and  or  in the basement  I would not want to stay on the main floor as it opens directly into the lobby when I was in the lobby for ice I could hear a woman giggling from her room  We stayed in   rd floorand found it to be in excellent condition  New furnituretv carpet bedding tub shower etc  We had an iron and board in our room ice box hair dryer and clock radio  When I walked by other rooms the maid was cleaning they all appeared to be the same  The windows were old but could be opened to let in fresh air  We had a thermostat in our room but always found it to be a little warm so we left the window open at night the blinds kept out the light  One night we had a trumpet player on the corner playing everything from Hockey Night in Canada to Oh When The Saints Come ching In     Continental breakfast was provided in the morning  The only negative I could find with this hotel was the size of the room  It was small   about X but what do you really need the space forSt  Catharine Street is about  paces from the front door and you could walk down to Crescent Street in about   minutes  We took a cab that cost  with the tip  There is a taxi stand on the corner of Rue de Fort and St  Catharine so you never have to wait for a cab  Around the corner to the left is the Italian Rotisserie a diner type restaurant with AMAZING Italian food our bill was under   To the right is a  hour diner that fit the bill for after the bar food Service was slow but the place was packed and there was only one waitress   food was good If you eat meat you cannot go to Montreal and not go to Schwartzs Deli St  Laurent Blvd    not walking distance  quotThe best place in the Milky Way to sample smoked meat sandwichesquot   Time MagazineThere was a  minute wait on the street to get in but it was WELL worth it  Again our bill was under Back to the Saint Malo we had a great stay it was definitely worth our money and we will go back  
N => Not so good but not too bad either Our room was in the basement  When I say the room was small its a huge understatement  There was two of us in the room and deffinetly felt like needed more space  Pretty plain room with a bed small TV with lots of channels table chair closet and dresser  There was no bathtub only a shower and it was tiny  The bathroom was very small  We had a big fan in the room for air conditioning  The room was clean  There was no soundproofing as we could hear people talking and entering and exiting their rooms  There were some donuts and muffins at the front desk for breakfast which was a nice touch  Staff was friendly and helped us in booking a tour to Quebec Citywhich I highly recommend Montreal has a lot to see and do  We were only in the room at night  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a clean room to sleep in overnight  Do not expect too much and you will not be disapointed  Deffinetly not a luxury hotel  There is a  star rating outside the hotel  In my oppinion thats somewhat high I would say more like  stars  
N => I wish I had had the room that the other reviewers were in Unknown to me my visit to Montreal partially overlapped with Grand Prix  It was next to impossible to find an affordable room in town so I was stuck with what I got  Firstly my room was in a basement and there were no bars on the windows  This put me off as a woman travelling alone but also there was no possiblity of a breath of fresh air  There is no dedicated safety deposit for valuables and no extra ID was taken when the front desk took them from me of gave them back to me  However in the basement I felt this was somewhat safer than leaving my passport in the room The vacuuming was truly limited to the center of the room  a button on the baseboards next to the bed was there for the whole visit of  nights and my hair was never picked up off the bathroom floor  Although the toilet had been changed the old grouting had been left on the tiles and was brown and grubby where the new fixture was smaller than the old  However the bed linens appeared to be very clean and the sink and shower were also attended to  For this I had the privilege of paying  on the Friday as it was Grand Prix  Still love Montreal but I would not stay here again if there was another choice  
N => Great Place Great price It was a great find right downtown Montreal  The service was very friendly and the rooms are brand new  I felt at home there  I was able to connect to high speed wireless internet magasines were available in the room and everything was new and comfortable   
N => Malo in spanish means bad Probably the worst hotel ever  I stayed one day and had my personals stolen  I even cht the owner on a lie  He claims my cell phone got mixed up the linen   funny I did not know that cell phones could walk from the table to the dirty linen  A camera that was put in the room was taken while we were out  The only person that had a key was me and the attendant  Also the blood stains on the box spring were a little odd  Had to buy air freshener to change the smell in the bathroom Do yourself a favour pay a little extra to get a reputable hotel  We learned our lessons  
N => Great honeymoon hotel We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for the first half of our honeymoon  The value was incredible The room was huge and the location cant be beat  We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go  Ive read others complaints about the complicated breakfast process but my husband and I never had any issues  We thought it was perfectly fine especially considering the room rate  We had a wonderful dinner at S  The thing that stood out most about the hotel was the service  it was impeccable The concierge was very attentive and friendly  For example when our luggage was left behind by our airline and we werent likely to get it delivered to the hotel until  in the morning the concierge offered to bring us complimentary toiletries and carefully checked our preferences for contacting us when it arrived  I was exhausted by that time and so greatful for their help  
N => Fantastic We loved this hotel  The location friendliness of staff and room were everything we could have asked for  This was our first trip to Montreal but will not be our last The staff knows Montreal well and anyone you ask is more than happy to recommend things to do places to see or restaurants to visit  Everything else has been said by others so no need to again state all the details of a stay here  Highly recommend  
N => Great location in Old Montreal My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Le Saint  Sulpice very much  It s in an ideal location just behind the Notre Dame Basilica and just a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station Place dArmes or bus stop We enjoyed that the rooms have a little kitchenette as the first day we went to the Jean Talon ket to buy salami baguette cheese fresh fruits and wine  The room came equipped with everything we needed to have an enjoyable dinner in front of the fireplace dishes utensils wine glasses etc  they even have microwave refrigerator and two burner stove  The included continental breakfast was great as well and we had good service each morning  Otherwise we didnt eat at the hotel restaurant but we did have some enjoyable meals just a few minutes walk from the hotel Resident Olive and Gourmando Europea Espace When we first arrived our toilet made a loud leaking noise every five minutes so we called down and a service man was in our room within a few minutes  He was very friendly and helpful and did his best to fix it  After he left it started leaking be every  minutes but we werent going to complain about it  When we got back to our room from dinner that night we realized that it was no longer leaking  We assume that the service man came back to our room to fix it when we werent there because it was fine for the remainder of our stay  If management is reading this  we are very appreciative of his helpThe only reason Im not giving St  Sulpice the full five stars is while still nice the rooms could stand for new carpet and paint and possibly new televisions  Also the first towel I picked up had some long strands of hair stuck to it which made me hesitant about the cleanliness of the hotel but that was my only negative experience  
N => My ideal boutique hotel experience I was a little nervous about staying at the Hotel Le Saint Sulpice when we couldnt drive on the street where the hotel was located because of construction  I had read on TripAdvisor that there was work going on in front of the hotel but I had thought it would have been finished by late y  But my fears were quickly allayed by the front desk staff who even though our room was not yet ready made sure we were taken care of    and upgraded us to a suite in the quieter back part of the hotel  We had requested a quiet room  We also mentioned we were celebrating our th wedding anniversary which seemed to impress the young woman at the front desk After going for a long walk around the Vieux Port we returned to find our room ready  And what a room It was fantastique One of the nicest rooms we have EVER stayed in    and we have stayed in several four  and five star properties around the world  Not only was the room quiet it was good sized clean chic and very comfortable  I dont typically sleep well on the road but I slept wonderfully at the Hotel Le Saint Sulpice  Didnt even need to wear my ear plugs or put on my sleep mask  Equally wonderful was the service we received during our three days at the Hotel Le Saint Sulpice  From the front desk to the concierge Etienne to the valets to housekeeping was polite professional and eager to please Also the breakfasts  Oo la la There were fresh homemade  croissants and pain au chocolat every morning which were delicious as well as fresh fruit cheese yogurt and cereal bread to toast and probably a few things I am leaving out  They also provided wonderful fresh squeezed orange juice and the best hotel af I have ever tasted Next time we go back to Montreal    and there will be a next time    we will definitely be staying at Hotel Le Saint Sulpice again  
N => Nice place to stay in the old part of Montreal We stayed for  nights at this hotel  staff was helpful  Room was comfortable  Good central location mid in the romantic old Montreal close to great restaurants and easy to get around town  Concierge helpful in arranging side trips and restaurant recommendations  All in all a good stay 
N => Beautiful convenient great location but customer service needs help Loved the location and I would stay in the Old Montreal District again but would probably try a different location because I was a little insulted but some of the staff members at the Le Saint Sulpice  Call sensitive but if we are going to a  star hotel then w expect the staff to offer the same four star customer service  Entering and exiting the hotel the doormanCharles rarely offer a greeting  We have been here for  days the staff should by now recognize us by now not even a quothow is your stay here at the Le Saint Sulpicequot  At one time we asked that our room be cleaned while we were out when we returned obviously zero communication the room was still not cleaned  Out in front of the hotel the streets were a mess construction was going on unrelated to the hotel but it was not handicap fdriendly and we struggled to manouver our wheelchair  The question would I recommend the hotel to a friend yes  for its convenience  I will acknowledge the wait staff in the dining roomRene very nice  
N => Grand S package I took this Grand S package  I am from Montreal area and wanted to take my girlfriend on a romantic stay this weekend friday ch rd to saturday  Package includes diner one night in a superior suite breakfast and two one hour massage A couple of hours before our arrival someone from the hotel called us to tell us one of the massotherapist called sick and would not be available  Ask for a raincheck but could not get it  Reason  quotits part of the package and cannot be taken on a different dayquot Strike oneOn our arrival I discovered that I had to pay  more for parking  Knowing the area believe me you better pay  They know it too Strike two Breakfast next morning was continental  That I already knew  Sad thing is that one of the staff almost completely ignored us  I just played a little test and did not say a word just to see how long it would take them to realize that we had nothing to drink    took them almost half an hour Strike threeRoom was clean and nice  Bed not so comfortable    but for a price near  dollars not worth it 
N => Tres Fantastiique Girls weekend Had a suite facing courtyard quiet  Balcony was important to us as it was summer and the weather was suitable to sit on k and enjoy the breeze  The staff were very helpful   always Location Location Location  Hotel met all our needs from internet needs to dining to concierge services Great for three people   we had plenty of room  All the amenities of a boutique hotel  The one lacking aspect was the breakfast which you pay anyways   you might as well use  understaffed but the ones present were very gracious  My friends loved the choice and said many a time that they would come back to Saint Sulpice  Well Done   take a bow 
N => modern hotel in old montreal A very nice hotel in old montreal  Very clean modern interior  Comfortable bed  Got a free room upgrade Breakfast was ok with cold food for eggssausage had to pay extra  
N => Le Saint Sulpice was a delightful stay in the heart of Old Montreal  Le Saint Sulpice was a delightful stay in the heart of Old Montreal  Granted Montreal has some funky neighborhoods and unusual BampBs but we could stay in Vieux Montreal and easily walk to those neighborhoods  or take the metro from the Place DArmes station  The staff at Saint Sulpice was very helpful when we needed any help which was just once on arrival to adjust the air conditioning  Breakfast was included in the room price also good because eating out every meal in Old Montreal can add up quickly  It is tres chic and the prices are too  The or was well done  The bathroom was exceptional with large walk in shower  All in all very good value for the area  
N => Great Location Upon arrival at Le Saint Sulpice checked into my one bedroom suite  Room was extremely spacious and bathroom was the biggest I have ever seen in a hotel  The non smoking floor however did not seem to apply to my suite which smelled of smoke like someone was smoking outside of their window  Great location as we had a reunion with our friends only blocks away  We paid  for our suite including breakfast and  select a more standard room for our next visit  
N => Appalling service This review reflects our experience with having booked a day long meeting including food service and lunch at the quotSquot restaurant in the hotel on e   The room for the meeting was not prepared when we arrived No staff were assigned to check in on us so we had to go to the front desk each time they quotforgotquot the coffee tea etc    At the quotSquot restaurant over lunch each of the dishes was cold we were  people seated steps away from the kitchen Of the   of the dishes the fish was served uncooked   a white fish not meant to be served raw When we pointed this out the surly unhappy waiter took them back and returned them   the dishes returned were partly eaten and not the ones we returned nor quotnewquot dishes   the folks who returned their dishes opted not to eat and the waiter offered nothing in replacement  One member asked for chicken instead and got another piece of fish At no time did the maitre dhotel or supervisory staff come by to explain   even though we asked  We alerted the manager but even she did nothing and indeed no supervisory staff came up to the meeting room at any time during the day to explainA complete lack of a sense of customer service   appalling food service  While at the front desk in a desperate attempt to get an explanation a woman with a senior in a wheelchair explained to the front desk that the shower chair they had provided for her mother broke  One of our party had the misfortune of sitting on a sofa that fell over broken leg in the lobby  Stay at the Nelligan    
N => Delightful We just spent  delightful nights at Le Saint Sulpice  We chose the hotel based on the reviews here and were not disappointed in the least  Our superior suite was spacious and clean  The location of the hotel just off of St  Paul Street and in the heart of the Old Port area was perfect  The staff was helpful and friendly at all times  Breakfast buffet It was most definitely as advertised a continental breakfast  coffee croissants and juice   and fruit cereal yogurt toast muffins  and all quite fresh  I found that if something was missing all I had to do was ask for it  I also enjoyed the slower pace of the restaurant service and not just in the hotel it was so nice to get away from the quotlets see how many times we can turn over this tablequot meets quotI was running late when I walked in and I have to leave  minutes agoquot atmosphere Our suite We booked a superior suite  As expected it was spacious  Even though we faced the street the room was quiet  We never heard our neighbors or noise from outside  We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning  
N => Not a Good Choice for Families We recently completed a five day trip with our children to Montreal and Quebec City  Of the three hotels we visited this was by far our worst experience  Upon arriving to our room we were discouraged to find that they had placed us in a first floor room at street level  This meant that people walking by the hotel or eating in the cafe across the street peered into our room whenever everything wasnt kept closed This was particularly a problem because the air conditioning unit in our room wasnt working and we needed to open the windows to cool down the very hot room  Every time we drew back the sheers and opened the windows in came the peeping eyes and assault of the busy street level noise and activity After assessing the situation we called the front desk and told them of the problems we were having with the room  They sent someone to fix the air conditioning unit and assured us that the situation was revolved  Upon returning from dinner and and a stroll some hours later we found that the air conditioner was still not working and the room was still very hot  Because we were traveling with two children we called the office again and asked to be moved to a different room  At  at night they downgraded us from our one bedroom suite to a smaller ior suite with a working air conditioner and we were finally able to put our children to bed  It should be noted that we received no compensation for our inconveniences and room downgrade  Later in the trip we stayed at the Chateau Frontenac and the Loews Hotel Vogue and our experience at both of these hotels was wonderful  We cant imagine why anyone would choose this hotel when traveling to the region when there are so many great options available  We did notice a number of older guests at the hotel so be this is the hotels intended target ket but we cant imagine our parents sleeping in a hot room with no privacy  
N => terrible restaurant nice rooms towels are stiff and so are the robes as if they havent been used in years restaurant was terrible even the breakfast was bad  
N => Lovely Hotel in Old Montreal My husband amp I stayed at this hotel from  ember until th ember   We found the hotel staff to be most helpful and courteous  We stayed in room  which had a arate bedroom with a kingsize bed  The hotel is exactly as shown on their website and we were really pleased with our choice of hotel  It is an ideal location for walking around Montreal  The weather was extremely cold minus  at times and during the weekend we had a really bad snow storm  I have never seen so much snow in all my life We have friends that live on the other side of the Montreal river who kindly showed us around Montreal and took us up to Mont Sauveur which was about an hour and a quarter away from the centre of Montreal  My husband amp I ate at The Keg restaurant which was round the corner from the hotel  The food and drink was very good We only had breakfast at the hotel which was basic cereal fresh fruit toast small chocolate croissants etc but perfectly adequate  You could have sausages eggs amp bacon but had to pay extra for it  All in all we enjoyed our brief time in Montreal and would love to go back again hopefully in the summer months next time  We walked all round Montreal went to Eaton Square and various shopping malls etc  Its a lovely place to visit  If you stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed with your choice of hotel  Please contact me if you want any further information Little tip if you need to get to the airport and the weather is bad allow plenty of time   it took us an hour and a half to get to the airport because of the bad weather conditions we were told by the hotel that the journey normally takes half an hour as the highway was solid nose to tail with traffic  I thought we werent going to make our flight back to the UK 
N => Over the top Friendly My husband and I had to travel to Montreal on business and within minutes of our arrival took the smiling suggestion of the reservations desk and extended our stay to two nights  The hotel is lovely   shares one or more of its walls with Notre Dame cathedral yet is very contemporary solid read as quotthickquot walls so we found it very quiet and immaculate  We selected Saint Sulpice based on location ability to bring our small dog and cost   and it didnt fail our expectations on any front  It was convenient to include our dachsund in our plans very much worth the extra  deposit to have her with us rather than kennel her and the exceptional staff had all three of us feeling more than welcome  Kudos to the conciergefront desk recommendations   we were steered right with every request for the where to eats and what to seesI strongly agree with the former reviewers commendation about the valets  They parked our oversized van right next to the hotel   safely and without complaint   quick to call our room when they were uncertain as to how to lock the side cabinets for us I loved our spacious room and small k  Just behind the hotel is a perfect grassy spot to walk the dog bring baggies The lawn and little garden is well kept  We found the down filled bedding very comfortable so our mattress was clearly not the same as the former reviewers  Our only complaint became a little joke between my husband and I   that the towels are far from soft  We lhingly called our drying off quotThe ExfoliationquotThis hotel far exceeded our expectations   especially when it came to service  Wed return   wouldnt stay elsewhere in Montreal   if it werent for the seven hour drive  
N => Not so sure I found it to be quite a rip off  Nothing looked like the pictures the hotel website provided  Everything looked smaller  My room was supposed to be a non smoking room but when I walked in I smelled cigarettes  The staff tried to get rid of it by bringing in this ozone machine thing  The smell did go away but came back the next morning  Thats when I realized that the smell came from the outside  Not only the smell penetrated the window so did the noise from car   However there is one good thing about this room  It has a really nice gorgeous bathroom  
N => Not that great My husband and our friends spent New Years weekend here and I must say I do not see why everyone is giving this hotel such good reviews  Yes the rooms are nice and spacious but that is the only thing that is nice about this place  The food was not good it was not fresh and tasted as if it was sitting out for hours before it was brought out to our table The service was not the service of a star hotel  We had a mix up with our suites and were told that one of them was canceled we did not get any apologies and were told that if they don t have cancellations we would just have to deal with it and share one suite which was okay considering they gave us an upgrade to a bigger room but they did not give us any extra towels toiletries or pillows needed for four people even after I called and requested it it was still never sent to us My overall experience was not a positive one therefore I would not be coming back to this hotel  However you get what you pay for and this hotel was not at all expansive considering the room size and the hotel location plus they give you free breakfast which was not bad  Another thing the hotel needs is a lounge or a bar they have about five chairs at the restaurant bar  which is not sufficient for a hotel this size and a little shop where guests can get things like coffe soda  or meds without having to leave the hotel  
N => Very Nice Hotel My girlfriend and I just spent Labor Day weekend at this hotel in Montreal and loved it  We are from NYC  yo and have travelled quite a bit The entire staff was extremely helpful  We were able to contact the concierge the week prior to our trip for restaurant recommendations and all were very good  Our flight was late and we had to push back dinner friday night a number of times and the concierge was helpful and courteous each time we called and took care of it for us  We stayed on the first floor in a basic suite deluxe i believe which was both quiet and spacious  It had a nice little terrace not like we used it but was still nice to have option  The bedroom was arate from the living room tvs in both    nice showers with good water pressure  We really had no complaints whatsoever about the hotel All of Montreal is within walking distance so dont feel like you have to stay in one particular area  Although I can understand if you wanted to stay in a more lively neighborhood  We ate most of our meals in Old Montreal by the hotel but there was little nightlife  Great for families or couples though    were young  yo but just wanted a quiet weekend so it was good for us  
N => Pretty Good but for the price Room smelled a bit funny from cleaning after a smoker very big nice room  But a bit of paint peeling on bathroom very large bathroom ceiling plus some discoloration here and there of grout and caulk also rust where mirror met sink Biggest gripe could hear elevator though  rooms away  The noise didnt bother spouse but slightly annoying for me light sleeper  Staff was sympathetic on complaining  They offered a different room which would be ready for us to look at quotbefore  noonquot  So couldnt go too far came back somewhat wasted morning to see alternate room at am  The alternate room smelled better but was a LOT smaller so ided to keep original room  Theyd offered to be see if yet another room but didnt want to waste anymore time on it and just dealt with it But the room was very very nice and except for slamming doors and loud talk at  am which involved a walkie talkie so I assume a staff member very very quiet  I e  from  or  midnight to  am no elevator and no doors closing it was very very quiet  And note none of these noises woke me up except the  am affair which was probably a fluke but if I was awake the noises tended to keep me awake Also patrons in courtyard bar were quite loud until  or midnight But overall a good experience I wonder if for night after taxes more should be expected in Montreal QC CA or not It seems all   stars hotels have their issues  I dont think hotels are made for light sleepers  I mean come on how hard would it be to sound proof doors closing and elevator shafts Even at the Fairmont in San Franciso wed stayed in the tower part last ober    very nice view and room and very very expensive where the doors slamming were very loud but luckily everyone seemed to be in by pm In Minneapolis we stayed at a  star in the famous building where the TV show was filmed quotThat Girlquot I think which was again very very nice and expensive but you could hear machinery all night and for a one night stay its more disturbing to change rooms than to just put up with it and never go back In short someone needs to make sound proof hotels with a sound proof guarantee  Until then light sleepers like me need to stay home  
N => Great hotel in old montreal I booked a room at St Sulpice for a long weekend with my  sisters  The lobby is beautiful the hotel quiet the staff wonderful  There was plenty of room for all of us to sleep put down our suitcases and still have the couch for lounging  We had a roll away bed plus the Queen sized bed in the room and left the sleeper sofa as a couch  The bathroom was huge with a big claw foot tub plus a standup shower big enough for two Two of us arrived at Noon before the stated check in time and they quickly found us a room that was already clean  Later the staff managed to find us to give us messages from family members even though not all of our names were on the registration form  They were so helpfulI will definitely want to stay there on next trip to Montreal  
N => Lived up to its reputation Everything about Le Saint Sulpice   accommodations location hospitality   was fantastic  We booked the quotFour Seasonsquot package which included breakfast and a  credit towards the nights stay  Breakfast was not the greatest but we very much enjoyed the cheese plate that we ordered from room service  Our deluxe suite was spacious modern clean and quiet   and the LOccitane toiletries were a nice touch  We were very impressed by the service we received from the conciergebellman  
N => Luxury great location amazing price A wonderful surprise  luxurious in a superb location attentive staff  We booked through a special on Expedia  price was much lower than similar properties and location seemed good  right in Old Montreal  We booked a ior Suite  Couldnt believe our good fortune when we arrived  A block from the river right in the heart of Old Montreal  The lobby was lovely  ble stylish furniture  Our Suite was a true Suite  a large living room arate bedroom  ample closets a large bathroom with lOccitaine bath products big shower high thread count linens a fireplace  The staff couldnt have been nicer always there to answer questions on restaurants tourist attractions  they even helped us find a better price on a rental car  Then when we checked out our balance due was  because we had pre paid through Expedia  This was unlike a recent experience with Hotels     which charged us service fees and taxes and then I was forced to pay additional service fees and taxes to the hotel adding  to my bill I would highly recommend the St  Sulpice to others and would definitely stay there again  
N => Stay here if you can afford it This is a fantastic hotel  Admittedly we had the most expensive suite but its an all suite hotel so each one should be spacious but the place was fantastic everyone was helpful and friendly NOT a given in Montreal believe me and they even rang to say wed left something in the room and did we want them to post it back  
N => wonderful stay We recently returned from Montreal and wanted to share a wonderful experience at Le Saint Sulpice    comfortable and clean elegant and attentive to detail  The one bedroom suite was ample and beds comfortable even the Murphy bed  The staff was responsive and eager to help make our stay memorable  Concierge was excellent  Highly recommend this hotel and will certainly return  
N => Stunning I like many others booked this hotel on the strength of all the reviews and was not dissapointed  Actually to start with we got off to a bad start our room was smoky  strange for a non smoking hotel  But this was dealt with brialliantly and we were given another room  I loved having the kitchenette the lovely extras such as ent tea the wonderful bed which was very comfortable and bathroom  Actually we did not enjoy Montreal itself too much Quebec was much nicer to us  But this hotel was worth a visit in its own right 
N => Not all its cracked up to be Perhaps wed been spoilt by the fabulous Auberge Saint Aintoine in Quebec City but the Saint Sulpice was a little bit of a disappointment  Its location is excellent but the room we were given which we subsequently discovered to be one of the smallest in the hotel was hardly the quotloft siuitequot it claimed to be  In fact it was not a suite at all   just one room   and given that the TV was opposite the bed rather than the sofa you couldnt even pretend it was a suite  The bed itself folded down from the wall which wasnt in itself much of a problem other than having to clamber in over a large frame but it was rather bizarre However our biggest gripe was the restaurant where almost unbelievably they allow smoking in all areas   I was just amazed by this  Also they short changed me on both occasions we ate there once could be a mistake but twice   Perhaps Im being fussy but I expect better at these prices  
N => Like having a Condo in a Great Location with a friendly staff We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for  nights  We got in very late  am the first night amp were greeted by two very nice amp helpful staff members  Anything we needed the staff would immediately accommodate us amp they also had great suggestions on where to go for entertainment etc  The food in the restaurant was incredible the chocolate torte was most delectable and the waiter tine never rushed us even after the restaurant was closed although the maitre de was not so friendly he was actually very rude both times we tried to dine there  The rooms were so comfortable with a goose down comforter and big bathroom  My room had a balcony amp living room which was great since we were traveling with friends when they came over we could quotentertainquot in our suite  I loved the location because we were a step a way from everything   we did so much walking  The jazz festival was  blocks north the port was one block south and touristy stuff was a few blocks away  I had a great time amp would definitely stay there again  
N => Rude Service I stayed at the St  Sulpice last ust for four nights  It was our fifth time staying in this hotel and my wife and I have always found it to be an exquisite place to stay in Old Montreal  However this time we had a problem  When flying in to Montreal my wallet was lost at the airport or in transit and I had to pay for my room in cash  This was not an issue for me whereas my wife had her ATM card and we had access to our   However the staff became extremely rude and were calling my room constantly demanding I come down to the front desk and pay for my room in advance for the day every day  They absolutely added insult to injury whereas my stay which is usually a pleasureable one turned into a real hassle because of my lack of having my credit card  Finally on the rd day Monday my bank sent a replacement card to the hotel  I packed our luggage went down to the desk and promptly checked out It was unfortunate that the staff did not look into their records to see that I was a frequent guest at their hotel who did not deserve to be treated this way  Yes it is a beautiful hotel but if you should stay there and find yourself with a small problem as we did you are better off packing you bags and checking into The riott as we did 
N => Be aware We recently stayed at the St Sulpice for a weekend and was treated terribly  It first began with the valet being rude as he thought be because I was driving an inexpensive  Toyota Camry I should not park in front of the hotel  He was extremely rude while informing me and my wife that it was for GUests Only He was shocked to learn we were guests  Check in was a disaster as they could not find our rsvp Good thing my wife printed the confirmation letter After seeing our room we felt better but it was dirty still The bellman apologized and we returned to the lobby until it could be fixed  One Hour later For the price we paid they did not even compensate us with anything Breakfast the next morning was good but the staff didnot have any information on bus tours and seemed clueless Overall  it was not a memorable experience and I unfortunately cannot reccommend this hotel  It is it worth  Never 
N => Highly recommended   will be going back    Just returned from a  day stay at the Saint Sulpice  Very comfortable and quiet  I would not hesitate to go back  I found the best rate through bonjourquebec  Cheap delicious breakfast just around the corner at Cafe St  Paul on St  Paul St   
N => stars concierge for  stars establishment Wow wowwow The only word that can come up out my mouth  I came up to Montreal with my wife to celebrate our anniversary  I had called the concierge Patrick for him to arrange my weekend  Man did he make it memorable I think it was more memorable than my wedding  I left it all in his hands and all that he said was  Leave it to me I promise you wont regret it  He had arranged scented candles flowers a sound system with all romantic tunes that would put the right atmosphere in the room the wood fireplace the rose petals a poem written by him wine champagne strawberries massages the best restaurants carridge ride etc  He is the CasaaDon Juan of all concierges  I dont know where they got him but he sure made our anniversary a weekend to reminisce forever  Last but not least the room was superb and spaceous and the rest of the staff was up to par with the highest standards  Bell staff co Roger Dave Rafael was very helpful  Way to go Le St Sulpice 
N => Personnel must be paid poorly We stayed at the Saint Sulpice in the middle of ust  The suite was very nice and tastefully furnished  Beds were fine  The room faced the courtyard so there was not much street noise and no noise at all could be heard from other rooms in the hotel  So obviously the place is very well insulated The only thing which really got on our nerves was the blatant and often even impertinent demanding of tips   or as they call it quotgratuitiesquot  You are expected to tip as soon as the waiterbell boy etc  even lifts a finger  Since breakfast buffet was included in our room price we didnt feel that we have to tip the waiter who only poured coffe and orange juice anyway  Boy were we wrong He got quite upset finding out we didnt leave money for him on the table and made his discontent known to us We dont even want to blame the employees so much but the management should think about paying their employees a ent salary so that they dont have to beg like that  Im sure the directors of the hotel dont have to rely on tips to survive 
N => Le Saint Sulpice   Great Experience Staff accommodations and restaurant were all superior  Room was large and as nicely oratedfurnished as their pictures advertise  Staff was great with recomendations on anything we asked about  Location was perfect in the heart of Vieux Montreal   close to port Champs de s Palace de Arms and Metro  We cant wait to return to Montreal and will surely consider Le Saint Sulpice once again  
N => Absolutely the best This hotel exceeded our expectations  The location right behind Notre Dame was wonderful as was everything about the experience  The room was huge and well appointed with every convenience we could have desired  Furnishings were contemporary but simple and the building although only a few years old fit in beautifully in this historic neighborhood  The service was superlative  We would recommend this hotel without reservation  
N => Needs Work I loved the or of this hotel  The rooms were relatively large and tastfully done  However unless you sleep on the floor at home prepare yourself for a poor nights sleep on these very hard beds  They certainly werent condusive to a good nights sleep   much less a quotromanticquot weekend  I slept on the couch  of the  nights  As for breakfast vouchers I advise you not to eat in the hotels restaurant  I ate breakfast there  days  The first was barely acceptable and the second was not eatable  I sent it back because it was cold and it returned burned  The waitstaff obviously has not been trained or just doesnt care   in sharp contrast to the front desk personnel who were very helpful  I wouldnt recommend this hotel but with some work it could be a gem  
N => Good but dont be too cheap My girlfriend and I stayed there for  nights over New Years weekend and had a very nice time  Great sized room good sized bathroom etc  She said it was the best place weve stayed and I couldnt really disagree Tip though    I booked through hotels I believe expedia would have same result because it was the cheapest rate by a few dollars  It ended up not saving any money because a the breakfast was not included costing about  per person per day    it seemed like everyone elses was complementary and b we couldnt get tax back about  US total because technically you dont pay Canadian tax when you book through hotels  Therefore the few dollars saved didnt make it worth it    just so you know  
N => First Rate  
N => watch out Ritz  
N => Saint Amazing  
N => Hotel Le Saint Sulpice   beautiful new hotel next to Notre Dame Cathedral  
N => great deal on a conveniently located hotel friendly staff clean pack n play crib We stayed here on a  day vacation in ust   Had a nice problem free stay in a large room for no particular reason we were upgraded to a larger suite than we booked  Fully equipped kitchen was nice  housekeeping did our dishes even though I think that was our responsibility  Room was nice and spacious but not fancy  Plenty of closet space  Clean Pack N Play crib was available for our one year old although no one brought sheets  Hotel was quiet staff were extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants etc  Pizza place Il Focolaio a couple doors down was really good and had outdoor seating  French restaurant a block away Restaurant ien was good but pricier  Rooftop pool and k were small but nice to have  Valet parking was  per day  Free internet worked fine have to ask for a password at the front desk  Free breakfast included the usual fare  sometimes we skipped it  Would stay here again  
N => Largest room ever Our ior Suite  at the Square Phillips was the largest room I ever have experienced in my  years of travelling around the globe  I took  large steps from the kitchen end to the window end and almost  steps the narrow side This included bedroom living room and kitchen  Partitions arated them somewhat  Additionally comes a long isle opening to a medium sized bathroom with missing or and a walk in closet  Overall easily more than  square meters  Amazing Obviously they had some space left when transforming the office building into a hotel  Location was good though you needed ground transportation to go to the trendy latin quarter  Staff was helpful and friendly  The hotel was quiet though we had some loud neighbors baging doors Sunday early morning Just one question Who needs  oversized flat screen TVs in listening distance WiFi worked fine  
N => Ideal location but not perfect The location in downtown Montreal cannot be beaten   ideal for shopping cultural activities visits to museums and old Montreal  The rooms are certainly large with confortable beds although the or and bathrooms appear somewhat dated  Free internet access if provided to those with their own computer   otherwise at the business centre on the first floor  Breakfast is served until  and the breakfast room gets overcrowded with families vying for tables and squeezing past each other to get to the food   which is basic fare  Check in staff were OK but did not bother to explain the hotels facilities  The biggest pain was the housekeeping staff   they will even enter the room while you are at breakfast and before you are even ready for the day ahead or they will call you on the phone to ask when you are leaving  However their activities did not seem to stretch to changing the bed linen   during a week long stay this did not happen once  
N => Excellent hotel This was a fantastic hotel  We were in Montreal for the Jazz festival in early y Every thing from the rooms to location to value were great and the service was sensational complimentary breakfast was also great Highly recommended 
N => Beware   they will downgrade you because they cant get your room ready I will let the readers of Tripadvisor be the judge of our experience  We arrived at pm and were told that the room is not ready as the previous person stayed there for days yes   and it will take a little longer to clean  At around pm we were told that it will take a least another hrs to clean the room so they will offer us another one  They did not tell us at the time that it would be a downgraded room  I had booked a one bedroom suite with a sofa bed and we ended up with a studio with two double beds  We were very tired and ided to just let it go  Later that evening we ided to go out for dessert  We asked the valet to bring the car around and after waiting for minutes the valet comes back breathless to tell us that he dropped the car key down the elevator shaft  Oh well   the poor boy looked so scared that we ided to just let it go  He promised that they will have parking security retrieve the key by early morning  which they did  We braved the elements and walked to St  Catherines for a bite   we eventually bought pizza to eat in our room  We checked out the next morning and realized that they charged us for the one bedroom rate and did not even bother to give us complimentary parking for the inconvenience  I wanted to speak to the manager about the quotdowngradequot in room but one was not available  As we were on our way to Mt  Tremblant   we let that go as well  I am in the process of trying to contact management  
N => Fantastic location service rooms and rooftop pool We were very impressed by this hotel  It was within walking distance of most of the Montreal sites  The room was extremely spacious with a kitchen dining room table large bathroom and sleeping area  We loved the room We used the pool which was a perfect way to relax after walking miles in wonderful Montreal  We also used the coin laundry  Everything including the laundry was spotless We would definitely stay here again  
N => loved to stay its was a exelent hotelwe enjoyed the french culture thererooms were exelentrents for the rooms were reasonablewe stayed in the ior suite kingrooms were well furnishedkitchen were well equipedrooftop swiming pool was was amazingexercise room was well equipedlaundromat was also there hotel is in the downtown so we can see the nite life 
N => A little disappointed     o After our flight was delayed  hours we arrived at the hotel at  pm  When we tried to check in we were told we needed the credit card that we made the reservation with  Being from Australia the person that had the credit card was unreachable and so we suggested we pay for the first night so that we could arrange the other details at a later stage when we werent already exhaustedWe were made to call the person any way being told that arranging one night would cost the total of the booking a week reservation  Having no luck as they couldnt dial international numbers were were told that we would have to use the credit card number that they had on file that they wouldnt charge the room to We were told to go to the local hostel and come back the next day to try and fix the booking then  After  hours we returned to the hotel and paid cash which they then accepted and we eventually got a room  Since the first night we have had a pleasant stay and there have been no issues since but I am still a little irritated to be told to go to a hostel when they have my booking details There surely should have been some way of dealing with this situation without sending paying customers away in the middle of the night because of internal processes poor customer service 
N => Excellent hotel  My husband amp I visited this hotel over Memorial Day weekend with our  four year old children  We chose this hotel based on the great reviews on this site and we were very happy  The room was big enough to allow our little ones extra room to move about  Plus having the kitchinette and all the utensils made meals very easy  The room was spotless and well made up  The only drawback is that there was no wifi  You had to get a cable from the front desk for your laptop but since we only brought our phones we had to wait till we went out to access wifi  We all enjoyed the rooftop pool  The fitness center is quite small  The price for this hotel is great for being in downtown Montreal  There was everything we needed in close proximity  Well definitely go back the service was very friendly  
N => Best hotel I stayed in thusfar We arrived late in a rainy Montreal after a long drive from Niagara Falls  We were greeted by the friendly staff and got the keys to our roomstudio  We booked a  room appartment and when we entered the room it was bigger than booked  We were tired so got to bed and slept wonderfully  The next morning we asked about the room if there had been a mistake but the lady at the counter replied we got a free upgrade  That was a nice surprise and a first for us We now had a nice big  bedroom studio and really enjoyed it  It had a well equipped kitchen with an oven microwave stove refrigerator and a small dining table If we ever return to Montreal we are sure to stay here 
N => Perfect I stayed in this city centre hotel with my teenage son to explore Montreal  It was as reviewed on Tripadvisor very very central  We had a very spacious and comfortable room and though round the corner from the Jazz Festival we were not in the least disturbed by noise  I would be happy to recommend this hotel in the depths of Winter also due to its close proximity to the vast array of underground shopping access  We had to fly home suddenly due to a family illness and I was facilitated with an easy checkout a day early and not penalised for leaving at short notice  
N => Not perfect we might return Indoor pool is narrow rectangle and only one depth of  M  View is nice from roof  Beds are quotrigidquot and I had a time getting to sleep since I need something a bit softer  Valet parking was not optional since they took my keys when I first entered they did not mention an option  Lady at the front desk looked somewhat afraid perhaps because her english wasnt so good Dont know  Valet had to translate to her some of our conversation  Staff was friendly std room was spacious AND kitchenette  TV reception was so so  With extra cot valet parking and taxes my online quote of  US became  US in reality  Not really such a great deal just quotOKquot  
N => Great room  Great price  Excellent location  Customer service was top notch  Very reasonable price  Continental breakfast was included  Amazing room   very large high ceilings ceiling to floor windows king bed kichenette  Excellent location    minute walk to St  Catherines shopping amp restaurant district  Would highly recommend  
N => Very Nice Hotel Wonderful staff  Courteous and helpful  The room was spotless We stayed in   Everything was excellent at this hotel  Our room did not have the best of view but was convenient to old downtown Cathrine St and underground mall entrance  I will return to this hotel if traveling to Montreal again  
N => Big Rooms Great for a Family Me my husband and  kids ages  and  stayed at Le Square Phillips after reading the rave reviews on Tripadvisor com  I have to say the hotel did live up to its reviews The rooms were very spacious  In the suite we had a full kitchen which I believe comes with every room the kitchen was stocked with utensiles plates pots etc    There were  flat screen tvs a king size bed a queen size bed and a living room  The rooms also appeared to be very clean The one thing I loved about the hotel was that it was walkable to every major location and the Metro was right around the short corner  The whole time we stayed there which was  nights we only took our car out once and that was to go to Little Italy We did not use the pool but we did go up to the roof top  The pool is nice but it is smaller then it appears in teh picture  However the roof has a beautiful view with lounge chairs to use if the weather permits I found the staff to be very nice and helpful to us in planning what attractions we wanted to see All in all this was a great place to stay and not a bad price for hte space you get  
N => Huge rooms and a wonderful location If youre going to spend all of your stay in Montreal in old Montreal then you should book a hotel in old Montreal  But if you want to explore old Montreal eat in Chinatown take the subway to other parts of town go shopping or walk to Mt  Royal or McGill University Le Square Phillips is the place for you My husband two teen dhters and I spent  nights in the hotel in mid ust and really enjoyed it  We loved having so much space  It took us   minutes to walk to old Montreal depending on where exactly we were going but it was an easy walk  Chinatown which features priily Vietnamese restaurants is about  minutes away on the way to old Montreal  The closest subway stop is the McGill station which you can enter on the side of the Bay department store  My older dhter loved being so close to the major department stores and several shopping malls  We also used the kitchen one night to cook a meal that we bought at the Jean Talon ket a must seeAlthough the breakfast was not exciting it was perfectly adequate  The breakfast room was usually crowded but we always found a table within a few minutes  The valet parking worked well for us except for one time when for some reason it took  minutes to bring our car around even though the staff told us wed have the car in just  minutes  
N => Fantastic What a great hotel The location was perfect   close to old Montreal and also near the center of town  Our room was spotlessly clean tastefully orated quiet and abundantly comfortable  The hotel made our stay in Montreal perfect  Regretfully we tried to stay an extra day at the end of our trip but were not able to get a reservation for another day  
N => Central Location Within a  mile walking distance from all downtown and Old Montreal  Was on a family trip with small child so this was important  Hotel arranged a babysitter for two nights and it went well Not many restaurantsbars in immediate vicinity but found a lot of options in Old Montreal  When walking to Old Montreal be prepared to walk back up hill the whole way Had a  bed suite which was larger than expected est  sq ft with  flat screen tvs and independent climate control in each bedroom and suite area  Staff was friendly and helpful with ent recommendations on places to eat  
N => Luxurious and top notch staff During a  week vacation in Quebec this was the best of the hotels we stayed at  Location was very convenient in Downtown just a block from St  Catherine St  and the Jazz Festival be a  minute walk to the Old Montreal area  Service was excellent very solicitous from the front desk to the concierges to the bellhops  The room was very spacious and comfortable kitchen pretty equipped  Breakfast included was buffet and had plenty of options waffles croissants breads cereal fruit etc  Valet parking was very convenient  Rooftop indoor heated pool was a hit with our kids  Overall a home run  
N => Huge room This hotel was in a good location very close to a big underground shopping centre and a few blocks from the train station The room was very large with a dining table and kitchen which made in room dining a pleasure usually we are eating on the bed andor a small desk  We had a large king sized bed which we found quite comfortable The continental breakfast room was very convenient as we didnt have to go hunting for places to eat first thing in the morning  although I did wish they had soy milk as an option  One enterprising visitor had brought her own We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again if we go back in summer  
N => Best hotel stay ever everything that was on the hotel website was truethe hotel was amazingthe staff was great and helpduleverything was near the hotel food superket etcthe pool and sunk are amazing breakfats was greati loved my stay there   we got the family suite and  of us slept there  but u can defs sneak  or  more in there  
N => As good as everyone says We paid a little extra to have a two bedroom executive suite for a long weekend with our two teenage sons  The room was amazing over  sq feet  We all had plenty of space to chill  Great location  Concierge at night was not as good as I expected but the daytime staff was great  
N => Great room HUGE we arrived after a very stressful day of driving to and from the Presidents Cup golf match  Once we arrived we were greated warmly and in a very proffessional manner  When we opened the door to our room we suprised to see a long hallway leading to another room  As we walked down the hall way we notice the huge bathroom closet and then we walked into the room  Full kitchen area living room with pullout couch and TV then the bedroom  In total and I messured the room counting hallway was over  sq  feet  Almost the size of my home  Clean with many windows looking over the city it was by far and away one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in  Almost too much for the two of us  I have been to many hotels but this room was a first  The location is very close to everything downtown and a short cab ride to anywhere else worth going  Would strongly recommend this hotel esp  for families  I will be back again  
N => Great location great room great service As most other reviewers have noted this place deserves its   rating  Its conveniently located about  a block from St  Catherine St  Rue St  Catherine and within walking distance of just about every where  We walked to Rue St  Catherine and all the shops around there the McGill Metro station only had to take the metro once   when we went out to the Biodome Rue Peel Rue Crescent   and even down to Old Montreal  We stayed in the smallest room   the king studio   and it was huge  It had a full kitchen   including a dishwasher  And the bathroom was gorgeous   clearly newly reated and pristine The staff was also excellent  They helped us get a pm reservation at great nearby French restaurant Restaurant ien when it was already pm on Saturday nightMy only teeny weeny wish was that the pool would have been heated or that they had a hot tub  But then again there are better things to do in Montreal than soak in a hot tub 
N => Home from home We spent  nights at the Square Phillips and found it to be as good as the reviews on TripAdvisor suggested  We had so much space in our suite we were rattling around It was almost too big  Whilst the suite was only modestly furnished it had absolutely everything youd need and was extremely quiet The bed was comfortable and the bathroom offered lavish amounts of hot water at all times  The Internet access was very helpful and the staff were a little cool but basically helpful  The location is interesting it is worth walking up Blvd St Catherine for a mile or two to find an amazing choice of restaurants  Breakfast was perfectly adequate but not exciting  We would unhesitatingly recommend Square Phillips but it does lend itself to a longer stay and is not particularly atmospheric or romantic  
N => Phenomenal Experience I couldnt wait to get home to write a glowing review of Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites in Montreal  Reviews that other travelers had posted on Trip Advisor tipped me off that this would be a good experience but it exceeded all expectations  My family of  spouse  teens stayed in a spectacular  bedroom suite that lacked only a half bath in addition to the full bath to fall short of perfect  Every member of staff that we encountered was exceptionally courteous happy and helpful  The location is terrific   within a brisk  minute walk of nearly everything worth seeing and doing in downtown Montreal  Be sure to eat at Restauant ien a block from the hotel 
N => a well kept secret We stayed for  days from y      in a  beds studio  When we first arrived I forgot about their valet parking feature and since we were heading right out we didnt want the valet to park the van and told him we would only be checking in unload and be gone again  He warned us that if we took longer than  minutes then the hotel wouldnt be responsible for the parking ticket  Hm   We also told him that we would park the van ourselves since we had things we needed to clear out of the van  Instead of telling us that its valet parking only he told us the hotel parkades full and we would have to park our van  blocks away in another parking lot in the rain By that time I was not too fond of that guy Fortunately it was all explained to us at the front desk  We did put them to work though since we were in and out with our van on most days  Oh well valet service for  day parking  A very good deal When we arrived in the room we found a wine cork and crumbs under the round table for   How the housekeeping missed that was beyond me since it was the first thing we spotted  That was cleaned up the next day when I left the housekeeping a note and we never had anymore problem after that  We also had an issue with the TVremote when we tried to access the movie channel but that was taken care of promptly when the handyman was sent up  Impressive All in all we enjoyed our stay there and the continental breakfast was more than adequate  The staffs at the front desk were friendly and helpful  Now if the valet guys would just smile If anyone going to Montreal looking for a jazz jam Don t  Its nepotism at its worst  Our  yr son one of the top young jazz pianists in our city wanted to jam with the locals there so he located a jazz club with open stagejam night  On our last night instead of spending it with our dhter we went down to Upstairs jazz club on Rue MacKay with our son for the jam night  We were the first to arrive before the band the first to put his name down to jam and yet the drummer put all his friends up there  songs each    minutepiece and ignored this young kid from out of town  The sad part was my son even sat and chatted with the band so they knew he was from out of town  He was told as late as midnight  hr before the close of the jam that he would have a chance to go on  Well he never got called  We contacted the establishment and voiced our concerns but the email was ignored  Go to House of Jazz on Kennedy and Aylmer  A way nicer and more established jazz club  
N => Great place to stay in Montreal We stayed in Square Phillip for  nights in early   Very good location   we walked to the old city park on Mont Royal Museum of Fine Arts and Latin Quarter  Excellent room we stayed in the family suite very clean spacious and convenient  We didnt use a kitchen well  be fridge but I always prefer to stay in a place equipped with a kitchen especially when travelling with kids so it was a plus for us  Breakfast was very simple but it was OK for us  However it  be a good idea to opt instead for a good patisserie  boulangerie  Nice swimming pool and excercise room on the roof  It was not a high season so we were the only ones swimming in the pool and kids had plenty of room to horse around  Overall this hotel deserves the number one rating on TA  
N => Very Nice We stayed here for one night on our weekend trip to Montreal  The staff was very friendly the concierge helpful in getting us a restaurant reservation and the room was very spacious Studio with King bed  We didnt use the kitchen in the room but it was a very nice addition especially if you plan on staying a few days  We spent most of our time in Old Montreal which was a good   minute walk  So if you know you will spend alot of time there you  want to take a taxi or find a hotel in old montreal  Otherwise this hotel is right in downtown and very close to all the shopping and restaurants in downtown Overall a very enjoyable hotel experience  
N => A hotel for neat freaks This hotel was the cleanest we have ever stayed in  It was so clean that even I a confessed neat freak failed to find a hair a stain or a speck of dust  The staff was welcoming and the location was very good in downtown although not charming  Neither are the rooms  They are modern and efficient and very comfortable but they dont exude any kind of French flair But that is not a fault of the hotel  We actually found that much of Montreal lacked a bit of the expected charm and we realized that in our minds we had built it up to be more Old Worldly than reality supports  Its a welcoming and very youthful city but its not Paris by any stretch So this hotel reflects the style of the town quite perfectly All in all a very good value  
N => Not so wonderful I was really surprised to see so many people loving this hotel  The rooms have no view the or is very cold and basic looking with IKEA syle furniture  The only restaurant in the near by area is a Burger King  I have to say I was really disappointed  No pool and no restaurant  This would be a great hotel if it was compared to a  or  star hotel  Never again  Tuesday I checked into anther hotel that has a lot more star serviceBelinda 
N => Insulting and incompetent customer service Without a doubt the most surreally disrespectful customer service I have ever experienced in a hotel After I returned from my stay I noticed an extra unidentifiable charge on my credit card from the hotel  I called to inquire I was told by the receptionist that it was a charge for the bathrobe quotI tookquot  When I explained to her there was no bathrobe in the room to begin with and that I did not in fact take one home her answer was quotWe keep a tight inventory so actually what you tell me is impossible quot Direct quote  No other way to interpret that than calling me a liar  The next day the manager called me  I told him the story and that I was quite upset with the way the receptionist had spoken to me  Instead of apologizing or immediately offering to fix the problem he too echoed the quotwe always check so you must be wrongquot accusation going as far as to say that they had quotproofquot from their housekeepers records that in fact the bathrobe had been placed in the room but that today he quotfelt sorryquot for me so he would give me credit  At this point I went ballistic for here was a manager now telling me that he too believed his seemingly infallible records over a paying guest who has spent over  at the hotel over the past year and that somehow I deserved pity rather than an apology  He then called ME disrespectful  Imagine that I would highly recommend visitors to Montreal to avoid the Square Phillips unless you want to find yourself accused of something you didn t do and spending valuable time trying to receive fair treatment from a staff clearly unable to give it  Ruined my trip for sure  
N => Great deal in downtown Montreal  I was in Montreal moving yet again one of my children attending university there  To make it easier on ourselves we get a hotel room once done to have a shower walk to dinner get a good nights sleep and generally chill  This time we ided to try something right downtown  The hotel has a great location of off St  Catherines St  in the core of downtown Montreal  The room was very spacious and clean  The staff pleasant and courteous  It was a nice to place to retreat to after a hard day moving  It is good value for money  I would definitely recommend it to Montreal visitors business or pleasure and will of course be using again next time it moving time  
N => Exceeded Our Expectations We were planning my th birthday trip to Montreal when I saw a mention of this hotel in a TripAdvisor email newletter  I checked it out every which way I could because its price   U S  seemed too good to be true  Also checked out what seemed to be comparable hotels    none compared  I called the hotel directly and made our reservations for a studio with kitchenette  We took the scenic Amtrak train from Saratoga Springs and arrived after dark in the rain to Montreals Gare Centrale  On the phone the reservation clerk had said the train station was only four blocks away  We took an inexpensive cab ride during which the cab driver called Le Square Phillips quota wonderful hotel quot I thought really cab drivers know about this hotel The entrance looked much more upscale than we imagined    and this was just the beginning  Everything from the staff to the complimentary continental breakfast to the lap pool with exercise room were perfect  Our studio included a complete eat in kitchen and so much square footage we felt like we could live there  Whats more this dream living space was within walking distance of just about everything including Zia a little Italian restaurant right off the lobby and Le Grand Comptoir our favorite French bistro ever  This is a great hotel from which to explore a great city  Magnigfique 
N => ordinary not extraordinary Ive been to Montreal  or  times and this time I stayed   Square phillips as a last minute reservation since all the other hotels I wanted were booked solid  Who knew it was the Liberal convention  I have previously stayed in a BampB and dorm  This hotel was worse than any of them I dont want to give this hotel a bad rating especially after all the great reviews but be my expectations were too high  I couldnt give it a   rating even if I wanted to since it wasnt even close to a   hotel I want to give this a   but I dont want my bad experience to reflect on the hotel   Ill try to keep this non biased PROSgreat location close to shoppingfriendly receptionisthuge roomcleangreat breakfast lots to choose fromgood value for   But with the cons I wouldnt pay to go back CONS  uncomfortable bedpillows  Too hard and too flat   busy concierges we were always waiting    they werent as helpful as they shouldve beenexpected them to be   horrible soundproofing  this was my bad experience as we were awakened twice once at midnight and from  am from partying neighbours  We made a noise complaint but it didnt do anything  The doors slammed SOOO LOUD  I made sure in the morning I returned the favour by cranking up a French cartoon with high pitched character voices prank called the room and checked out with the radio alarm buzzer on full blast I cant imagine what it would be like in the summer with more partyers  I will definitely rethink hotels and aim for BampBs next time  If youre ok with the possibility of noise I think this will be a good choice especially for families  
N => Good Hotel but Make sure you read the room descriptions carefully  The hotel was good  The continental breakfast is lousy a sure waste of time and money  Make sure when making your reservation you understand a  Bedroom Family Suite is only  inclosed bedroom and  room in an alcove out in the open  We thought we reserved a  Bedroom suite that had two erate rooms  We were informed at check in that this was extra money and we did not reserve the correct room type  They nicely accomodated us with   Bedroom rooms  
N => Highly Recommended with Spacious Rooms Great Location and Fantastic Service  My husband and I along with our one year old son stayed at Le Square Phillips for three nights in ember   The hotel staff was fantastic  The room was large roomy and very clean  I arrived at the hotel at am after flying on an all night flight from Victoria  I had emailed ahead of time to let staff know when I would be arriving in Montreal  I was hoping to check in early as I knew Id be exhausted and my husband would not be arriving until later in the day  When I arrived at the hotel the staff informed me that because my room wasnt ready they were upgrading us to a larger suite  It was incredible What a gift The free continental breakfast was delicious  Lots of choices such as fruit cereal toast bagels muffins juice milk coffee etc    Just what we needed to start off our day without having to go out and buy a costly restaurant breakfast The location was great  Right downtown  Lots of great shopping and only a quick walk to Old Montreal which we were really excited to explore  I would definitely stay at this hotel again and cant wait to go back to Montreal  
N => Two thumbs up We ided to reserve a room at Le Square Phillips hotel based on all of the great reviews we read on trip advisor and we were not dissapointed  Our hotel room was immaculate   spacious clean and well equipped with dishes cutlery etc  The location was also great   within walking distance to the metro as well as all of the action on St Catherines  We would definately stay there again 
N => Close to LasikMD offices This hotel was great My family came with me when I was having LASIK surgery  The LASIKMD office was an easy  minute walk away  The location was also great for public transportation shopping and restaurants Our hotel room was large and included a complete kitchen  The bed was comfortable and even the pull out sofa was comfortable for the kids  The pool was small but perfect for my two kids to swim in for hours  The staff were friendly and helpful  I would definitely stay at this hotel if I were to go to Montreal again  
N => make this your first choice We booked a three day stay at this hotel on the spur of the moment  My wife two children and I had gone to Vermont skiing and the last day of snow was not that great  We ided to leave our hotel a few days early and go to Montreal  We hadnt visited Canada before  I have a hilton honours card and usually use this chain if I can  Luckily before making a reservationI was able to access the trip advisor website which gave poor reviews of the Hilton but excellent reviews of the le Square Philips apartments  Everything that you have read in the reviews of this hotel is true  This really is THE place to stay if youre in Montreal  The suites are simply huge  This was a real bonus after  days in a fairly small and basic skiing hotel  The rooms are not only large but well appointed and you just have everything you need  We didnt use the pool or the washer but it was good to know they were there  Staff are very nice and helpful and instantly switch to English Well remember our short stay for a long time  
N => Excellent hotel I loved this hotel  The staff were so helpful and did everything in there power to make our stay a special one  My kids really enjoyed it  The restaurant on the ground floor was excellent  If I was going to Montreal again I would stay here  
N => Magnifique We just returned from Spring Break and spent two nights here based on trip advisor reviews  We were not disappointed We had a  bedroom suite for our family and it was fabulous Plenty of space to spread out and very clean  The service personnel were great  Very helpful on siteseeing restaurant reservations valet etc  Would make it my first choice in Montreal 
N => Wow This hotel was everything that the reviews said it was  Unbelievably clean huge space good service amp at a good price  The kids loved the pool amp it was nice to have breakfast included  Every hotel should take some tips from this place   I wish they had a location in every major city  
N => Bigger than my sisters apartment Date uary  Reviewer Aileen Cleveland OhioIt was the biggest room Ive ever stayed in with tall ceilings and more square footage than my sisers co op in Manhattan   and for a GREAT price Ask for the corner rooms which are huge we stayed in    It is very centrally located walkable to Old Town and the Latin Quarter for those in comfortable shoes  Not far at all from Chinatown even closer to lots of shopping  I love the modern simple but not austere style  Generous continental breakfast  Full kitchen deli downstairs in the storefront  No spa services or room service  Treadmill was out of order but did enough walking in the city  Staff was very friendly and helpful When I go back to Montreal hopefully soon I will go back again and again to Le Square Phillips  
N => Le Square was superb I booked this hotel on the basis of other reviews on this site and it did not disappoint  We only stayed one night but wished we could have stayed longer  Our room was massive compared to the usual english hotels we have and had a kitchen with full size cooker and fridge and a dining table  None of your usual mini fridge and  ring cooker  I only wished we had been here longer to make use of it Location of hotel could not have been better just behind The Bay and near the Eaton centre and valet parking was a great treat not having to worry about where to park your car A great place to stay 
N => A great suprise When I was looking for a hotel in Montreal I had a hard time with all the choices and high prices  After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I found Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites  I was unsure of the hotel I could not find it in any books magazines or other web sites  It was not a mistake  My wife is not one to stay in a run down hotel  This hotel fit her standards  It was a bit tricky to find  I did valet park which was    There is a small shop in the lobby that has everything you need  The roof top pool has a great view  I booked the standard room from the internet which had a full kitchen  Breakfast was put out in the moring on the second floor and had a ent assortment of foods  Its in the heart of the city where you can walk anywhere  This is a recommend hotel  
N => Exceeded My Expectations We needed a comfortable hotel to stay for five days with my two sons  and   The two bedroom suite was more then adequate  I often stay at the Queen E when I come to Montreal on my own but not anymore  I have found a new favourite with Le Square Phillips  
N => Least expensive Great hotel in Montreal Since I could hardly afford the other high ranked hotels in Montreal I tried Le Square Phillips Hotel amp Suites and I could hardly imagine a much better experience  Though they have valet parking I hate valet parkinging   I like to have easy access to my car at all times   the hotel is located right next to a huge outdoor parking lot where I was able to see my car everytime I walked out of the hotel yes The rooms were large with a fully equipped kitchen  And the location was perfect for us   walking distance to great department stores   Old Montreal China Town Place De Arts Museums   and its tucked away on a lightly traveled side street  Even my Montreal resident friend was unaware that this hotel existed  My only quibble   the foam rubber pillows are horrible  Next time Ill bring my own  And there will be a next time  Until I can afford  a night this will be my choice hotel in Montreal  
N => Stop looking I just came back from Montreal and I chose to stay at Square Phillips hotel based on reviews found on TripAdvisor  I can say now all these positive comments were true  This is probably the best  star hotel in Montreal  I had a Studio which is the smallest room at this hotel but it was huge  The room was very clean  The service was great  The location was perfect really in the center of downtown Montreal  The price was right  I have been in many hotels in Montreal this was my best experience by far  Just stop looking and reserve at this hotel you will not regret it  
N => Just as described It is so refreshing to find something   anything that you purchase    to be as good or in this case   better than advertised  I would agree with the prior postings Le Hotel Square Phillips was an excellent choice for my family of   children under  exploring beautiful Montreal  I would recommend it without reservation  
N => Worth staying at Le Square Phillips We arrived early during the day and since we did not request for an early check in we werent expecting to have our room ready until at least PM  However while I was asking where we could park our car while awaiting check in they got our room ready at  AM   This allowed us to settle down before heading for the grocery store for supplies  Very helpful staff  The description of huge and spacious rooms you find in this forum is not at all exaggerated The  bedroom we stayed in was roomy spotless and housekeeping came everyday we stayed for  nights to cleanup and replenish supplies  If you intend to cook in your room be reminded that this is not a timeshare unit and therefore is not as well equipped i e  paper towels were not provided there only is the most basic cooking utensilspansbowls etc  Plates cups glasses forks spoons knives were sufficient The fitness room was okay but we found the pool really small for a hotel this size  The size must have been around  feet wide by  feet long and allowed a maximum of  bathers  Cant complain about the breakfast   simple but very generous in quantity  I saw some guests filling up their tray to take up to their rooms evenAll in all we had a wonderful time at Le Square Phillips and would definitely stay here again in our next trip to Montreal  
N => Huge suites We were staying in a  room suite it was huge more like a house  Spotless and very comfortable  The staff were very friendly and efficient nothing seemed to much trouble even when my wife dropped a glass in the bathroom at midnight they came and cleared up but why no plastic tumbler in the bathroomBreakfast was ok cereal toast muffins bagals and fruit  
N => Wonderful This  be one of the best places weve ever stayed  Not because of beauty but because of comfort great beds cleanliness incredible quiet size of rooms location helpful staff and price  Very nice little breakfast  I would never have known about this hotel without Trip Advisor and ided to give it a try  We were definitely not disappointed We could easily walk to Old Montreal and since the hotel is located downtown we also went to check out the huge shopping areas a block from the hotel  Excellent restaurants in the area some way too expensive but at least worth the money  This old building was completely reated only  years ago and its like brand new  Its considered an quotapartment hotel  We were in a studio with  Q beds in a huge room  We didnt use the kitchen but it was complete  The whole stay was great 
N => Cant be beat This was our third stay in the past year and we will be back again  The rooms staff location etc  are as wonderful as previously reviewed  An important aspect of our choosing a hotel in downtown Montreal is the parking  Our dhter is a student at McGill and we were there to bring her home at the end of the winter term  Needless to say our SUV was packed to the roof  When we returned from the residence hall after loading in the rain we asked if wed be able to quotrearrangequot things while parked in the parking quotgaragequot  The staff couldnt have been more helpful  We were already aware parking was inside on the second floor  When we made the request we were told that area was full and they were using their off site valet parking on the next block  We were not aware there was more than one location  Room was made for our car right inside the second floor access and we were able unpack and repack at our leisure out of the rain  We have also stayed at the Holiday Inn on Sherbrooke which offers indoor valet parking but found the rooms to be lacking  Looking forward to returning for next term 
N => Terrific hotel Spent two nights there in ruary   The largest hotel room I have ever stayed in   very elegant and comfortable  Outstanding location  I have no hesitations in recommending this hotel to anyone going to Montreal  
N => A fantastic hotel My boyfriend and I just returned from a two night stay at Le Square Phillips t     It was an excellent stay  The hotel was beautiful and the price was really greatespecially compared to other hotels in the area  I booked the hotel based on the reviews on this site and the fact that it was so affordable  I only wish we were there for a longer period of time The hotel would be great for extended stays  The room was huge and very clean  The staff was very friendly and told us to ask them if we had any questions at all about Montreal it was our first time there  There was also plenty of information in the lobby for tourists to flip through  The breakfast was good and there was lots to choose from  The location was perfect  We walked everywhere we wanted to go or took the Metro which is also close by  Im sure everything Ive mentioned here has already been mentioned by others but I really did love this hotel  I recommend it to anyone and will be staying there again if we return to Montreal in the future  
N => Overall pleasant but a few glitches Booked a room based on all the positive reviews  I called travelocity a week before arrival to confirm room details parking etc   all is good  Upon check in at pm we were told our room was not ready and we could not have a non smoking room as we asked for when we made the reservation last   After I mentioned I would be happy to call travelocity to confirm the non smoking room request as well as the fact that check in is anytime after pm an available non smoking room was found for us   The room was super  spacious clean well lit firm beds  The only issue that made our stay a bit unpleasant was the noise in the hallways late at night  The room doors are not well soundproofed and we were awoken all  nights by nighttime revelers returning to their rooms   A suggestion for those arriving by car  There is a spacious safe outdoor parking lot next to the hotel that charges only day  A bargain compared to the day the hotel charges  
N => Great stay Ive just arrived home after spending nine nights at Le Square Phillips Hotel based solely on the recommendations on this website  I wasnt disappointed at all  Its everything that everyone has said that it is Room quality   exceptional  Location   superb  Staff   very friendly  I will not hesitate to recommend this establishment to anyone nor will I think twice before booking there again   soonWe stayed in a one bedroom which in hindsight was probably too big for just two of us  I think next time well go with a simple studio as it sounds as though the space there is more than ample  Needless to say the one bedroom proved more than spacious  The location is second to none in my opinion  It was a short walk to either the McGill or Square Victoria Metro stops  There was more shopping within a short walking distance of the hotel than one could imagine  And food   ah yes food  Of the nine days that I was in town I had one bad meal and that was at a quottavernquot in Vieux Montreal   I should have known better  Otherwise it was dining heaven  And there are incredible eating opportunities close to the hotel including the great pizza restaurant between the hotel and Ste Catherine If youre trying to ide whether to stay here or not take the plunge  You wont regret it  Definitely feel free to contact me if you have any questions   Id love to help  Montreal was a great visit 
N => Based on Reviews Even tho I have not stayed there yet I will be in tember  I have however been in touch with them and they have answered all my questions very very promptly amp personally  Not like a large chain where you get a form reply   days later that doesnt answer the question and is not from anyone particular that is if you get a response at all Cant wait to stay at this hotel due to all the great reviews  which is why I chose this hotel Thanks 
N => fantastic quick stay one night best hotel weve ever stayed at  was able to accomodate five people in one room  loved everything about it  extremely clean very close to everything  reasonably priced   
N => What an experience Le Square Philllips was an exciting place to stay you feel like you are right at home with the kind staff that are there for your every need  It was so close to we wanted to do from the underground malls to the nite life that is so well talked about  We will definately be staying there again  
N => THe best hotel we have stayed at My wife and I spent nights at Le Sqaure Phillips hotel in Montreal and we were more than pleased with the hotel and our room WE stayed in a ior suite and it was enormous not to mention beautiful The location was without doubt close to everything downtown WE were at the doorstep to Ste Catherine street and just minutes walk to the Bell centremin walkChinatownmin walkand Old montrealmin walk  THe subway was practically across the street from which you can access the underground pathways WE were very pleased with our stay and the staff were very friendly THis hotel has to be the best kept secret in all of Montreal and the price was very reasonable A suite such as ours would have cost us hundreds of dollars more at othere world class hotels I highly recommend to anyone  
N => Very Pleased My husband and I went to Montreal to celebrate his th birthday  From reading reviews posted here we chose the Le Square Phillips Hotel and Suites  It lived up to all the great reviews  It was clean spacious well located and friendly  They went out of their way to help us  A great place to stay  We also ate at Gibbys thanks to seeing it recommended here  It was also great  Thank you for all the helpful information  
N => The ONLY place to stay in Montreal  
N => Dont Miss This  
N => What a FIND   
N => A real find  
N => Super Clean   
N => Luxurious Upscale Le Square Phillips Exceeds All Expectations

N => El mejor Hotel en el que me he alojado  
N => still underconstruction We stayed Le Westin Montreal on  and   We were really looking forward to staying at your place because we heard that this hotel place is bland new and we really enjoyed stay at Westin hotel when we lived in Japan  However we had a miserable night at Le Westin Montreal  First after we checked in a porter lost my wifes jacket while he brought our baggage to our room but he never admit that and claimed that she had left it in the car  My wife went to quotlost and foundquot by herself and found it  It turned out that the porter had dropped her jacket on the hallway and somebody had found it  Second this hotel is still under construction  There were tons of tools everywhere  The pool looked good but the changing room was not ready  no shower and no locker there  The water was so cold and we couldnt stay there more than  minutes Third and most importantly the service was awful  We came back from the pool to our room shivering with cold and we wanted to take a shower in our room but we could find bath towels  I asked room service to bring them but they never came  I had to make a call to room service three times we had to wait for hrs To make it worse no hot water came out So I send an email and complained and I got auto email reply saying quotwe will give you extra starwood points for your inconveniencequot  We have ided never ever choose Westin for our next trip  
N => Great Service Response to problems We just stayed at the Westin and the bed was fabulous  We had a few service blips but each time the hotel staff handled everything extremely well  They definitely have some kinks to work out but I feel in time it should be a fabulous hotel  Make sure to eat at the hotel restaurant the Gazette for dinner  We had a fabulously delicious dinner  The appetizer of mushrooms with polenta was excellent  
N => Worse Valet Service Ever Missing soap missing cup missing bathrobe the room has strange loud cracking sound that was irritating when trying to sleep but most of all   the valet service you pay  dollars a night and you expect some quality valet service   but dont expect that here   first day    minutes   okay   acceptable   nd day    minutes    alright pushing it    rd day    hour and  minutes to get my car even if they pay me  dollars to park my car with them I wouldnt  Not to mention the last day of my stay   all elevators had broken down   so we had to wait forever for the employee elevator  and then i had to deal with the  hour and a half wait for my car    STAY AWAY if you need to park your car  
N => The Westin Hotel on St  Antoine We stayed in a suite in this hotel for  days  It was the worst hotel experience we have ever had in Montreal More importantly none of our problems were fixed and an extensive letter to the manager was totally ignored The lobby was consistently full of unhappy customers with problems  There was never adequate desk staff to deal with them e g  it took  minutes to get our key reprogrammed after we could not get into our room Avoid this place like the plague  
N => This was my first impression of Montreal and I was ready to leave upon arrival  I arrived with my husband after a  hour drive  We arrived an hour or so after check in so it wasnt that busy  However there was no one around when we pulled up to the hotel  After waiting a couple of minutes I went to the front desk to check in while my husband unloaded the car  He joined me at the check in desk with our luggage in tow and no one offered to help us with it  The clerk at the desk was not friendly at all in fact he was actually quite cold  I found this very strange because even though I was tired from the drive I greeted him in French and with a smile  I found out upon check in that Expedia booked the wrong package  I was on the phone with Expedia Customer Care while they phoned the hotel to request an upgrade  They were told that there were no upgrades available but minutes after I hung up the phone another clerk upgraded a package for someone else checking in after us We ided to go to our room and to our horror the room overlooked the back and roof of office buildings  We once again attempted a room change to no avail  We were literally ready to just leave and go elsewhere but stayed because the room was pre paid  We only found the consierge once but we did find a lovely young lady from the Sales Department who saved the trip for us by giving us dinner suggestions and just greeting us everytime that she sa us with a smile  The hotels advantages are the covered entrance and its proximity to everything in Old Montreal  We did not take the car out even once The room despite the horrific view was clean and the or was very Asian inspired with realxing color choices  Construction was complete so we didnt encounter any construction noise or zones but the Spa was not yet opened which we knew in advance  The staff must improve their customer service or this hotels elegant Zen like environment will not be able to sustain it  
N => Was expecting more from a Westin We ided to stay here bc this hotel was only  months old  Typically new hotels are very clean and everything seemed a little nicer  Even though the hotel was open construction was not complete  The pool was still being worked on  So if you want to go to the pool they tell you to use the pool at the InterContinental next door as they are sharing a pool until the Westin s pool is done  We noticed that even though it was only a few months old hardware for the dresser was missing  Also the hotel maintenance crew insisted on coming in when the  do not disturb  sign was posted on the door to take a look at broken bathroom door which was not reported by us does this mean they put us in a room knowingly with a broken shower door  The hotel also makes the bed with  thick down comforters it took us  nights to figure this out which is probably useful during the cold winters  However our stay was in y we were sweating every night with the temperature    degrees Ferenheit  We finally ided put one of the comforters on the floorThere are some pluses to this hotel it is very convenient   only  blocks to Rue St  Paul the heart of old Montreal and the Notre Dame Church  There are tons of great eateries near by and a short walk to metro The poor rating is because I expected a new Westin to be better  I would only recommend this hotel if they have better service amp completed their construction  Otherwise stay elsewhere  
N => The service was fantastic but this hotel is missing a few things Overall I enjoyed my stay  The entire staff was the most friendliest and courteous bunch  from the valet to the front desk  Getting our car out of the parking garage was very easy each morning  We called the front desk and made them aware of the time we needed the car and it was down by the valet stand each time  The linens on the bed was fabulous   soft comfy and to die for  However we were missing a refrigerator in our room but we had the ice maker across the hall  The pool area was left to be desired on the th floor  It was rather small and none of them were heated so it was a bit cold in the beginning  But we did enjoy that everything was so new  
N => Potential but just not ready When we arrived after our  hour drive we pulled up to where we thought the valet should be in front of the hotel  We didnt find one so we continued to an area where it looked like the parking lot was only to find I almost slammed into a circular construction site  After  minutes of trying to get out because there wasn t a U Turn available my hubby had to drive the car out while I stayed outside and directed  No one came out to help We told the hotel this twice and even after  nights of stay they still didnt put up a sign to warn guests  I heard a couple of folks did the same thing from other guests  We went to the front office only to find our room wasnt ready even after I called twice to confirm  They asked us to join the happy hour on the rd floor where wine and cheese were being given  I asked them where the pool was after confirming w a SPG rep  and they told me it wont be opened until fall  I was pretty pissed off and the parking space about this but up we went they told us we can cab it for free to the Sheraton  After pouring a glass of wine and beginning to RELAX we were approached by a server telling us we quotover pouredquot what was our half glasses of wine  We were mortified as other guests were staring at us so we moved Finally our room was ready we were upgraded and we found it nice but not completed  The club room usually is the best at any SPG property but this looked like a standard  The drawer s knobs were missing and the hallway lights electrical wires were hanging down  I told my husband forget it lets just go work out  The gyms restrooms were not even competed there were black curtains everywhere and the carpet wasnt installed correctly  There was no water and  guests when we arrived said they called twice  We gave up on that and went back up to get dressed and to ask the concierge where we should go  They really had no clue but we were told to make sure to come back to the Club Room happy hour not the bar one for the club room guests  When we did trek all the way back making sure not to miss it you will not believe that it was closed  No warning sign or anything  We called and they told us that staff member was sick On the nd day while I was waiting for my hubby to come down he got stuck in the elevator which only  were working  When we got back later none were working and we had to use the freight elevator to go up and down they told us they would call the guests when the elevator was working  We never got that call  I called SPG to let them this is a safety concern and to also inform them on what was going on with the hotel  We were filed a report but our stay was already ruined  Again no water in the gym had to call twice  We were also being stared at by the servers at the bar I think they thought we were going to pour another glass of wine Way to treat gold and platinum guests They hotel staff as kind and sweet as they were just seemed to be lost  The concierge really had no idea where to send us on all  nights so I went on the internet to check w TA this was a last minute trip  The staff just kept apologizing for everything that was happening SPG even had the manager call us and speak with us about our stay  By the last night it was too late  We ided to go to Montreal for anniversary and I have to say I think not having an amazing time had a lot to do with the frustrations of the hotel  We just never knew what was going to go wrong when we got back  I would stay here again but not for some time and making sure with trip advisor reviewers that it is ready  The staff especially the manager Vincent tried their absolute best to make things right but it just didnt make up for things  The hotel is beautiful and has A LOT of potential but for the Westin brand and the price try elsewhere and try it next year when all the kinks are out  
N => Not good I had mixed feelings about booking in a new hotel   but got a good rate so ided to go for it  As it turns out I should have listened to that inner voice Stayed the first few days of y   pulled up and couldnt locate a valet lobby area deserted finally found one person to check us in  Agree with previous reviewer that entire hotel very corporate and generic yet if you were the events planner for your company I would be very nervous about booking a conference here   at least for several months until they finish the place  Room was nice flat screen etc  Didnt bring the laptop so no idea on the wifi Heavenly Bed is great bathroom nice but nothing too special what is the point of the double headed shower we had a nice view from the st floor to the river  Room was tight however not terribly spacious and no local area information maps etc    the stuff you usually find on the desk  We were not upset about the pool as I knew it was not complete   they do say that on the website someplace I believe  Good location for walking access to subway etc  Right next door to Embassy Suites and Intercontinental Elevators consistently out of service  No water one night from    am they did announce it in advance We had a club room and the club was a joke First of all this is a new hotel so why did they build such a small club area It will be very crowded up there whenif this hotel ever starts filling up the club floors  Worst of all was the supply of fooddrink   the reason most people pay extra for this amenity  Out of bottled water entirely for the first two days and although we dont drink soda noticed it didnt seem to be restocked very often either  Breakfast they were constantly out of food to the point where it became comical  for instance no breadbagels but lovely little salmon rolls with nothing to put them on then bread to toast and little pastries but no knives or plates   I used the end of a spoon to spread butter and we ate off napkins  We were getting very creative but by the third morning ided to go out for breakfast Eggspectations is right around the corner  Room coffee was awful   Starbucks in a cup that you see everywhere now and it just doesnt brew right  The kicker was the morning we ided to go out to breakfast I thought I could grab a cup of coffee from the lounge first but they were out of coffee  At am  On a Saturday morning  Finally went down to the restaurant always an adventure as typically only one of three elevators was working during our stay and they gave me some  The poor guy working the club lounge was very nice and very harried   he was wearing a suit and had to act as concierge and waitress not a good combination  Trying to sit at a desk and help people then coming in and cleaning up the sticky mess on the tables   they need two people up there  Club room itself seemed nothing special   they still wanted   for the bottle of water  No minifridge or minibar at all   a nice big empty cabinet under the TV though where it  one day go   when they finish the hotel Baseboard moldings had fallen off all the walls on the st floor where we stayed and they laid there for the  days we were there  No construction noise on our floor but we were second from the top  Club floors are   I think Drinks in the bar   the bartender was very nice but of course it was hotel pricey  Didnt eat in the restaurant but it looked a bit disorganized like the whole place when we peeked in at breakfast The reason we werent too unhappy No  Montreal is fantastic Happy just to be there  No  We had the quotPay Your Agequot promotion so the last two nights were    lets just say I was born before  so less than  per night which is about the right price for this hotel  Of course bill was wrong at checkout but they cheerfully corrected it  Everyone we overheard checking in or out had complaintsproblemsissues  Random comments on the hallway in the elevator quotTrainwreckquot quotWhat a Nightequot  However   EVERY employee we met was doing their best and very friendly   not their fault  I give the Service   because of the overall lack of oversight not because of the individuals we met  WHERE is Starwood senior management Someone from corporate needs to go do and anonymous stay there and address some of the more pressing issues  Bottom line it will eventually be what it was intended to be   a nice hotel for conventions  
N => the incredible staff was not worth the inconveniences I would have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel had I gone a year from now when construction is complete and once their systems are more fine tuned We were given a really awful first impression of the hotel   hectic confusing valet system poor communication between us and staff our luggage was taken and passed off to someone else and we didnt know where it went poor view they forgot to give us items upon check in such as our quotwelcome bagsquot and breakfast vouchers bad view the pool was not ready which was a HUGE disappointment as it was one of the reasons we booked at the Westin there was construction at am on the hotel the quotdualquot shower heads in the shower as described on the website we felt was misleading  it wasnt  shower heads it was a shower head with  settings like most standard shower headsBUT the staff were all very nice polite sweet charming and courtious so much so that we eventually got over all the hideousness that was our first day The food at the breakfast was great and the hotel is beautifully orated the bed was very comfortable and the atmosphere is relaxing  Id say if youre going to Montreal in  consider staying at the Westin  
N => Horrible Stay away from this Westin property This hotel and the Starwood group should be ashamed of lying and not disclosing that more than half of the facilities at this place are still not functional  A truly disappointing and at times horrific experience  Soon after we checked in at  am the water was turned off for   hours for maintenance  The fitness room was full of construction dust plastic sheets covering half the room no AC and some weird industrial smell  Pool was nowhere near complete  The room we stayed in was bare bones  No stationary No local guides No magazines No turndown    and this was one of their best rooms for a Platinum guest like me    The housekeeping cleaned the room next day while I was away and did not keep any shampoo conditioner  soap    it took  hours and  phone calls  reminders to get something delivered  Got stuck on the nd floor with non functioning elevator    several minutes of trying to get it to start  called other elevators nothing worked    called the operator she said she would send someone to check after a long wait and no show by any maintenance staff  found the staircase to climb down Called and complained to the hotel manager  He was polite apologetic    did offer me some points but was not able to transfer me to the nearby W hotel as I requested and it was too late for me to find a replacement myself  I find it disgusting that the hotel would rush to open to cash in on the visitor demand but when things fell apart wouldnt stand up and take responsibility and do the right thing  On a whole one of the worst experience anyone can have in a hotel  brand of this caliber  Starwood should be embarassed with putting out this type of shabby product in ket  
N => Good location unimpressive room for the price I ided to pay up for a premium room but was really unimpressed  I got a sitting room but it wasnt well laid out with respect to the rest of the room  My view was of the brick wall of another building so the room didnt get much lighting  The bathroom was great   really modern and clean  But in hindsight I would have been better off paying less for a smaller standard size room  Also the hotel isnt finished with construction  There was some construction noise early Friday morning   not fun when youre on vacation  The westin website led me to think that all construction was done so I expected everything that was referenced in the website to be true   including a swimming pool  Well I found out when I arrived that it was still in construction  Ugh  
N => service m diocre   
N => Was I staying at the same hotel as the others Traveling with spouse and friends for first time visit to Montreal  At check in Bellman asked what papers we would like to receive    got none Large rooms but both of them had extremely uncomfortable beds and pillows  Friends received turn down service we received nothing and are members of Loews First they are not  Concierge sent us on wild goose chase that cost us quite a few bucks only to return to hotel neighborhood to find what we were looking for on our own  Beware of rooms on street side as weekend partying gets intense into the wee hours  Other Loews we have stayed at always professional and memorable  This one needs some help 
N => Top notch service Im late with this review but needed to say that we loved this hotel when we visited Montreal at the beginning of this year  On a totally crazy whim we ided to go to Montreal in the dead of winter  And not to ski  Man oh man it was absolutely frigid that weekend So cold that the windshield wiper fluid froze the moment it hit the windshield  But the room made the whole trip totally worthwhile It was a couple of days after my dhters th birthday which I must have mentioned when I made the reservations and when we got to the room they had milk and cookies for us as well as the most gorgeous gourmet cake with a happy birthday message on it for her and a handwritten note from the manager  The room was amazing the bathroom bathtub was amazing  Very plush  Great location   easy to walk anywhere we actually did walk around in the subzero temps easy to get on the subway  And the front desk staff and concierge were all terrific  This hotel is super family friendly  When you check in they give the kids a new toy and they also have a huge jar of MampMs at the front desk which my kids helped themselves to more than they should have We got a good deal which included a free nights stay as well as a  voucher for room service Highly highly recommended  
N => Not Five Stars but seemed to be best in Montreal This hotel is perfectly fine  It has a good locations we would have preferred to be in old Montreal but their wasnt a hotel in that area that really met our needs  The hotel has good service except on the night of our arrival the concierge was not there so we had to go by the guidebooks  The hotel has amenities that you would see at a Ritz or a four seasons from the flat panel TV in the bathroom to the arate shower and bath  So i guess i would put it in the class of standard Ritzs  But this seem to be the nicest hotel in Montreal  Although the Ritz Carlton was still under constructions so we didnt get to see that hotel  
N => Great Place To Stay In Montreal Had  fantastic nights at the Vogue on our way to Tremblant at the end of ch  Top service and unbeatable location  Rooms are spacious although the carpets are a bit run down  Brilliant bathrooms   loved the jet baths  My only slight complain is that when we ordered a stretch limo to pick us up from the airport due to the fact that we had a lot of luggage we were greeted by a driver with a Sedan  After a  minute wait we ended up going to the hotel in two cars    Had we wanted to do that we would have picked up two taxis at the airport which would have cost half the price The only reason I pre booked a transfer was in order to secure a car that would fit all  of us and our luggage  Coincidentally the two Sedans cost the same as what the stretch limo would have cost  That aside I would certainly return to the Vogue 
N => Great Find Great service  The front door staff the receptionists the concierge the room service were all very friendly and polite  Our room was incredible and we loved the ble bath  The bathroom was in fact enormous  We were there in the dead of winter but having a great hotel and hotel room to come back to made our trip absolutely enjoyable  Would stay there again in a heartbeat   but pehaps wait till it wasnt freezing in Montreal  
N => Nice little Hotel Just returned from a couple of weeks in eastern Canada  Started at Loews Hotel Vogue  Found the hotel extremely comfortable and clean  Current or appealing  Good lighting in bathroom and bedroom  Liked extras   TV in bathroom magnifying makeup shaving mirror  Extra mirrored quotstationquot outside the bathroom for second person  Pretty bathrooms with spacious ble topped vanity  Had an air of elegance  Room service food very good  Felt like fine dining outWe purchased the parkingbreakfast package Concierge was extremely personable and helpful Though our room was quotnon smokingquot it smelled like smoke upon our arrival  Quickly an attendant was sent to open windows and air room out   also reking that they have a recirculating system to clear the air many times an hour  Soon the smell disappeared They cant control what goes on behind closed doorsWe were delighted with this choice  Great way to begin our trip  
N => Good but not  star We have just returned from a week in Loews Vogue  be this hotel is  star for Canadian standards but the room was a bit small and the TV set right from the s  The minibar was not refilled for the entire stay same for the coffeecups  Asking twice for a refill which took more than  minutes  Business centre had only  computers with very slow internet  Although I enjoyed my stay Loews didt gave my a  star feeling  
N => Pleasantly Surprised THE place to stay if you want to be near the action with great accomodations  Walking distance to Center Bell Crescent St  St  Catherines and churches  Rooms were comfortable and tidy  Beware the mini bar  its one that charges as soon as you move an item  Service was great as was bar and restaurant staff  Complimentary internet in lobby  Flat screen in bathrooms unique touch  Great overall experience 
N => AMAZING   will never stay anywhere else My friend and I ided to go an a mini quotgirl getawayquot to Montreal  We spent a lot of time researching and looking for the right hotel  After reading several reviews and browsing pictures we had ided on Loews Hotel  We got a very good deal on Travelzoo GREAT dealWe stayed in a Premium room which had an all ble bathroom huge with a flat screen TV in the bathroom  The room was VERY spacious and had THE most comfortable beds  And they were VERY clean Our car was valeted upon arrival  Our bags were taken straight to our rooms while we checked in  The staff was always smiling and pleasant  When calling down to front desk they always addressed you by name and were very helpful The location was fantastic  Right on the corner of Rue de la Montagne and St  Catherines  Very close to EVERYTHING  That was our main concern when searching for a place to stay  We wanted to be in the center of it all     and we wereEvery room has an iHome but please be warned that it is only built for an iPod NANO  And parking was quite expensive  per night  The mini fridge was stocked always but again just like anywhere else it was expensive  Expect to pay   for a bottle of water  SI cannot say enough good things about this hotel  Please feel free to message me if you have any questionsP S  If you log onto the hotel website and sign on to their quotFIRST LOEWSquot you have a choice of gift to your room upon arrival  We requested a bottle of red wine  Do yourselves a favour and order something else LOL 
N => Do not even look at any other hotel    Hands down this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in  Do not even bother staying in any other hotel in Montreal  I am serious  It is absolutely stunning  First and foremost I felt like ROYALTY  From the moment you pull up on the curb to the time you leave everything is pretty much done for you  By the time we reached the counter to check in our bags were on our way to our room and they even knew our name before we could say it The room was the most spacious hotel room that I have ever seen  The bed was SO comfy  The bathroom is the size of my bedroom at home Flat screen TVS and phone in bathroom  Concierge service   Take advantage Couldnt be nicer    Do not stay in any other hotel in Montreal This has to be THE best 
N => High ks to the Lowes This is a lovely well appointed centrally located and cozy place to stay in what I find to be the most convenient part of Montreal  Weve stayed here twice both times in ember and look forward to our next visit  I find it a more charming and interesting space than the Queen Elizabeth it is certainly much much smaller in terms of the number of rooms  The kids thought the TV in the bathroom was a hilarious concept but they want one in ours now too  
N => Hotel Vogue   You Really Got Me Visited Montreal to attend the Van Halen concert at the Bell Center and selected this hotel due to the great reviews of other tripadvisor members  This hotel was outstanding From the front desk that treated us as though we were their favorite customer to the fabulously huge bathroom to the comfortable bed to the terrific location for attending the event and for sightseeing the next day we were thrilled  I need to hurry up and find a reason to go back 
N => Loved Hotel Vogue Hotel Vogue was in the heart of downtown Montreal  My husband and I were there for business in the winter of   Our room was very very clean comfortable and high end  Be sure to ask for a room at the rear of the hotel so that you dont hear the nightlife of Montreal when youre ready to sleep  The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with restaurant tips maps parking etc  You can walk where ever you need to go from this hotel  Our favorite breakfast stop was just a block away One of the nights we got cht in a winter snow storm in Old Montreal and couldnt find a cab anywhere so we walked back to our hotel about  blocks or so Upon arrival around  a m  covered in snow they offered to bring some hot tea or warm cocktails up to the room for us Professional courteous staff all around 
N => Wonderful Experience   well be back My fiance and I stayed at Loews for a quick romantic weekend get away we are from New York  We stayed there during Canda Day and Jazz Festival weekend  HOTEL SERVICE The doorman and valet attendent were wonderful throughout the whole weekend  Room service staff we ordered from x were very attentative  The front desk staff was alright  The day we left we called downstairs  mins prior to check out to ask them to bring our luggage down and our car around  We waited downstairs for about  mins before asking them where our stuff was  They said the valet was getting the car and the bellman was brining down our luggage  Another  mins still no luggage or car  So my fiance went up and talked to the front desk who did not apologize but stated she thought it was here  Where we were waiting at she could clearly see there was no luggage or car for us  That was not apprecaited and left a sour taste in my mouth  Not a way to conclude a nice stay  Concierge was ok  She was not very knowledgable unless it came to tours  We brought our car so we didnt need a tour but POIs  She didnt have much to offer in relation to that  She was much better suited at dinner reservations  Loews will give you the menus of all the places that you be interested in and will call there and make your reservation once you have made your selection  Very niceFOOD Room service food was wonderful We had turkey burgers and chocolate milk  YUMMY Restaurant was ok  We went there our first night for dinner  The french onion soup is to die for For dinner I had a pasta dish that was made with oil  I asked if they could make it with alfredo sauce and the man said no problem at all  It came out with just the oil but I didnt bother to send it back  It tasted ok  We had just finished a  hour drive up there and I wasnt interested in waiting for a fresh plate  My fiance enjoyed his meal even though I cannot remember what he had  ROOM GORGEOUS it looked just like the pictures on their website  We stayed in a guest room with a canopy bed  It has been of the most luxirous beds I have ever slept it  Total comfort The suite was very clean and updated  There was even a vanity area outside of the bathroom with a bench  Really ENJOYED that feature The bathroom was all ble and gorgeous  We didnt take advantage of the tub but we did take advantage of the glass shower while watching the small flat screen in the bathroom  Nothing like watching CNN with getting all sudsy  Hopefully they will have free wi fi in the rooms one day  We brought our lap top and paid  hours to use the internet  It is free I believe downstairs on their computers and I didnt notice a line for the PCs when we were down in that area  OVERALL Highly recommend We plan on going back and bringing our Yorkies with us  We did see one or two small pets but never heard any barkingnoise from any rooms  Very clean very spacious and we cant wait to return 
N => OK experience follow up serive amazing On a recentish trip to Montreal we stayed at the Vogue  Firstly Ill just say it was a little less than I was expecting  Everything was kind of dated and the electric baseboard would buzz all night long We were lucky enough to be on the top level  We had a street side room and I wouldnt recommend it  My view was of apartments across the street who could easily see in and vice versa  Also I had to take a midday nap after Lasik surgery and I was constantly woken up by noises mostly traffic but the worst of which was the doorman constantly whistling for a taxi cab The room was fairly spacious but quite dark and likewise with the bathroom  True the whirlpool tub was quite nice but all the black ble made it very dark  The shower stall was just tiny and actually had a plastic bottom   odd Room service wasnt great  I dont know if it was due to a language problem but I never really got what I ordered and in one instance it took an hour for a grilled cheese and slice cheescake Let me just say I filled out a Survey for this Hotel and was delighted to receive a response from the Manager who apologise profusely and refunded my delayed room service  They also guaranteed I would never have this problem again Absolutely amazing and bumped up the rating on this stay As for location Its right there off a main street of shopping  It isnt near the underground city but not too far to walk to We also ate at the restaurant there and since we were the only ones there had amazing service  We were attended to and also left alone to enjoy our meals and wine  The food was really quite good and our waiter was very friendly and just generally pleasant All in all we might stay there again should we go back to Montreal  Wed probably avoid room service since the food wasnt great  Infact it was fairly average  Id insist on a back room and wed probably make a dinner reservation at the restaurant  
N => A First Class Experience My husband and I ided to spend a night in Montreal on our way to Quebec City  Prior to booking we joined their LoewsFirst Club  a MUST Not ony did this entitle us to free parking and a daily newspaper but we could also choose a complementary which would be waiting for us upon our arrival we chose a tray of fruit and bottled water  Parking and check in went smoothly and our room had lovely classical music playing when we entered  The bed was extremely comfortable The bathroom was tremendous with a arate shower a huge jacuzi bathtube a television and two bathrobes I could have spent my entire vacation in that bathroom Since I had paid for the breakfast package which is served in your room we had a continental breakfast the next morning which although delicious was quite inadequate  We were hungry within two hours  If you are booking a breakfast package I recommend pay ing a few dollars more and requesting the American breakfast  a much better deal When dining out avoid the hotels Ristorante Cellini  The food was lousy and over priced  There are much better restaurant choices in the vicinity  
N => class all the way not only is The Loews vogue hotel located in the hot spot of downtown Montreal but when you walk in there you know youve in a classy spotUpon our arrival we were greated by bell boy right outside the door  We left him the keys and went it where we were warmly welcome by the clerk who was courteous and helpful  Once in our premium room we were pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous huge bathroom with tv in spa bath  My favorite  The clerk actuall called minutes after our check in to make sure the room was to our liking  Our view was of the outdoor terrace which in the summer time might have been an issue if there was an event but in the bginning of fall ws perfect for us  The hotel has a full time concirge there to guide you for restaurants shoping and activites   although its obvious to shop at Louis Vuitton Holt Renfrew and Ogilvy which are just accross the street  The restaurant was absolutly great great service great food    But too many peoploe waiting on you at once and they dont really communicate The eager bus boy who cleared or table  times    once when we went to the bathroom and twice when we went outside to smoke  Other than that we had a  bill and it was well worth it When we finally checked out of the hotel we were escorted to our car which had a bag of treats a great thougtful gift for our roadtrip home EXCELLENT STAY 
N => Good not great Service in the hotel and at the bar is excellent  They allowed us to move our room when the noise from a nearby street concert was getting out of control  Would not recommend the restaurant at all though our distracted angry waiter messed up our breakfast order and then disappeared returning only to overcharge us  Yes the bill was fixed but it was a very unpleasant experience that management did not really care to address  Rooms are very comfy bathroom very nice  Workout room small and cramped  However the location is excellent and security elevators means you must be a guest there in order to go to any floor Woudl I stay there again Not sure  Would probably try elsewhere first  If you do stay there get a deal that includes valet the charges for valet parking are expensive  
N => Just Great This was a TripAdvisor choice and it was just greatRoom was spotlessly clean roomy comfortable and the bathroom was modern and well appointed Staff were as good as youd find anywhere and the restaurant and bar were both top class  
N => Fantastic Customer Service at Hotel Vogue We started our  week trip of Canada in Hotel Vogue and we could not have asked for a better beginning  We were slightly apprehensive of what we would find as we had got a  nights for the cost of  deal and therefore we were sure they must have scrimped on something but that was most deinitely NOT the case  Our room was enormous and clean with an amazing en suite bathroom  ble all round   large jacuzzi bath as well as arate shower and there was even a TV in the bathroom as well  The staff were friendly and polite and Phillippe the concierge assisted us advice on all sorts of things Definitely recommend it to all Hotel Vogue is also in a great part of town with everything no more than a  min walk  
N => Vogue Honeymoon We had a great time at the Vogue on our e  honeymoon  The room was large and luxurious  We particularly enjoyed the special welcome note to the new quotMr  and Mrs quot with chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival  Our luggage was lost by the airlines but the hotel staff was eager to help  They asked if we preffered to have it delivered to our room if it arrived in the middle of the night or if we would rather have them keep it at the desk until morning  We chose the former and after a phone call it was delivered at am as soon as it arrived at the hotel  We were grateful The conceirge was helpful in offering suggestions for tourist attractions and in providing a map along with personal directions to some of our destinations The room was spotless and always looked great upon our return each day  We were pleased to have the turndown service and even puttered around in the small but well equiped gym on our floor  We loved the bathroom with its whirlpool tub and mounted TV  The robes were nice to slip into as well  Well suited for romance Its in a great location nearby Metro stop St  Catherine St  and Crescent St  We walked everywhere to Old Montreal to Mont Royal to the riverfront to McGill and to wonderful shopping and restaurants in downtown  We only rode the Metro out to Olympic Park and the botanical gardens  We definitely recommend this hotel  The room was fabulous and the staff very kind I am certain that we will stay there again if we return for an anniversary  
N => The best hotel stay Ive ever experienced An understated elegance permeats this boutique hotel from the friendly yet non snobbish doormen the non flashy yet classy lobby the intimate bar the professional and sincere front desk staff to the well maintained room  Not to mention the full size ble bath tub  My first visit to the hotel was about  years ago I was very delighted to find out that everything was just perfect as I had remembered  If all the hotel staff and rooms are like this I would stop complaining about business trips as much Kudos to the management team  You should be proud of yourselves 
N => Everything we expected it to be We have never in our lives spent   Canadian per night on a hotel room and weve travelled the world  But this was our th wedding anniversary and we live close to Montreal so we were after comfort for once not a zany room in a madly exotic destination  Just for once we ided to experience what a really comfortable hotel experience was like  It was great  What I especially appreciated was that we were left alone until we needed something  Regardless of what it was and even in the middle of the night whatever it was was graciously and quietly brought to us within  minutes   rather amazing considering we were on the th floor at the very back of the hotel  The street noise cant travel that far  The room itself was beautiful and fairly sumptious most especially the bathroom as everyone has commented on Tripadvisor  One thing that I loved but hasnt been mentioned is how easy their rooms are for a woman getting ready to go out  The makeup area is well lit with a comfy vanity bench just outside the bathroom  The hairdryer is even there  Putting on makeup couldnt be faster or more comfortable  And the bed was yummy neither soft or hard  Our simple breakfast in bed of croissant jam and coffee didnt break the bank as Id worried it might  The staff are all consistently nice  They make it plain that theyre there to help  No one bothered us about not leaving the hotel so they could clean it before lunch  We chose this hotel because its the only one in Montreal dead in the centre of Montreals main shopping  Its proximity to shopping meant that I didnt waste valuable cafe sitting time travelling to take shopping back to my hotel  It costs about   for a cab to Old Montreal or up to St Denis St Laurent Laurier West or The Plateau  To give people a hand iding if youre looking for a modern hotel such as Philippe Starkes in London UK this isnt it  We had to choose between our love of ultra modern or and a classic hotel with classically good service of which Hotel Vogue is an excellent example  Montreals more modern hotels are all east of Hotel Vogue away from the downtown core  
N => Amazing Pet Friendly Hotel This was our first trip with our  Yorkies  lbs  each  When we arrived each puppy was given a gift bag of treats and practical stuff  Moments after we were in our room a bellman arrived with a large fluffy dog bed and  stainless steel bowls  This was definitely a treat for all of us The Vogue is about great service as well as lovely rooms  The bathroom was huge and the jacuzzi tub was large and fabulous  This was our rd visit to the Vogue and it wont be our last  We love the convenient location to shopping museums and restaurants  
N => Great Place to Stay We spent seven nights at Loews Vogue in a ior suite  The stay couldnt have been nicer We were pampered beyond belief  This hotel far surpasses the competition 
N => A great Hotel but    I really wanted to give this hotel  stars  In all my travels to Montreal  quite a number of them this is the nicest hotel that I have stayed at but   I booked a package online directly from the hotel website  price was amazing  got suspicious that something was wrong when my email confirmation did not reflect the package that I had selected  Called the hotel and was told by Sarah the reservations manager that the package that I thought that I had booked did not exist  luckily I had cut and pasted the information in an emailand for an additional  she would upgrade us to a bed and breakfast package but basically I was a liar  Called the corporate headquarters and lets just say that they straightened it out Room was ready early was beautiful  great spa tub and huge bathroom luxurious bedding more updated than the Ritz We came back to our room in the evening to find champagne fruit and even a birthday cake for me  almost all part of our package  Concierge got our dinner reservations done perfectly and even complimented us on our choices  but was unable to get us one restaurant we wanted But they did not clean our room the first day And it took three tries to figure out what breakfast was included with our package  we had a dinner included but opted not to use it Bottom line would come back to this hotel for the location and the rooms but you need to stand your guns and look past the fact that it seems to have a few disconnects in staffing and communication process  
N => Hotel Vogue Magnifique   Splendide   Fantastique Just returned from a two night stay at the Hotel Vogue this past weekend  I couldnt have been more pleased  Upon our arrival we were informed at checkout that we would be upgraded to a premium room with an oversized bath  Well it was glorious  The jacuzzi tub was huge and totally surrounded with ble  There were ample towels and lovely touches like the TV mounted on the vanity top and live plants   not only in the bathroom but the entire bedroomliving area as well  I mentioned at check in that I was taking my fiancee for a surprise birthday weekend in Montreal and they without hesitation offered to send up a birthday cake on the house It happened to arrive when he was in the shower so that was even better and a nice treat I highly recommend joining the quotLoews Firstquot program before you arrive  They will bring you some nice goodies in the room and keep track of your general preferences  We had a package that included a quotcontinental Breakfastquot which usually just included coffee juice and pastries  That was not the case  We were allowed to order a full size breakfast instead  another nice surprise  I did not hear a single peep of at night so I was very confused by the other reviewers complaining about the excess noise  Our room was on the top floor facing front  The negatives all seemed to be around the same week so be it was a fluke  The bed was super comfortable and the room was very spacious and tastefully orated  The location was fantastic  Just a quick stoll to all the cute restaurants on Crescent street as well as St  Catherines  We will be sure to make the Vogue our home away from home in Montreal in the future  
N => Great little hotel  Recently stayed at the Loews based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not dissapointed  We took advantage of a bed and breakfast package that also included parking  Our room was spacious nicely appointed and clean  We had a canopied queen bed which was elegant and comfortable but we should have chosen an uncanopied king for the extra room  The room had an interior view and only one window so during the day there was not much light  The bathroom was one of the nicest I have seen at any price with ble countertops jacuzzi tv arate shower and very spacious  Robes included  The only downside to this room beside the lack of light was its proximity to the elevator  When all was quiet you could hear the elevator going up and down although it was only a minor distraction  Joh the concierge was fabulous and directed us to some excellent reataurants  The hotel is centrally located to a variety of retail stores restaurants and clubs  There was always plenty to do and we were able to walk everywhere even to Old Montreal  The location of the hotel was one of the reasons we chose it and we were not dissapointed  The hotel supplied two computers with unlimited internet access if you did not want to pay for it in your room  For your information they will change your American money into Canadian but not the other way around  Also keep your itemized receipts over   and you can get a partial tax refund at the border All in all we thoroughly enjoyed Montreal and the Loews Hotel Vogue which we would recommend to anyone  
N => Very nice boutique hotel with some elevator problems This is a lovely hotel  We had a premium room which was perfect for us my husband and I were traveling w our  month old dhter  There was plenty of room for a crib in the entryway part of the room   allowed us to watch a movie after our dhter went to bed  The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and the bathroom was enormous  Loved that there was a whirlpool tub Room service breakfast was good and the concierge suggested a restaurant within walking distance that was good for our family read casual and on the slightly noisy side but with good food  The one problem we encountered was that there was a fire alarm that went off as we prepared to leave  There was an announcement that it was a false alarm but the elevators did not work for half an hour at least  We were on the th floor with a stroller so just walking downstairs was not a great option  We called the front desk and were told that the elevators would be working in quotabout a minutequot but that didnt happen when we asked for help w our luggage it took quite a while for anyone to get there  I am not blaming the hotel for the fact that the fire alarm went off and the elevator didnt work   thats whats supposed to happen when theres an alarm   but I do wish they could have given us an accurate estimate of how long things would take and that they had sent someone to help us with the bags more quickly  I am still giving it  stars because otherwise it was great and reasonably priced too but I hope they can get their staff a little better at customer service during a problem like this  
N => Top notch location comfort service etc  A group of friends and I went to Montreal for a weekend in    The leader of the trip arranged a few regular rooms plus a suite at the Loews Vogue  I was a bit nervous about the price given that there are many less expensive options in Montreal and I am typically very budget conscious  But this hotel was worth every pennyIts not a huge hotel but that translates into very attentive service  Our requests for wine glasses and other random items were met graciously and almost instantaneously  The concierge was able to help with driving directions dinner reservations and airport transportation  The maid service was superb  They never disturbed any of us they were careful not to throw away anything we might not intend to throw away and one night we returned to the suite to find they had even replenished our ice buckets and replaced our white wines exactly as we left them As other reviews have noted the beds are also extremely comfy the bathrooms are spacious and immaculate and the location is perfect When we came down to check out on our last morning we found the lobby clogged with a busload of new arrivals  Yet the concierge spotted us and ushered us over to his desk to check us out as the main desk dealt with the mammoth group I wouldnt hesitate for a second to return to this hotel  
N => Wonderful Hotel My mom and I just got back from Montreal yesterday and Id like to report that we had a very nice time  Loews Hotel was everything Id hoped it would be centrally located full of helpful knowledgeable staff clean  I booked this last minute trip through site and had requested a double bed room  When we arrived we found that we had a king sized bed room  The woman at the front desk informed me that unfortunately they had no more double room available that night but would change us to a proper room the following day  Apparently quotinternet bookingsquot rd party bookings dont always thoroughly communicate everything you request to the hotel  For the first night they brought in a rollaway bed and it was fine no big deal  They had the correct room ready for us first thing in the morning  Can I just say that the bathrooms were fabulous They were large had a arate whirlpool tub arate shower everything was in ble  I can understand if one stays in a deluxe room costing an arm and a leg each night one might expect this but these where their regular rooms and we saw two rooms both of which had the great bathrooms  Mind you most of us dont plan on spending our vacations in the bathroom but it sure was a plusThe location was perfect  We were just a few blocks from a metro station tons of shopping was all around us  We were within easy walking distance to the Musee des Beaux Arts great temporary Egyptian exhibit by the way  The lady at the concierge desk was also very helpful in our planning of a day trip to Quebec City We would certainly stay there again 
N => Could have been better  alot better I recently stayed at the Loews   I thought it would be convenient because it was downtown  it was convenient but the noise was annoying   being in the heart of downtown has it disadvantages Every morning  honkhonkhonk  this is supposed to be our vacation Service was good  a lack of helpful ideas  not strong concierge services  room was nice and spacious  but was like all the big name hotels It was alright but next time be its time to try Montreals boutique hotels  Would I recommend the Loews  probably not  
N => Loews Vogue was tops With a great deal from Travelocity we ided to visit our neighbor to the north Montreal Canada  We chose the Loews Vogue as it was priced below ket for an excursion that also included round trip air transportation  From the effortless check in to checkout this hotel was just perfect  It is a half block from the main shopping street in Montreal and very convenient to many fine local restaurants  Our room was certainly deluxe with a king bed and fine cotton linens and down pillows  The all ble bathroom had a teriffic jacquzi as well as a stall shower  The hotel service could not have been more efficient or cordial  Fitness room had a full compliment of machines to help us work off the fine dining to be had in the city  A great close less than one hour from LGA city with an excellent hotel to enjoy it from  
N => I could live in the bath tub at the vogue hotel I read the reviews submitted to you about the vogue hotel in montreal  most of the reviewers gave this hotel an excellent review and i am here to add my name to the list  this is a small boutique hotel with a fabulous location  i requested that no scented cleaning products be used no scents in the room and a quiet room away from the elevators   i didnt have to ask twice the room was beautifuland the bathtub was amazing    huge the linens were exquisite the room was well appointed and incredibly clean  the room service was wonderful   unfortunately this hotel has no concierge and the staff did not quotstep up to the platequot    overall it was a beautiful well located incredibly clean hotel   i would definitely recommend it    thought it was better than the  seasons 
N => First timers to Montreal look no further  
N => Superb Service
